**Apache Cloud Stack**: An open source cloud computing and IaaS platform developed to help make creating, deploying, and managing cloud services easier by providing a complete "stack" of features and components for cloud environments.

**Avoidance**   Eliminating the risk that is simply too high and cannot be compensated for with adequate control mechanism.

**Business Requirement**: An operational driver for decision making and input for risk management.

**Cloud Access Security Broker** (CASB)  A third-party entity offering independent identity and access management (IAM) services to CSPs and cloud customers, often as an intermediary.

**Cloud App (Cloud Application)**: The phrase used to describe a software application accessed via the Internet; may include an agent or applet installed locally on the user's device.

**Cloud Architect**: Subject matter expert for cloud computing infrastructure and deployment.

**Cloud Backup**: Backing up data to a remote, cloud-based server. As a form of cloud storage, cloud backup data is stored in an accessible form from multiple distributed resources that comprise a cloud.

**Cloud Computing Reseller**: A company that purchases hosting services from a cloud server hosting or computing provider and then resells them to its own customers.

**Cloud Computing**: A type of computing, compared to grid computing, that relies on ensuring computing resources rather than having local server or personal devices to handle applications. The goal of cloud computing is to apply traditional supercomputing or high-performance computing power, normally used by military and research facilities, to perform tens of trillions of computations per second and consumer-oriented applications such as financial portfolios, or even to deliver personalized information or power immersive computer games.

**Cloud Migration**: The process of transitioning all or part of a company's data, applications, and services from onsite premises to the cloud, where the information can be provided over the Internet on an on-demand basis.

**Cloud OS**: A phrase frequently used in place of PaaS to denote an association to cloud computing.

**Cloud Portability**: The ability to move applications and associated data between one cloud provider and another, or between legacy and cloud environments.

**Cloud Provider**: A service provider that offers customer storage or software solutions available via a public network, usually the Internet. The cloud provider dictates both the technology and operational procedures involved.

**Cloud Service Provider (CSP)**  Provides administrative assistance for the customer and the customer's data and processing needs. Examples include Amazon Web Services, Rackspace, and Microsoft's Azure.

**Cloud Services Broker (CSB)**: Typically a third-party entity or company that looks to extend or enhance value to multiple customers of cloud-based services through relationships with multiple cloud service providers. It acts as a liaison between cloud services customers and cloud service providers, selecting the best provider for each customer and monitoring the services.

**Cloud Storage**: The storage of data online in the cloud, wherein a company's data is stored in an accessible form from multiple distributed and connected resources that comprise a cloud.

**Cloud Testing**: Load and performance testing conducted on the applications and services provided by a cloud provider, particularly the capability to access the services, in order to ensure optimal performance and scalability under a wide variety of conditions.

**Cloud portability**  The ability to move applications and associated data between one cloud provider and another, or between legacy and cloud environments.

**Cloud provider**  A service provider that offers customer storage or software solutions available via a public network, usually the Internet. 

**Community Cloud**: A model where the cloud infrastructure is designed for use by a specific community. Generally, this is a community of users or consumers with shared concerns, missions, and/or security requirements.

**Data custodians** do not necessarily all have direct relationships with data owners; custodians can be third parties, or even further removed down the supply chain.

**Data owners** remain legally responsible for all data they own. This is true even if data is compromised by a data custodian several times removed from the data owner.

**Elasticity**: This is the flexibility of allocating resources as needed for immediate usage, instead of purchasing resources according to other variables. For instance, a traditional organization might purchase one desktop for every employee. In that model, the organization would be paying for the entire capacity of the desktop computer—its processing power, its storage capacity, etc.—even though individual users would probably not be using the full capacity of each device at all times.  In the cloud environment, the organization is paying not for a device, but for the use of a service, when it is being used. The ability of the cloud vendor to offer this type of service (while remaining profitable) is based on the elasticity and the flexibility offered by recent enhancements in technology, including virtualization (we will discuss virtualization further in upcoming lessons). With virtualization, the cloud provider can allocate partial usage of each resource to every user and customer, when those users and customers require it, and nothing more, thereby avoiding wasted, underutilized resources and excess, nonproductive costs.   In a virtualized environment, users can also access their data from almost any device or platform, and almost any location. This allows portability, availability, and accessibility that exceed previous enterprise environments.

**Encryption**  Offers a degree of assurance that nobody without authorization will be able to access your data in a meaningful way.

**Enterprise Application**: The term used to describe applications or software that a business would use to assist the organization in solving enterprise problems.

**Eucalyptus**: An open source cloud computing and Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) platform for enabling private clouds.

**FIPS 140-2**: A NIST document that lists accredited and outmoded cryptosystems.

Here are essential points to remember about the rights and responsibilities of data ownership and custody:

**Hybrid Cloud**: A cloud solution that mixes elements of public, private, and community cloud models.

**IaaS boundaries**  The cloud provider creates and administers the hardware assets on which the customer’s programs and data will ride.

**Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)**  Allows the customer to install all software, including operating systems (OSs) on hardware housed and connected by the cloud vendor.  One of three main categories of cloud computing services, alongside Software as a Service (SaaS) and Platform as a Service (PaaS). Offers only hardware and administration, leaving the customer responsible for the OS and other software.

**Layered defenses**  The practice of having multiple overlapping means of securing the environment with a variety of methods. 

**Managed Service Provider**: An IT service where the customer dictates both the technology and operational procedures, and an external party executes administration and operational support according to a contract.

**Mitigation**   A process of taking steps to decrease the likelihood or the impact of the risk.

**Multi-Tenant**: Multiple customers using the same public cloud (and often the same hosts, in a virtualized cloud environment).

**NIST 800-53**: A guidance document with the primary goal of ensuring that appropriate security requirements and controls are applied to all U.S. federal government information in information management systems.

**PaaS boundaries**  The cloud provider is responsible for installing, maintaining, and administering the OS(s).

**Platform as a Service (PaaS)**  Contains everything included in IaaS, with the addition of OSs. This model is especially useful for software development operations (DevOps).  A way for customers to rent hardware, operating systems, storage, and network capacity over the Internet from a cloud service provider. PaaS is one of three main categories of cloud computing services, alongside Software as a Service (SaaS) and Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS).

**Private Cloud**: The phrase used to describe a cloud computing platform that is implemented within the organization. A private cloud is designed to offer the same features and benefits of public cloud systems but removes a number of objections to the cloud computing model, including control over enterprise or customer data, worries about security, and issues connected to regulatory compliance or contractual agreements.

**Risk appetite**   Refers to the level, amount, or type of risk that the organization finds acceptable. 

**Scalability**: The organization's computing needs won't remain static: there will be new (and hopefully more) users, customers, and data as the organization continually matures. A cloud service can easily meet those needs, either temporarily or long-term, in a much more cost-efficient manner than a traditional environment, because new computing resources can be assigned and allocated without any significant additional capital investment on the part of the cloud provider, and at an incremental cost to the cloud customer.

**Simplicity**: Usage and administration of cloud services ought to be transparent to cloud customers and users; from their perspective, a digital data service is paid for and can be used, with very little additional input other than what is necessary to perform their duties. Proper cloud implementations should not require constant or even frequent interaction between the cloud provider and cloud customer.

**Software as a Service (SaaS)**  Includes everything listed in the previous Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) and Platform as a Service (PaaS) models, with the addition of software programs.  SaaS is a software delivery method that provides access to software and its functionality remotely as a web-based service. Software as a Service allows organizations to access business functionality at a cost typically less than paying for licensed application because SaaS pricing is based on a monthly fee. SaaS is one of three main categories of cloud computing services, alongside Platform as a Service (PaaS) and Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS).

**The Data Life Cycle**  create, store, use, share, archive, destroy

**The data custodian** is any organization or person who manipulates, stores, or moves the data on behalf of the data owner. Within the organization, a data custodian might be a database administrator. In the cloud context, the data custodian is usually the cloud provider. From an international perspective, the data custodian is also known as the data processor.

**The data owner** is the organization that has collected or created the data, in general terms. Within the organization, we often assign a specific data owner as being the individual with rights and responsibilities for that data; this is usually the department head or business unit manager for the office that has created or collected a certain dataset. From a cloud perspective, the cloud customer is usually the data owner. Many international treaties and frameworks refer to the data owner as the data controller.

**Transference**  A risk management strategy that involves the contractual shifting of a risk from one organization to another.

**Trusted Cloud Initiative (TCI)** Reference Model: The TCI reference model is a guide for cloud providers, allowing them to create a holistic architecture (including the physical facility of the datacenter, the logical layout of the network, and the processes necessary to utilize both) that cloud customers can purchase and use with comfort and confidence. For more information, visit Reference Architecture

**Vendor Lock-in**: Vendor lock-in occurs in a situation where a customer may be unable to leave, migrate, or transfer to an alternate provider due to technical or nontechnical constraints.

**Vendor Lock-out**: Vendor lock-out occurs when a customer is unable to recover or access their own data due to the cloud provider going into bankruptcy or otherwise leaving the market.

**Virtualization**  A process of creating a virtual version of something, including virtual computer hardware platforms, operating systems, storage devices, and computer network resources.

**Virtualization**: Creating a virtual (a logical vs. a physical) version of something, including virtual computer hardware platforms, operating systems, storage devices, and computer network resources. Computer hardware virtualization is a way of improving overall efficiency. It involves CPUs that provide support for virtualization in hardware, and other hardware components that help improve the performance of a guest environment.: This is the flexibility of allocating resources as needed for immediate usage, instead of purchasing resources according to other variables. For instance, a traditional organization might purchase one desktop for every employee. In that model, the organization would be paying for the entire capacity of the desktop computer—its processing power, its storage capacity, etc.—even though individual users would probably not be using the full capacity of each device at all times.  In the cloud environment, the organization is paying not for a device, but for the use of a service, when it is being used. The ability of the cloud vendor to offer this type of service (while remaining profitable) is based on the elasticity and the flexibility offered by recent enhancements in technology, including virtualization (we will discuss virtualization further in upcoming lessons).
