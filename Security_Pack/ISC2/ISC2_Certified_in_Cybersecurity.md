3 Goals of Information Security

Confidentiality: Protects information from unauthorized disclosure

Integrity: Protects information from unauthorized changes

Availability: Protects authorized access to systems and data / Ensures information is available to authorized users

= CIA

Confidentiality Concerns

Snooping

Involves gathering information that is left out in the open

Clean desk policies protect against snooping

Dumpster Diving

Looking through trash for information

Shredding protects against Dumpster Diving

Eavesdropping

Rules about sensitive conversations prevent eavesdropping

Wiretapping

Electronic Eavesdropping

Encryption protects against wiretapping

Social Engineering

Attacker uses psychological tricks to persuade employee to give it or give access to information

Education and Training protects against social engineering

\_\_\_\_\_

Integrity Concerns

Unauthorized Modification

Attackers make changes without permission (can be internal=employees or external

Follow the Rules of Least Privilege to prevent unauthorized modification

Impersonation

Attackers pretend to be someone else

User education protects against Impersonation

Man-in-the-Middle (MITM)

Attackers place the themselves in the middle of communication sessions

Intercepts network traffic as users are logging in to their system and assumes their role.

Impersonation on an electronic/digital level.

Encryption prevents man-in-the-middle attacks

Replay

Attackers eavesdrop on logins and reuse the captured credentials

Encryption prevents Replay attacks

\_\_\_\_\_

Availability Concerns

Denial of Service (DoS)

When a malicious individual bombards a system with an overwhelming amount of traffic.

The idea to is to send so many requests to a server that it is unable to answer any requests from legitimate users

Firewalls block unauthorized connections to protect against Denial of Service attacks

Power Outages

Having redundant power sources and back-up generators protect against power outages

Hardware Failures

Failure of servers, hard drives, network gear etc

Redundant components protect against hardware failure

Building systems that have a built-in redundancy, so that if one component fails, the other will take over

Destruction

Backup data centers protect against destruction (ex=cloud)

Service Outages

Service outage may occur due to programming errors, failure of underlying equipment, and many more reasons

Building systems that are resilient in the fact of errors and hardware failures protect against service outages

\_\_\_\_\_

Authentication & Authorization

Access Control Process

Identification

Identification involves making a claim of identity (Can be false)

Electronic identification commonly uses usernames

Authentication

Authentication requires proving a claim of identity

Electronic authentication commonly uses passwords

Authorization

Authorization ensures that an action is allowed

Electronic authorization commonly takes the form of access control lists

Access Control Lists also provides Accounting functionality

Accounting allows to track and maintain logs of user activity

Can track systems and web browsing history

Authentication + Authorization + Accounting = AAA

\_\_\_\_\_

Password Security

Controls you can implement when setting password requirements:

Password length requirements

Password complexity requirements

Password expiration requirements

Force password changes

Password history requirements

Cannot use previously used passwords

Every organization should make it easy for users to change their passwords, however, be careful of password reset process as it may provide an opportunity for attackers to take advantage through unauthorized password reset.

Password Managers

Secured password vaults often protected by biometric mechanisms (ex=fingerprints)

Facilitates the use of strong, unique passwords

Stores passwords

\_\_\_\_\_

Multi Factor Authentication

3 types of authentication factors

Something you know

Passwords, Pins

Something you are

Biometric Security Mechanisms

Fingerprints

Voice

Something you have

Software and Hardware Tokens

You combine these factors all together = Multi Factor Authentication

Note: Passwords combined with security questions are NOT multi factor authentication. Passwords and security questions are both something you know

Single Sign-On (SSO)

Shares authenticated sessions across systems

Organizations create SSO solutions within their organizations to avoid users repeatedly authenticating

\_\_\_\_\_

Non-repudiation

Prevents someone from denying the truth

Physical signatures can provide non-repudiation on contracts, receipts etc

Digital signatures use encryption to provide non-repudiation

Other methods can be biometric security controls, Video-surveillance etc

\_\_\_\_\_

Privacy

Organization Privacy Concerns

Protecting our down data

Protect your down organizations data

Educating on users

2 Types of Private Information

Personally-Identifiable Information (PII)

Any information that can be tied back to a specific individual

Protected Health Information (PHI)

Health care records

Regulated by HIPPA

Reasonable expectation of privacy

Many laws that govern whether information must be protected are based upon whether the person disclosing the information had a reasonable expectation of privacy

Ex= if you upload a YouTube video, you do not have a expectation of privacy

You do have some expectation of privacy for private electronic communications such as: email, instant chats etc

You do not have a reasonable expectation of privacy when sharing PII with an organization

You do not have a reasonable expectation of privacy when using employer resources

\_\_\_\_\_

Risk Management

Internal Risks

Risks that arise from within the organization

Internal control prevents internal risks

External Risks

Risks that arise outside the organization

Build controls that reduce the chance of attack/risks being successful (ex= multi factor authentication, or social engineering awareness campaigns)

Multiparty Risks

Risks that affect more than one organization

Intellectual property theft poses a risk to knowledge-based organizations

If attackers are able to alter, delete or steal this information, it would cause significant damage to the organization and its customers/counterparties

Software license agreements issues risk fines and legal actions for violation of license agreements

\_\_\_\_\_

Risk Assessment

Identifies and triages risks

Threat

Are external forces that jeopardize security

Threat Vector

Threat Vectors are methods used by attackers to get to their target (ex= social engineering, hacker toolkit, etc)

Vulnerabilities

Are weaknesses in your security controls

Examples : Missing patches, Promiscuous Firewall rules, other security misconfiguration

Threat + Vulnerability = Risk

\_\_\_\_\_\_

Ranking of Risks

We rank risks by likelihood and impact

Likelihood

Probability a risk will occur

Impact

Amount of damage a risk will cause

2 Categories of Risk Assessment

Qualitative Techniques

Uses subjective ratings to evaluate risk likelihood and impact: Usually in the form of low, medium or high on both the likelihood and impact scales.

Quantitative Techniques

Uses subjective numeric ratings to evaluate risk likelihood and impact

\_\_\_\_\_

Risk Treatment (Management)

Analyzes and implements possible responses to control risk

4 Types of Risk Treatment

Risk Avoidance

Changes business practices to make a risk irrelevant

Risk Transference

Attempting to shift the impact of a risk from your organization to another organization

Example : Insurance policy

Note that you cannot always transfer the risk completely. Reputation damage etc.

Risk Mitigation

Actions that reduce the likelihood or impact of a risk

Risk Acceptance

Choice to continue operations in the face of a risk

Risk Profile

Combination of risks that an organization faces

\_\_\_\_\_

Inherent Risk

Initial level of risk, before any controls are put in place

Residual Risk

Risk that is reduced and what is left of it is known as the residual risk

Control Risk

New risk that may have been introduced by the controls applied to mitigate risk

Example : Controls Applied may be installing a firewall. While that firewall may have mitigated the inherent risk, the risk of that firewall failing is another newly introduced risk

Inherent Risk → Controls Applied → (Residual Risk + Control Risk)

Risk Tolerance

Is the level of risk an organization is willing to accept

\_\_\_\_\_

Security Controls

Are procedures and mechanisms that reduce the likelihood or impact of a risk and help identify issues

Defense in Depth

Uses overlapping security controls

Different methods of security with a common objective

Security professionals uses different categories to group similar security controls

First you must group Controls by their purpose. 3 Types of Control Purposes are:

Prevent

Stops a security issue from occurring

Detect

Identify security issues requiring investigation

Correct

Remediate security issues that have already occurred

Then group them by their Control Mechanism: 3 Types of Control Mechanisms are:

Technical

Use technology to achieve control objectives

Examples: Firewalls, Encryption, Data Loss Prevention, Antivirus Software)

Technical Control a.k.a Logical Control

Administrative

Uses processes to achieve control objectives

Examples: User access reviews, log monitoring, performing background checks)

Physical

Controls that impact the physical world

Examples: Locks, Security guard

\_\_\_\_\_

Configuration Management

Tracks the way specific devices are set up

Tracks both operating system settings and the inventory of software installed on a device

Should also create Artifacts that may be used to help understand system configuration (Legend, Diagrams, etc)

Baselines

Provide a configuration snapshot

Dual Net

You can use the snapshot to assess if the settings are outside of an approved change management process system

Basically the default configuration setting set by an organization

Versioning/Version Controls

Assigns each release of a piece of software and an incrementing version number that may be used to identify any given copy

These verison #s are written as three part decimals, with the

First number representing the major version of software

Second number representing a major updates

Third number representing minor updates

Ex= IPhone IOS 14.1.2

Standardizing Device Configurations by:

Standardizing Naming conventions

IP Addressing schemas

\_\_\_\_\_

Security Governance

You must first identify how domestic and international Laws and Regulations apply to an organization

Security Policy Framework

A framework that everyone in an organization must follow

There are 4 types of documents in a Security Policy Framework

Policies

\_\_\_\_\_

Business Continuity

Business Continuity Planning (BCP)

The set of controls designed to keep a business running in the face of adversity, whether natural or man-made

Also known as Continuity Of Operations Planning (COOP)

Directly impacts the #3 goal of security = Availability

When planning, proactively as what business activities, systems, and controls will it configure

Business Impact Assessment (BIA)

A risk assessment that uses a quantitative or qualitative process

Begins by identifying organization's mission essential functions and then traces those backwards to identify the critical IT systems that support those functions

In Clouding, Business Continuity Planning requires collaboration between cloud providers and customers

Redundancy

The level of protection and against the failure of a single component

Single Point of Failure Analysis

Provides a mechanism to identify and remove single points of failure from their systems

The SPOF analysis continues until the cost of addressing risk outweighs the benefit

SPOF can be used in many areas other than the IT Infrastructure, it can be applied in management of HR, 3rd party vendor reliance etc)

\_\_\_\_\_

Continued Operation of Systems

Can be ensured in 2 ways:

High Availability

Uses multiple systems to protect against service failure (Different from AWS Cloud as in that it does not just apply to AZs but rather everything including multiple firewalls etc)

Fault-Tolerance

Makes a single system resilient against technical failures

Load Balancing

Spreads demand across available systems

Common Points of Failure

Power Supply

Contains moving parts

High failure rate

Can use multiple power supplies

Uninterruptible Power Supplies (UPS) - supplies battery to devices during brief power disruptions. UPS may be backed up by an additional power generator

Power Distribution Units (PDUs) provide power clearing and management for a rack

Storage Media

Protection against the failure of a single storage divide

Redundant Array of Inexpensive Disks (RAID) : Comes in many different forms but each is designed to provide redundancy by having more discs than needed to meet business needs

There are 2 RAID technologies

Mirroring

Considered to be RAID Lvl 1

Server contains 2 identical synchronized discs

Striping

Disc Striping with parity

RAID Lvl 5

Contains 3 or more discs

Also includes an extra disc called Parity Block

When one of the disc fails, the Parity Block is used to regenerate the failed disc's content

RAID is a Fault-Tolerance technique NOT a Back-up strategy

Networking

Improve networking redundancy by having multiple Internet service providers

Improve networking redundancy by having dual-network interface cards (NIC) or NIC Teaming (similar to how you use multiple power supplies)

Implement Multipath Networking

Fault-Tolerance mechanisms prevents systems from failing, even if one of these above points experience a complete failure

Always attempt to add Diversity in your infrastructure to improve redundancy

Diversity in Technology Used

Diversity of Vendors Diversity of Cryptography

Diversity of Security Controls

Assists organization mitigating the potential business impact of information security incidents providing practical guidance.

\_\_\_\_\_

Building a Incident Response Team

IR Team should consist of:

Management

Information Security Personnel

SMEs

Legal Counsel

Public Affairs

Human Resources

Physical Security

If your organization lacks personnels from these areas:

Use incident response service providers to assist if necessary

\_\_\_\_\_

Incident Communication Plan

Communications Plans ensure that all participants have timely, accurate information

Make sure to minimize or limit communications to third parties (Media etc)

You will have to choose whether or not to involve law enforcement

Drawbacks of law enforcement engagement can be release of sensitive details to public which may be unfavorable to the organization

Always involve your own organization's legal team to ensure compliance with laws and organization's obligations with 3rd parties.

Describe communication paths on how information will trickle down the organization

\_\_\_\_\_

Incident Identification

Organizations have a responsibility to collect, analyze and retain security information

Data is crucial to incidence detection

Incident Data Sources

IDS/IPS - Intrusion Detection System/Intrusion Prevention System

Designed to only provide an alert about a potential incident

Firewalls

Authentication Systems

Integrity Monitors

Vulnerability Scanners

System Event Logs

Netflow Records

Antimalware Packages

Security Incident and Event Management (SIEM)

Security solution that collects information from diverse sources, analyzes it for signs for security incidents and retains it for later use.

Centralized log repositories

Basically take a load of data, feed it to the SIEM, and it will spit out details regarding risk

When these systems and security mechanisms FAIL do detect risks before dealt with internally, an EXTERNAL source (customer) may be first to detect a risk

Therefore, IR Team should have a consistent method for receiving, recording, and evaluating external reports

\_\_\_\_\_

First Responder Duty

First responders (whomever they are, whom encounters the risk first) have a set of responsibilities as they may have the power to tremendously reduce risk

Highest Priority

The highest priority of a First Responder must be containing damage through isolation

\_\_\_\_\_

Disaster Recovery

Disaster Recovery (DR)

Restores normal operations as quickly as possible following a disaster

Disaster recovery plan steps in when business continuity plan fails

Disaster recovery plan effort is not finished until organization is completely back to normal

Flexibility is key during a disaster response

Initial Response Goals

Contain the damage through isolation

Recover normal operations

Communications required for an effective DR

Initial Report

Status updates

Ad hoc messages

Once Initial Response is implemented, the DR team shifts to Assessment Mode

Assessment Mode

Goal of this mode is to triage/analyze the damage and implement recover operations on a permanent basis

Depending on circumstances there may be an intermediary mode of Temporary Recovery but will gradually move to Permanent Recovery

Recovery Time Objective (RTO)

Is the targeted amount of time to restore service after disruption

Recovery Point Objective (RPO)

Is the targeted amount of data to recover

Recovery Service Level (RSL)

Is the targeted percentage of service to restore

Also the percentage of service that must be available during a disaster

\_\_\_\_\_

Backups

Technology failure

Human error

Natural disaster

Backup Methods

Tape Backups

Practice of periodically copying data from a primary storage device to a tape cartridge

Traditional method - outdated

Disk-to-disk Backups

Writes data from Primary Disks to special disks that are set aside for backup purposes

Backups that are sent to a storage area network or a network attached storage are also fitting in this category of backup

Cloud Backups

AWS, Azure, GC

Different Types of Backups

Full Backups

Include a complete copy of all data

Snapshots and images are types of full backups

Differential Backups

Includes all data modified since the last full backup

Supplements Full Backups

Incremental Backups

Include all data modified since the last full or incremental backup

Scenario: Joe performs full backups every Sunday evening and differential backups every weekday evening. His system fails on Friday morning. What backups does he restore?

A: 1) Sundays Full Backup

2) Thursday's differential backup

Scenario: Joe performs full backups every Sunday evening and incremental backups every weekday evening. His system fails on Friday morning. What backup does he restore?

A: 1) Sunday's Full Backup

2) Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday incremental backups

Trade off: Incremental backups takes longer to restore but requires smaller storage

\_\_\_\_\_

Disaster Recovery Sites

Provide alternate data processing facilities

Usually stay idle until emergency situation arises

3 Types of Disaster Recovery Sites/Alternate Processing Facility

Hot Site

Premier for of disaster recovery facility

Fully operational Data Centers

Can be activated in moments or automatically deployed

Very expensive

Cold Site

Used to restore operations eventually, but requires a significant amount of time

Empty Data Centers

Stocked with core equipment, network, and environmental controls but do not have the servers or data required to restore business

Relatively Inexpensive

Activating them may take weeks or even months

Warm Site

Hybrid of Hot and Cold

Stocked with core requirements and data

Not maintained in parallel fashion

Similar in expense as a Hot Site

Requires significant less time from IT Staff

Activating them may take hours or days

Disaster Recovery Sites don't only provide a facility for technology operations, but also serve as an Offsite Storage Location. They are:

Geographically distant

Site Resiliency

Allows backups to be physically transported to the disaster recovery facility either manually or electronically called "Site Replication"

Online or offline backups

Online backups are available for restoration immediately, but is very expensive

Offline backups may require manual intervention, but is very inexpensive

Alternate Business Process

A change of an organization's business protocols to match the current Disaster Recovery Plan

\_\_\_\_\_

Disaster Recovery Testing Goals

Validate that the plan functions correctly

Identify necessary plan updates

5 Types of Disaster Recovery Testing

Read-through

Simplest form of Disaster Recovery Testing

Asks each team member to review their role in the disaster recovery process and provide feedback

Known as "Checklist Reviews"

Walk-through

A more comprehensive approach but similar to Read-Through

Gathers the team together for a formal review of the disaster recovery plan

Known as "Tabletop Exercise "

Simulation

Uses a practice scenario to test the Disaster Recovery Plan

Scenario based- very specific circumstances

Parallel Test

While above are all theoretical approaches, the Parallel Test actually activates the Disaster Recovery Environment

However, they do not switch operations to the backup environment

Full Interruption

Most effective

Activate Disaster Recovery Environments

Also switch primary operations to the backup environment

Can be very disruptive to business

Testing strategies often combine multiple types of tests

\_\_\_\_\_

Physical Access Controls

Facilities that require Physical Security:

Data Centers

Most important

Server Rooms

Has sensitive information in less secure locations

Media Storage Facilities

If in a remote location may require as much security as the Data Centers

Evidence Storage Locations

Wiring Closets

Literally a cluster of wires

Needs to be protected as it offers access to digital eavesdroppers and network intruders

Distribution Cabling

Neatly organized cables in the ceiling

Operations Center

\_\_\_\_\_

Types of Physical Security

Visitor Procedures

Describe allowable visit purposes

Explain visit approval authority

Describe requirements for unescorted access

Explain role of visitor escorts

All visitor access to secure areas should be logged

Visitors should be clearly identified with distinctive badges

Cameras add a degree of monitoring in visitor areas

Cameras should always be disclosed

\_\_\_\_\_

Physical Security (Human Security)

Receptionists may act as Security Guards

Sometimes an "aggressive" look is sometimes desirable

Robots may replace human security patrols

Two Person Rule (Two-Person Integrity)

Two people must enter sensitive areas together

Two Person Control

Two people must have control access to very sensitive functions, requiring an agreement of 2 persons before action

Ex=Requiring 2 Keys to trigger a launch of Nuclear Missiles

\_\_\_\_\_

People on vacation should not have access to sensitive data

Managing Account Lifecycle

Ensuring that as employees move around an organization with different roles, that they are given access to corresponding roles

\_\_\_\_\_

Account Monitoring Procedures

Account Audits

Completed by pulling all permission list, review, and make adjustments

Protects against Inaccurate Permissions

Inaccurate Permissions

Wrong permissions assigned that results in too little access to do their job or too much access (violates least privilege)

Result of Privilege Creep

A condition that occurs when users switch roles and their previous role's access to system has not been revoked

Formal Attestation Process

Auditors review documentation to ensure that managers have formally approved each user's account and access permissions.

Continuous Account Monitoring

Watch for suspicious activity

Alert administrations to anomalies

Will catch any unauthorized use of permissions or acts

Flags Access Policy Violations

\_\_\_\_\_

Provisioning and Deprovisioning

Involves the process of creating, updating and deleting user accounts in multiplace applications and systems

Crucial to Identity and Access Management Task

Provisioning

After onboarding, administrators create authentication credentials and grant appropriate authorization

Deprovisioning

During the off-boarding process, administrators disable accounts and revoke authorizations at the appropriate time.

Prompt Termination (quickly acting after off boarding) is critical

Prevents users from accessing resources without permission

More important if employee leaves in unfavorable terms

Routine Workflow (For offboarding)

Disable accounts on a scheduled basis for planned departures

Emergency Workflow (For offboarding)

Immediately suspends access when user is unexpectedly terminated

Incorrect Timed Account-Deprovisioning may:

Inform a user in advance of pending termination

Allow user to access to resources after termination

It is a good idea to Deactivate the account first before permanent removal as it can be reversed

\_\_\_\_\_

Authorization

Final step in the Access Control Process

Determines what an authenticated user can do

Principle of Least Privilege

User should have the minimum set of permission necessary to perform their job

Protects against internal risks as a malicious employee's damage will be limited to their access

Protects against external risk as if an account was hacked, the damage they can do would be limited to the permissions on the stolen account.

Mandatory Access Control (MAC) System - Confidentiality

Permissions are determined by the system/operating system

Users cannot modify any permissions

Rule-based access system

Most Stringent/strict

Discretionary Access Control (DAC) System - Availability

Permissions are determined by the file owners

Most Common type of access control

Flexible

Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) Systems - Integrity

Permissions are granted to groups of people/ job functions

Group based

\_\_\_\_\_

Computer Networking

Network

Connect computers together

Can connect computers within an office (LAN) or to the global internet

Local Area Networks (LANs)

Connect devices in the same building

LANs are connected to Wide Area Networks (WANs)

Wide Area Networks (WANs)

Connect across large distances

Connects to different office locations and also to the internet

When an LAN is connected to WAN = Internet

How Devices Connect to a LAN

Ethernet

Connecting a physical Ethernet cable to an internet jack behind the ball

The Ethernet Cable is called the RJ-45 connectors a.k.a 8 Pins Connector

Super fast but requires physical cables

FYI: RJ-11 Cables are used for telephone connections. They have 6 Pins

Wireless Networks (Wi-Fi)

Create Wireless LANs

Bluetooth

Creates a Personal Area Network (PANs)

Designed to support a single person

Main purpose is to create a wireless connection between a computer and its peripheral devices

Near Field Communication (NFC) Technology

Allows extremely short range wireless connections (ex= wireless payment)

\_\_\_\_\_

TCP/IP - Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol

A set of standardized rules that allow computers to communicate on a network such as the internet.

Protocol suite at the heart of networking

Internet Protocols

Main function is to provide an addressing scheme, known as the IP address

Routes information across networks

Not just used on the internet

Can be used at home or an office

Deliver packets(chunks of information) from source → destination

Serves as a Network Layer Protocol

Supports Transport Layer Protocols - which have a higher set of responsibilities

2 Types of Transport Layer Protocols

Transmission Control Protocol (TCP)

Responsible for majority of internet traffic

Is a Connection-Oriented protocol

Connection Oriented protocol means the connection is established before data is transferred

Connection is ensured through TCP Three-Way Handshake

TCP packets include special flags that identify the packets known as TCP Flags. Within the TCP Flags:

SYN Flag: Opens a connection

FIN Flag: Closes an existing connection

ACK: Used to acknowledge a SYN or FIN packet

TCP Three-Way Handshake

Source SYN sent to request open connection to Destination

Destination sends ACK + request (SYN) to reciprocate a open connection

Source acknowledges and sends ACK

Guarantees delivery through the destination system acknowledging receipt

Widely used for critical applications (email , web traffic etc)

User Datagram Protocol (UDP)

Connectionless Protocol, not connection-oriented

Lightweight

Does NOT use Three-Way Handshake

System basically send data off to each other blindly, hoping that it is received on the other end

Does not perform acknowledgments

Does not guarantee delivery

It's often used for voice and video applications where guaranteed delivery is not essential. Every single packet doesn't have to reach the destination for video and voice to be comprehensible.

OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) Model

Describes networks as having 7 different layers

Layer 1: Physical Layer

Responsible for sending bits over the network

Uses wires, radio waves, fiber optics or other means

Layer 2: Data Link Layer

Transfers data between 2 Nodes connected to the same physical network

Layer 3: Network Layer

Expands networks to many different nodes

Internet Protocol (IP)

Layer 4: Transport Layer

Creates connection between systems

Transfers data in a reliable manner

TCP and UDP

Layer 5: Session Layerauthenti

Manages the exchange of communications between systems

Layer 6: Presentation Layer

Translates data so that it may be transmitted on a network

Encryption and Decryption

Layer 7: Application Layer

How users interact with data, using web browsers or other apps

TCP Model vs OSI Model

OSI TCP Model

Layer 1: Physical Layer

Layer 2 :Data Link Layer Layer 1: Network Interface layer (Physical + Data)

Layer 3 :Network Layer Layer 2: Internet Layer

Layer 4 :Transport Layer Layer 3: Transport Layer

Layer 5: Session Layer Layer 4: Application Layer (Session+Presentation+Application)

Layer 6: Presentation Layer

Layer 7: Application Layer

\_\_\_\_\_

For the Internet Protocol (IP) to successfully deliver traffic between any two systems on a network, it has to use an addressing scheme

IP Addresses

Uniquely identify systems on a network

Written in dotted quad notation (ex- 192.168.1.100). Also known as IPv4

Means 4 numbers separated by periods

Each of these numbers may range between 0-255

Why 255?

Each number is represented by 8-bit binary numbers

Those bits can represent 2 to the power of 8 = 256 possible values

But we start at 0 so 256-1=255

No duplicates of IP addresses on Internet-connected systems (Just like your phone#)

Allow duplicates if on private networks

Your router or firewall takes care of translating private IP Addresses to public IP addresses when you communicate over the internet

This translating process is called NAT (Network Address Translation)

IP Addresses are divided into 2 parts

1) Network Address

2) Host Address

The divide of the 2 parts can come in anywhere

This uses a concept called sub-netting

Sub-netting divides domains so traffic is routed efficiently

IPv4 (Containing 4 numbers) is running out so we are shifting to → IPv6

IPv6

Uses 128 bits (compared to 32 bits (8x4num bers = 32) for IPv4

Consists of 8 groups of 4 hexadecimal numbers

ex= fd02:24c1:b942:01f3:ead2:123a:c3d2:cf2f

IP Addresses can be assigned in 2 ways

Static IPs

Manually assigned IP Address by an administrator

Must be unique

Must be within appropriate range for the network

Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP)

Automatic assignment of IP Address from an administrator configured pool

Typically,

Servers are configured with Static IP Addresses

End-user devices are configured with Dynamically-Changing IP Addresses

\_\_\_\_\_

Network Ports

Like Apartment #s, guide traffic to the correct final destination

IP addresses uniquely identifies a system while the Network Ports uniquely identifies a particular location of a system associated with a specific application

Think of it as

IP Addresses - Street # of an Apartment

Network Ports- Unit # of an Apartment

Network Port Numbers

16-bit binary numbers

2 to the power of 16 = 65,646 possible values

65,646-1 (for 0) = 0-65,535 possibilities

Port Ranges

0 - 1,023 = Well-known ports

Reserved for common applications that are assigned by internet authorities

Ensures everyone on the internet will know how to find common services such as : web servers, email servers

Web-servers use the Well-known port 80

Secure Web-servers use the Well-known port 443

1,024 - 49,151 = Registered ports

Application vendors may register their applications to use these ports

Examples

Microsoft Reserve port 1433 for SQL Server database connections

Oracle Reserve port 1521 for Database

49,152 - 65,535 = Dynamic ports

Applications can use on a temporary basis

Important Port #s

Administrative Services

Port 21 : File Transfer Protocol (FTP)

Transfers data between systems

Port 22 : Secure Shell (SSH)

Encrypted administrative connections to servers

Port 3389 : Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP)

Encrypted administrative connections to servers

Securing Wireless Networks

Service Set Identifier (SSID)

The name of your Wi-Fi

You can disable visibility of Wi-Fi (Hide)

Has an administrative password to the access point (connection)

Ensure to immediately change default administrator passwords

You can configure what Type of Network you want

1) Open Network

Open for anyone to use (No Password Wifi)

2) Other authentication required Network

1) Preshared Keys (Home Wifi, Office, Cafe)

Changing Preshared keys is difficult

Prevents individual identification of users

2) Enterprise Authentication

Uses individual passwords

3) Captive Portals

Used in Starbucks, Airports, Tim-Hortons

Provide authentication on unencrypted wireless networks

Intercepts web requests to require Wi-Fi login

\_\_\_\_\_

Wireless Encryption

A best practice for network security

Encryption hides the true content of network traffic from those without the decryption key

Takes, Radio Waves, and makes it secure

The Original approach to Security was: Wired Equival7ent Privacy (WEP)

This is now considered insecure

The Second approach was : Wi-Fi Protected Access (WPA)

Changes keys with the Temporal Key Integrity Protocol (TKIP)

Changes the encryption key for each packet : preventing an attacker from discovering the key after monitoring the network for along period of time

This is now considered insecure

The Improved approach is : Wi-Fi Protected Access v2 (WPA2)

Uses an advanced encryption protocol called Counter Mode Cipher Block Chaining Message Authentication Code Protocol (CCMP)

WPA is now considered SECURE

The New approach is : Wi-Fi Protected Access v3 (WPA3)

Supports Simultaneous Authentication of Equals (SAE)

SAE is a secure key exchange protocol based upon the Diffie-Hellman Technique, to provide more secure initial setup of encrypted wireless communications

Also supports CCMP protocol

In Summary,

Open Network : Insecure

WEP : Insecure

WPA: Insecure

WPA2 : Secure

WPA3: Secure

\_\_\_\_\_

Ping and Traceroute

Command Line Network (CLI)

Provides quick and easy way to access network configurations and troubleshooting information

Used my giving Commands

Important Commands

ping

Checks whether a remote system is responding or accessible

Works using the Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP)

Basically sending a request and acknowledgement to confirm a connection

Troublingshooting with Ping:

You can ping the remote system:

a) if you receive a response : it is not a network issue and a local web server issue

b) if you don't receive a response : you may next ping another system located on the internet : if that responds : this will tell you your internet is successful and the issue is with the web server or network connection

c) if you ping many systems on internet and there is no response, it is likely that the problem is on your end

d) You can ping a system on your Local Network : if that responds, there's probably an issue with your network's connection to the internet

e) If a Local Network does not respond : Either your Local network is down or there is a problem with your computer

f) Last Resort : Repeat process on another computer

Some systems do not respond to ping requests

Example : A firewall may block ping requests

hping

Creates customized ping requests

A variant of the basic "ping" command

Allows you to interrogate a system to see if it is present on the network

Old and not monitored but still works

traceroute

Determines the network path between two systems

If you want to know how packets are traveling today from my system Located in Toronto to a LinkedIn.com webserver, wherever that is located

Works only on Mac and Linux

In Windows, it is : tracert

pathping

Windows only command

Combines ping and tracert functionality in a single command

\_\_\_\_\_

Network Threats

Malware

One of the most significant threats to computer security

Short for Malicious Software

Might steal information, damage data or disrupt normal use of the system

Malwares have 2 components:

1) Propagation Mechanism

Techniques the malware uses to spread from one system to another

2) Payload

Malicious actions taken by malware

Any type of malware can carry any type of payload

Types of Malware

Virus

Spreads after a user takes some type of user action

Example : Opening an email attachment, Clicking a Link, Inserting an infected USB

Viruses do not spread unless someone gives them a hand

User education protects against viruses

Worms

Spread on their own by exploiting vulnerabilities

When a worm infects a system, it will use it as it's base for spreading to other parts of the Local Area Network

Worms spread because the systems are vulnerable

Patching protects against worms

Trojan Horse

Pretends to be a useful legitimate software, with hidden malicious effect

When you run the software, it may perform as expected however will have payloads behind the scene

Application Control protects against Trojan Horses

Application Controls limit software that can run on systems to titles and versions

\_\_\_\_\_

Botnets

Are a collection of zombie computers used for malicious purposes

A network of infected systems

Steal computing power, network bandwidth, and storage capacity

A hacker creating a botnet begins by

1) Infecting a system with malware through any methods

2) Once the malware takes control of the system (hacker gains control), he or she joins/adds it to the preconceived botnet

How are Botnets Used

Renting out computing power for profit

Delivering spam

Engaging in DDoS attacks

Mining Bitcoin and Cryptocurrencies

Perform Brute Force Attacks - against passwords

Botnet Command and Control

Hackers command botnets through Command and Control Networks as they relay orders

Communication must be indirect (hides the hackers true location) and redundant

Must be highly redundant (too much, alot) because security analysts will shut them down one by one. Its a cat and mouse game, whoever controls the Command and Control channels retains control of the Botnet the longest

Types of Command and Control Mechanisms for Ordering Botnets

Internet Relay Chat (IRC)

Twitter

Peer to Peer within the Botnet

In Summary Botnets:

Infect Systems

Convert to bots

Infect others

Check in through Command and Control Network

Get Instructions

Deliver payload

\_\_\_\_\_

Eavesdropping Attacks

All eavesdropping attacks rely on a compromised communication path between a client and a server

Network Device Tapping

DNS poisoning

ARP poisoning

During poisoning attacks hackers may use the Man-in-the-Middle technique to trick the user to connect to the attacker directly, then the attacker directly connects to the server. Now the original user logs in to a fake server set up by the attacker and the attacker acts as a relay, the man in the middle, and can view all of the communications.

The user will not know that there is a Man-in-the-Middle intercepting communications.

Man-in-the-browser Attacks

Variation of Man-in-the-Middle attack

Exploit flaws in browsers and browser plugins to gain access to web communications

If the attacker is able to control the network traffic, they may be able to conduct a Reply Attack

Replay Attack

Uses previously captured data, such as an encrypted authentication token, to create a separate connection to the server that's authenticated but does not involve the real end user

The attacker cannot see the actually encoded credentials

They can only see the encoded version of them

Prevent Replay Attacks by including unique characteristics:

Token

Timestamp

SSL Stripping

Tricks browsers into using unencrypted communications

A variation of eavesdropping attack

A hacker who has the ability to view a user's encrypted web communication exploits the vulnerability to trick the users browser into reverting to unencrypted communications for the world to see

Strips the SSL or TLS protection

\_\_\_\_\_

Implementation of Attacks

Cryptographic systems may have flaws = vulnerability = attacks

Fault Injection Attacks

Use externally forced errors

Attacker attempts to compromise the integrity of a cryptic device by causing some type of external fault

For example : Attacker might use high-voltage electricity to cause malfunction that undermines security

These failures of security may cause systems to fail to encrypt data property.

Side Channel Attacks

Measure encryption footprints

Attackers use footprints monitor system activity and to retrieve information that is actively being encrypted

For example : If a cryptographic system is improperly implemented, it may be possible for an attacker to capture the electromagnetic radiation emanating from that system and use the collected signal to determine the plain text information that is being encrypted

Timing Attacks

A type of Side Channel Attack

Measure encryption time

Attackers precisely measures how long cryptographic operations take to complete, gaining information about cryptographic process that may be used to undermine security

\_\_\_\_\_

Threat Identification and Prevention

Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS)

Monitors network traffic for signs of malicious activity

MIS USE DETECTION AND ANOMALY DETECTION

Examples of malicious activity

SQL Injections

Malformed Packets

Unusual Logins

Botnet Traffic

Alerts administrators

Requires someone to take action

Intrusion Prevention System (IPS)

Automatically block malicious activity

It is not a perfect system. They make 2 errors

1) False Positive Error

IDS/IPS triggers an alert when an attack did not actually take place

2) False Negative Error

IDS/IPS fails to trigger an alert when an actual attack occurs

Technology used to identify suspicious traffic:

Signature Detection Systems

Contain databases with rules describing malicious activity

Alert admins to traffic matching signatures = Rule based Detection

Cannot detect brand new attacks

Reduce false positive rates

Reliable and time-tested technology

Anomaly Detection Systems

Builds models of "normal" activity, and finds an Outlier

Can detect brand ne attacks

But has high false positive rate

Anomaly Detection , Behavior-based Detection , Heuristic Detection = Same Thing

\_\_\_\_\_

IPS Deployment Modes

In-band Deployments

IPS sits in the path of network traffic

It can block suspicious traffic from entering the network

Risk : It is a single point of failure so it may disrupt the entire network

Out-of-band (passive) Deployments

IPS sits outside of network traffic

IPS is connected to a SPAN port on a switch

Which allows it to receive copies all traffic sent through the network to scan

It cannot disrupt the flow of traffic

It can react after suspicious traffic enters the network

It cannot pre detect as it can only know its existence once it enters the network

\_\_\_\_\_

Malware Prevention

Antimalware software protects against many different threats

Antimalware software protects against viruses, worms, Trojan Horses and spyware

Antivirus software uses 2 types of mechanisms to protect:

Signature Detection

Watches for known patterns of malware activity

Behavior Detection

Watches for deviations from normal patterns of activity

This type of mechanism is found in advanced malware protection tools like the Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR)

Offer real-time, advanced protection

Goes beyond basic signature detection and performs deep instrumentation of endpoints

They analyze:

Memory

Processor use

Registry Entries

Network Communications

Installed on Endpoint devices

Can perform Sandboxing

Isolates malicious content

\_\_\_\_\_

Port Scanners

Vulnerability Assessment Tools

Port Scanner

Looks for open network ports

Equivalent of rattling all doorknobs looking for unlocked doors

nmap

Popular port scanning tool /command

Vulnerability Scanner

Looks for known vulnerabilities

Scans deeper than Port Scanner, actually looks at what services are using those ports

Has a database for all known vulnerability exploits and tests server to see if it contains any of those vulnerabilities

Nesssus

Popular vulnerability scanner

Application Scanner

Tests deep into application security flaws

\_\_\_\_\_

Network Security Infrastructure

Data Centers

Have significant cooling requirements

Current Standard of Temperatures

Maintain data center air temperatures between 64.6 F and 80.6 F = Expanded Environmental Envelope

Humidity is also important

Dewpoint says : Humidity 41.9 F and 50.0 F

This temperature prevents condensation and static electricity

HVAC is important (Heating, Ventilation and Air Conditioning Systems)

Must also look out for fire, flooding, electromagnetic interference

Fire Suppression Methods

Wet Pipe Systems

Contains water in the pipes ready to deploy when a fire strikes

High Risk for data center

Dry Pipe Systems

Do not contain water until the valve opens during a fire alarm.

Prevents burst pipes, by removing standby water

Chemical Systems

Removes oxygen

Always place MOUs

Memorandum of Understanding

Outlines the environmental requirements

\_\_\_\_\_

Security Zones

Firewalls divide networks into security zones to protect systems of differing security models

Types of Security Zones

Network Border Firewall

Three network interfaces, connects 3:

Internet

Intranet

Data Center Network

Guest Network

Wireless Network

Endpoint Network

DMZ

You can place systems that must accept connections from the outside world such as mail, web servers

Because it is open, higher risk of compromise

If the DMZ is compromised, firewalls will still protect

Zero Trust Approach : Systems do not gain any trust based solely upon their network location

3 Special-Purpose Networks

Extranet

Special intranet segments that are accessible by outside parties like business partners

Honeynet

Decoy networks designed to attract attackers

Ad Hoc Networks

Temporary networks that may bypass security controls

East-West Traffic

Network traffic between systems located in data center

North-South Traffic

Networks traffic between systems in the data center and systems on the Internet

\_\_\_\_\_

Routers and Switches

Routers, Switches and Bridges are the building blocks of computer networks

Switches

Connect devices to the network

Has many network ports

Reside in wiring closets and connect the computers in a building together

Ethernet jacks are at the other end of network cables connected to switches

Wireless access points (WAPs) connect to switches and create Wi-Fi networks

The Physical APs itself has a wired connection back to the switch

Switches can only create Local Networks

Layer 2 of OSI Model - Data Link Layer

Some switches can be in the Layer 3 of OSI Model - Network Layer (can interpret IP Addresses)

For this to happen, they must use Routers

Routers

Connect networks to each other, making intelligent packet routing decisions

Serves as a central aggregation point for network traffic heading to or from a large network

Works as the air traffic controller of the network

Makes best path decisions for traffic to follow

Use Access Control Lists to limit some traffic that are entering or leaving a network, this type of filtering does not pay attention to Connection states and are called

Stateless Inspection

\_\_\_\_\_

Virtual LANs (VLANs)

Separates systems on a network into logical groups based upon function

Extend broadcast domain

Users on the same VLAN will be able to directly contact each other as if they were connected to the same switch

We use VLANs to create network segmentation which reduces security risk by liming the ability of unrelated systems to communicate with each other

Micro Segmentation

Extreme segmentation strategy

Temporary

Configuring VLANs

Enable VLAN trunking

Allow switches in different locations on the network to carry the same VLANs

Configure VLANs for each switch port

\_\_\_\_\_

Firewalls

Often sit at the network perimeter

Between Router and Internet

Switch

Switch

Firewalls connect 3 networks together

Internet

Internal Network

DMZ

Contains systems that must accept direct external connections

Isolates those systems due to risk of compromise

Protects internal network from compromised DMZ systems

Older Firewalls use Stateless Firewalls

Evaluate each connection independently

Modern Firewalls use Stateful Inspection

Keeps track of established connection

Firewalls are basically rules to enter or exit.

Firewall rule must provide

Source system address

Destination system address

Destination port and protocol

Action (Allow or Deny)

Firewalls operate on the Principle of Implicit Deny

If the firewall receives traffic not explicitly allowed by a firewall rule, then that traffic must be blocked

Basically saying, if you don't have a passcard, you cannot get in as the door is always closed

The Newest type of Firewalls are called New Generation Firewalls (NGFW)

Incorporate contextual information into their decision making

Evaluate requests based on identity of user, nature of application, time of day etc.

Other Firewall Roles

Network Address Translation (NAT) Gateway

The firewall translates between the public IP Addresses used on the internet and private IP Addresses used on the local networks

Content/URL Filtering

Web application firewall

Understands how HTTP protocol works and dive deep into those application connections, looking for signs of SQL Injection, Cross-site scripting, and other web application attacks

Firewall Deployment Options

Choose deployment methodology

Network Hardware

Physical devices that sit on a network and regulate traffic

Host-Based software Firewalls

Software applications that reside on a server that performs other functions

Most organizations choose to use both network firewalls

2) Choose between Open-source Vs Proprietary technology

Network Hardware are always Proprietary

Software Firewalls may be either Proprietary or Open Source

3) Choose Deployment Mechanism

Hardware Appliance

Virtual Appliance

\_\_\_\_\_

VPNs and VPN Concentrators

VPNs provide 2 security functions:

Site-to-Site VPNs

Connect remote offices to each other and headquarters

Ex= Branch → HQ

Remote Access VPNs

Provide remote access to corporate networks for mobile users

VPNs

Works by using encryption to create a virtual tunnel between two systems over the internet

Everything on one tunnel is encrypted and decrypted when it exits

VPNs require an endpoint that accepts VPN connections

Endpoints can be many things:

Firewalls

Router

Server

Dedicated VPN Concentrators - Used for High Volume

Firewalls, Router, Server does not contain specialized hardware that accelerates

Encryption

IPSec (Internet Protocol Security) Protocol

Creates encrypted tunnels

Works at Layer 3 : Network Layer

Supports Layer 2 Tunneling Protocol (L2TP)

Provides secure transport

Difficult to configure

Often used for Static Site-to-Site VPN Tunnels

SSL/TLS VPNs

Works at the Application Layer over TCP port 443

Works on any system on a web browser

Port 443 = Almost bypass any firewall

HTML5 VPNs

Work entirely within the web browser

A remote access VPN

When implementing a remote Access VPN admins must choose :

Full Tunnel VPN

All network traffic leaving the connected device is routed through the VPN tunnel, regardless of final destination

Split Tunnel VPN

Only traffic destined for the corporate network is sent through the VPN tunnel

Other traffic is routed directly over the Internet (risk of eavesdropping)

Not as safe so not recommended

Split-Tunnel VPN provides users with a false sense of security

Always on VPN

Connects automatically

Takes control from the user

Always protected by strong encryption

\_\_\_\_\_

Network Access Control (NAC)

Intercepts network traffic coming from unknown devices and verifies that the system and users are authorized before allowing further communication

Uses 802.1x authentication. This requires 3 devices

Supplicant - Device that sends request

Authenticator - The switch

Authentication Server - Backend

Supplicant(Sends credentials) → Authenticator(Receives and passes it to AS) → Authenticator Server (authenticates and sends results to authenticator → Authenticator → Supplicant → Access

NAC Roles

User and device authentication (what we discussed above)

Role-based access

Once authenticator learns the identity of requested user it places the user in the network based upon that user's identity

Posture checking/Health Checking

Before granting access, it check for compliance requirements

Validating current signatures

Verifying for antivirus presence

Ensuring proper firewall configuration

If it Fails the posture check

It will be placed into a quarantine VLAN where they will have limited internet access and no access to internal resources

Posture checking is done through an Agent or Agentless

\_\_\_\_\_

Internet of Things

Smart devices

IOT Security Challenges

Difficult to update

Connect to home and office wireless (Risk for malicious actors)

Connects back to cloud services for command and control, creating a pathway for external attackers

Security of IOT

Check for weak default passwords

Make sure to regularly update and patch

Some have Automatic Updates and some require Manual Websites

If worried get Firmware Version Control

Updates are applied in orderly fashion

Security Wrappers (For organizations that must run vulnerable systems)

Mini firewall for devices

Device is not directly reached through network

Only process vetted requests

Most secure way is Network Segmentation - isolating network to a isolated section where they will not have access to trusted networks

Application firewalls provide added protection for embedded devices

Network Segmentation is the most important control for embedded devices

Works in 2 ways

1) Network-Based CASB

Broker intercepts traffic between the user and the cloud service, monitoring for security issues

Broker can block request

2) API- Based CASB

Does not sit on traffic unlike Network-Based CASB

The broker queries the cloud service via API

Broker may not be able to block requests, depending upon API capabilities

Symmetric vs Asymmetric Cryptography

Symmetric Encryption

You encrypt and decrypt with the same shared secret key

It's like a password to a message

You will keep needing more keys as network populates

Asymmetric Encryption

Hash Functions

One-way function that transforms a variable length input into a unique, fixed-length output

One-way function = Cannot be reversed

The output of a hash function will always be same length, regardless of input size

No two inputs to a hash function should produce the same output

All criterias above must be met to have an effective Hash Function

2 Ways Hash Function can fail:

If they are reversible

If they are not collision-resistant

Common Hash Functions

You must know which functions are considered insecure and which remain secure

Message Digest 5 (MD5)

Ron Rivest created MD5 in 1991

MD5 is the 5th series of hash functions

Message digest is another term for hash

MD5 produces 128-bit hashes

MD5 is no longer secure

SHA-1

Produces a 160-bit hash value

Contains security flaws

SHA-1 is no longer secure

SHA-2

Replaced SHA-1

Consists of a family of 6 has functions

Produces output of 224, 256, 384 and 512 bits

Uses a mathematically similar approach to SHA-1 and MD5

SHA-2 is no longer secure

SHA-3

Designed to replace SHA-2

Uses a completely different has generation approach than SHA-2

Produces hashes of user-selected fixed strength

Some people do not trust SHA algorithms because NSA created it

RIPEMD

Created as an alternative to government-sponsored hash functions

Produces 128, 160, 256, and 320-bit hashes

Contains flaws in the 128-bit version

160 bit is widely used. Even in Bitcoin
