# 1.1 Linux Evolution and Popular Operating Systems #

## Topics ##

* Open Source Philosophy
* The birth of Linux
* Distributions
* Embedded Systems
* Comparison with other popular Operating Systems

### Open Source Philosophy ###

**Source** refers to the source code or the actual text code that is compiled to make a program.  
  
Having access to the code allows you to understand how the program works and perhaps to contribute additions to the program. 

This means there are many 100s and perhaps 1000s of contributors to the code.

### The Birth of Linux ##

The first Linux kernel, the core of the Operating System, was released in 1991 by a student from Helsinki University, Linux Torvalds.  

In 1992 was re-released under the GNU license that opened the kernel to the wealth of GNU (Not Unix programs and utilities).  

### Linux Distributions ###

* A distribution is the kernel packages with installers and additional software. This makes the kernel usable to humans:
  * Red Hat Enterprise Linux
  * SUSE Enterprise Linux
  * Ubuntu
  * Debian
  * openSUSE
  * Fedora
  * Linux Mint
* The website distrowatch.com keeps track of downloads. 

### Embedded Systems ###

* You are also going to find Linux in many devices:  
  * TiVo boxes
  * Network Storage Servers
  * Print Servers
  * Android Phones
* Linux is free so it makes sense to use a free OS when building a dedicated server

## Comparison with other OSs ##

* **MAC OSX:** This uses a version of BSD Unix, not dissimilar to Linux. Using the command line on OSX is going to be very similar to Linux
* **Windows:** Windows has made a huge success out of the Graphical Interface but are starting to move back towards command line with PowerShell
* **UNIX:** Linux was born out of Unix but with the requisite to be free and open source

## 1.2 Major Open Source Applications ##

* Desktop Applications
* Server Applications
* Mobile Applications
* Development Languages
* Package Management Tools and Repositories

### Desktop Applications ###

* **LibreOffice:** Office suite
* **Firefox:** Browser
* **Thunderbird:** Email client
* **Gimp:** Photo editing and graphics
* **Audacity:** Manage and edit sound files
* These applications are cross platform, they can run on Windows, Mac, and Linux

### Server Applications (Services) ###

* Apache: Web server
* MySQL, MariaDB, PostgreSQL Database Servers
* Squid: Web proxy
* NFS: Linux and Unix File Server
* SAMBA: Windows, File, Print Server and Domain Server
* openLDAP: Directory Server
* DNS / DHCP: Network Infrastructure services

### Mobile Applications ###

* Linux is Linux is Linux, it does not differ between server, desktop and mobile Linux
* Windows CE, Windows 8 mobile are different OSs to the Windows Desktop and Server, as is Server different from Desktop
* Many Linux server and desktop apps then will work on mobile Linux, Android.
* Some mobile Linux apps will be written from the ground up for mobile devices

### Development Languages ###

* Simple “scripts” can be made to automate tasks using **shell scripting (.sh)**
* **PHP** is often used to provide access to Databases from Apache (LAMP: Linux Apache MySQL PHP)(.php)
* **Perl:** Perl scripting is effective and cross platform (.pl)
* **Python:** Due to its power, simplicity, and complete object model, Python has become the scripting language of choice for many large organizations (.py)

### Package Management Tools and Repositories ###

* The Apple Store; The Microsoft Store, we might think these innovative and useful
* They are not new and Linux has used Software Repositories for years
* A software repository, or repo, is an online location where software can be installed from
* Of course, you will not need your credit card for Linux repos

### Accessing the Repo ###

Different distributions will use different tools

* Red Hat, CentOS: Use YUM
* SUSE uses ZYPPER
* Ubuntu uses APT-GET
In essence, they all do the same job in locating software from defined repositories and installing the software along with any dependency packages

## 1.3 Understanding Open Source Software and Licensing ##

* Open Source Licensing
* Free Software Foundation (FSF)
* Open Source Initiative (OSI)
* Open Source Business Models

### Open Source Licensing ###

* The most common license that we will come across is the GPL license, GNU General Public License
* Others exist, such as the BSD License, (FreeBSD license) and the Creative Commons License
* In all there are about 70 licenses that can refer to Open Source

### GPL 2 ###

* The current version is GPL 3, much software though still uses the established GPL 2 license and dates back to June 1991, predating the Linux Kernel

### GPL 3 ###

* The current GPL which now dates to 2007, was updated to cover patenting and the abuse of the previous GPL on mobile devices where users could not modify the code

### BSD ###

* The BSD License hails from the University of California
* The original owner can still copyright the source and binaries but free distribution is permitted
  * Redistributions of source code must retain the above copyright notice, this list of conditions, and the following disclaimer.
  * Redistributions in binary form must reproduce the above copyright notice, this list of conditions and the following disclaimer in the documentation and/or other materials provided with the distribution.

### Creative Commons ###

* This refers to written works such as manuals and how-tos
* Different CC licenses may require the work to be attributed to the original owner or may prohibit commercial reuse

### Free Software Foundation ###

* Founded by Richard Stallman in 1985
* Defines free software as:
  * The freedom to run the program, for any purpose
  * The freedom to study how the program works, and change it so it does your computing as you wish
  * The freedom to redistribute copies so you can help your neighbor
  * The freedom to distribute copies of your modified versions to others
* Thus, “free software” is a matter of liberty, not price. To understand the concept, you should think of “free” as in “free speech,” not as in “free beer”.

### Open Source Initiative ###

* The OSI are the maintainers of many of the open source software licenses
* They define themselves as the stewards of the Open Source definition
* Not for profit organization founded in 1998

### Open Source Business Models ###

* Companies like RedHat, SUSE, and Canonical, do very well in providing enterprise level support based on subscription
* There are many ways to make money by providing software or services for free.

## 1.4 ICT Skills and Working in Linux ##

* Desktop Skills
* Accessing the Command Line
* Industry uses of Linux, Cloud Computing and Virtualization

### Desktop Skills ###

* Identify different Linux Windows Managers
  * KDE
  * GNOME
  * Unity
* Logging in and out, using the browser, configuration option
* Managing passwords
* Permissions
* Using open source applications and your office suite

### Accessing the Command Line ###

* Terminal
* Console
* SSH

### Industry Uses for Linux ###

* You are going to find Linux commonly as servers but as desktops in some organizations
* Virtualization hosts such as Citrix Xenserver are Linux based
* Many virtual appliances for both VMWare and XenServer are Linux based.
