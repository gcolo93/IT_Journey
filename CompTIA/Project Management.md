**Identify the Characteristics of a Project**

**Projects:**

- temporary in nature
- definite start and end date
- creates a unique product, service, or result

**Project vs. Operations**

- **Project:**
  - Meets a specific business need
  - Always temporary
  - Must have clearly defined and measurable goals
- **Operations or processes**
  - Ongoing effort
  - Repetitive

**The Project Management Triangle**

- **Constraints:**
  - Time: The amount of time available to complete a project
  - Cost: The budgeted amount available for the project
  - Scope: What must be done to produce the project’s end result
- Changing one value causes the other two values to change, sometimes drastically.

- Transfer or handoff of each phase

**Initiation Phases**

- Recognizes the beginning of the project

- Define scope
- Identify the deliverables
- Ascertain the duration and resources
- Phase output: the project charter

**Planning Phase**

- Define the budget
- Identify risks
- Identify resources
- Phase output: the project management plan

**Execution Phase**

- The real work begins
- Execute your plan
- Coordinate staff

- Analyze the issues associated with the deviations
- Execute approved changes
- Phase output: take corrective action

**Closure**

- Turn over deliverables
- Closure of the project
- Release resources
- Close contracts
- Review project
- Create a final report
- Phase output: formal acceptance and sign-off

Forward pass

- Early start (ES)
  - Earliest a task can begin
- Early finish (EF)
  - Earliest a task can finish
- EF = ES + duration - 1

Backward pass

- Late finish (LF)
  - Latest a task can finish
- Late start (LS)
  - latest a task can start
- LS = LF - duration + 1

Float: LS - ES or LF - EF

Scheduling methods

- Summary chart
  - Shows activities as bars
  - begin and end date
  - duration
- Gantt Chart

- Optimizing the distribution of work among resources
- Delaying
  - Avoid over allocation
  - Spread out tasks
  - Lengthen the scheduled time
  - Could effect project

Schedule compression

Earned Value Analysis (EVA)

- used to measure actual vs planned
  - time, costs
- calculating a dollar amount to every activity
- What will it do for me?
  - measure a project’s progress
  - forecast its completion date and final cost
  - provide schedule and budget variances along the way

Measuring performance

- variance analysis
  - comparison of planned results with actual results
- trend analysis
  - using past results to predict the future

Calculating Earned Value

- Earned value (EV)
  - value of work performed so far
- planned value (PV)
  - planned cost of work
- actual cost (AC)
  - actual cost of the work completed
- budget at completion (BAC)
  - amount budgeted for the entire project
- EV = BAC \* value(%) of work completed
  - $2000 (BAC) \* 65% = $1300 (EV)

Variance Analysis

- cost variance (CV)
  - CV = EV - AC
- schedule variance (SV)
  - SV = EV - PV
- cost performance index (CPI)
  - CPI = EV / AC
- schedule performance index (SPI)
  - SPI = EV / PV

CPI

- If CPI > 1.0, cost is less than budgeted
- If CPI < 1.0, cost is greater than budgeted

SPI

- If SPI > 1.0, project is ahead of schedule
- If SPI < 1.0, project is behind schedule

Trend Analysis

- predict the future
- what is expected
- project progress to date
- estimate at completion (EAC)
- Estimate to completion (ETC)
- variance at completion (VAC)

Estimate at Completion (EAC)

- Actual cost (AC) plus an estimate of costs for the remaining work
- EAC = BAC / CPI

Estimate to Completion (ETC)

- Estimated cost of completing the remaining work
- ETC = EAC - AC

Variance at Completion (VAC)

- Estimate of the variance between BAC and EAC
- VAC = BAC - EAC

**Formulas**

Estimating: length of project activities

- o = best case estimate
- ml = most likely estimate
- p = worst case estimate
- e = estimate
  - Three point estimate 
    - e = (o + ml + p) / 3
  - PERT (Program Evaluation and Review Technique)
    - PERT is a better calculation method
    - e = (o + (4 \* ml) + p) / 6

Float:

- ES = early start
- EF = early finish
- LF = late finish
- LS = late start
- Float = LS - ES or LF - EF
  - Forward Pass: EF = ES + duration - 1
  - Backward Pass: LS = LF - duration + 1

Risk Analysis:

- Risk = Probability \* Impact
  - Risk ($)
  - Probability (%)
  - Impact ($)

Earned Value Analysis:

- EV = BAC \* Value of work completed %
  - EV: Earned value
  - PV: planned value
  - AC: actual cost
  - BAC: budget at completion

Variance analysis:

- CV = EV - AC — Cost Variance
- SV = EV - PV — Schedule Variance
- CPI = EV / AC —- Cost Performance Index (CPI)
- SPI = EV / PV —- Schedule Performance Index (SPI)
  - CPI > 1.0, cost is less than budgeted
  - SPI > 1.0, project is ahead of schedule

Trend analysis:

- Estimate at Completion (EAC)
  - EAC = BAC / CPI
- Estimate to Completion (ETC)
  - ETC = EAC - AC
- Variance at Completion (VAC)
