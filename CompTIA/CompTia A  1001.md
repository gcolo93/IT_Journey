**An Overview of IPv4 and IPv6 2.6**

**IP addressing**

- IPv4 is the primary protocol for everything we do
  - You probably won’t configure anything else
- IPv6 is slowly appearing

**IPv4 addresses**

- Internet Protocol version 4
  - OSI Layer 3 address
  - i.e. 192.16.1.11
  - Each section is 8 bits long
  - 11000000.10101000.00000001.10000011
  - 8 bits = 1 byte = 1 octet
- Since one byte is 8 bits, the maximum decimal value for each byte is 255

**IPv6 addresses**

- Internet Protocol v6 - 128-bit address
  - 340 undecillion addresses
- Your DNS will become very important!
- First 64 bits is generally the network prefix (/64)
- Last 64 bits is then the host network address

**Networking with IPv4**

- IP Address, e.g., 192.168.1.165
  - Every device needs a unique IP address
- Subnet mask, e.g. 255.255.255.0
  - Used by the local device to determine what subnet it’s on
    - The subnet mask isn’t (usually) transmitted across the network
    - You’ll ask for the subnet mask all the time
      - What’s the subnet mask of this network?
- Default gateway, e.g., 192.168.1.1
  - The router that allows you to communicate outside of your local subnet
  - The default gateway must be an IP address on the local subnet

**DNS servers**

- We remember names
  - Professormesser.com, google.com, youtube.com
- Internet routers don’t know names
  - Routers only know IP addresses
- Something has to translate between names and IP addresses
  - Domain Name Services
- You configure TWO DNS servers in your IP configuration
  - That’s how important it is


**Assigning IP Addresses 2.6**

**DHCP**

- IPv4 address configuration used to be manual
  - IP address, subnet mask, gateway, DNS servers, NTP servers, etc.
- October 1993 - The bootstrap protocol
  - BOOTP
- BOOTP didn’t automatically define everything
  - Some manual configurations were still required
  - BOOTP also didn’t know when an IP address might be available again
- Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP)
  - Initially released in 1997, updated through the years
  - Provides automatic address / IP configuration for almost all devices

**Step 1: Discover**

**Step 2: Offer**

**Step 3: Request**

**Step 4: Acknowledge**

**Turning dynamic into static**

- DHCP assigns an IP address from the first available from a large pool of addresses
  - Your IP address will occasionally change
- You may not want your IP address to change
  - Server, printer, oor personal preference
- Disable DHCP on the device
  - Configure the IP address information manually
  - Requires additional administration
- Configure an IP reservation on the DHCP server
  - Associate a specific MAC address with an IP address

**Automatic Private IP Addressing (APIPA)**

- A link-local address
  - No forwarding by routers
- IETF has reserved 169.254.0.1 through 169.254.255.254
  - First and last 256 addresses are reserved
  - Functional block of 169.254.1.0 through 169.254.254.255
- Automatically assigned
  - Uses ARP too confirm the address isn’t currently in use

**IPv6 link-local addresses**

- A non-routable local network address
  - Will only work on the local subnet
- Required on every IPv6-enabled interface
  - You may see many IPv6 addresses per interface
- fe80::/10 with only one subnet allocated (all zeros)
  - Effectively becomes fe80::/64
- The last 64 bits are usually created with a modified EUI-64
  - Based on the MAC address

- Bad application
- Check with a test page

**OS issues**

- Unable to install printer
  - Drivers are important OS updates
  - User must have proper rights
  - Check the printer driver
    - 32 bit vs. 64 bit
- Backed up print queue
  - Printer server not working
  - Print spooler crash
    - Restart the spooler
    - Change recovery options

**Error messages**

- Error codes
  - On the printer display
  - Today’s printers have large LCDs
- Low memory errors
  - Laser printers build the entire page in memory
  - Complex images and graphics consume more memory

**No output**

- Check the printer
  - Getting power? Check for display message
  - Run a test printer from the printer
- Check the connectivity
  - Print a test page from a computer
  - Check direct connection
  - Try across network
  - Tests the operating system, network, drivers, and spooler
- Check other applications
  - Print from another program

**Multiple failed jobs in logs**

- Corrupted print jobs
  - Print spooler will crash
  - Most spooler configuration will automatically restart

- One job may be causing the issue
  - Monitor the queue for details

**Troubleshooting Network 5.7**

**No network connectivity**

- Do you have a link light?
  - Is it plugged in?
- Ping loopback (127.0.0.1)
  - Is the protocol stack working?
  - Availability and intermittent connectivity
- Ping local IP address
  - Checks local configuration, adapter, and link signal
- Ping default gateway
  - Connectivity on the local network
- Ping devices on router’s other side
  - 8.8.8.8

**Automatic Private IP addressing (APIPA)**

- A link-local address
  - No forwarding by routers
- IETF has allocated 162.254.1.0 through 162.254.254.255
  - 169.254.0.0/24 and 169.254.255.0/24 are reserved
- Automatically assigned
  - Uses ARP to confirm the address isn’t currently in use
- Check your IP address
  - Is it an APIPA address?

**Local resources unavailable**

- Shares
  - Server unavailable
  - Share permissions have been modified
  - Relies on DNS to find the server
- Printers
  - Device sharing printer (or printer) is unavailable
  - Printer permissions have been modified
- Email
  - Service is associated with a specific server
  - May be a cluster of servers
  - Problems may be related to the servers or the network path

**Limited or no connectivity**

- Windows alert in system tray
  - “Limited or no connectivity”
  - No Internet access
- Check local IP address
  - An APIPA address will only have local connectivity
- If DHCP address is obtained, perform the ping tests
  - Local gateway, remote IP address

**Intermittent connectivity**

- Internet access
  - Then nothing
- Check the system tray
  - A broken LAN icon is a loss of signal
  - Check for a cable problem
  - Might have bad network interfaces
- Problem with switch or wireless access point
  - Bad interfaces 
  - Router rebooting

**IP conflicts**

- DHCP helps
  - But static addresses can conflict
- Windows will identify a duplicate
  - And prevent a conflict
- Two identical IP addresses will conflict
  - Intermittent connectivity, if any
- Reboot or reset the NIC
  - Start over from the beginning

**Slow transfer speeds**

- Frustrating to the user
  - Challenging to the technician
- Router or infrastructure congestion
  - Overloaded network or devices
- Speed and duplex incompatibility
  - An easy fix
- Hardware issue with the adapter
  - Or your cabling
- Malware infection

**Low RF wireless signal**

- Interference
  - Something else is using our frequency
- Signal strength
  - Transmitting signal, transmitting antenna, receiving antenna, etc.
- Incorrect channel
  - Usually automatic; look for manual tuning
- Bounce and latency
  - Multipath interference; flat surfaces
- Incorrect access point placement
  - Locate close to the users

**Wireless interference**

- Predictable
  - Fluorescent lights
  - Microwave ovens
  - Cordless telephones
  - High-power sources
- Unpredictable
  - Multi-tenant building
- Measurements
  - Signal strength
  - Performance monitor

**SSID not found**

- Network name doesn’t appear
  - Other networks are there
- Too far away
  - Local networks are louder
- Wireless router has disabled SSID advertisements
  - It will never appear on a list
  - You can still manually connect
