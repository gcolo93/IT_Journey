**Four Value of the Agile Manifesto**

- Individuals and interactions over processes and tools
- Working software over comprehensive documentation
- Customer collaboration over contract negotiation
- Responding to change over following a plan

**Scrum Stakeholders**

- Scrum master
- Team members
- Stakeholders
- Users
- Product owner

**Product Owner**

- Product Owner is responsible for the Product Backlog
  - Ensures each user story is easy to understand
  - Communicates with customers to keep the Product Backlog updated
  - Measures the performance of the project
  - Forecasts completion data and makes this information transparent
- Team and Product Owner work together
  - Too much work a Sprint
  - Only the Product owner can cancel a sprint

**Scrum Master**

- Scrum master fully understands Scrum
- Coaches the Scrum team to ensure all Scrum processes are implemented (eg, Daily Scrum)
- Management position, which manages the Scrum process, rather than the Scrum Team
- Servant-leader for the Scrum Team
- Leads the organization to adopt Scrum

**Scrum Master**

- Helps those outside the Scrum Team understand the appropriate interactions with the Scrum Team
- Possible for a single person to be Scrum Master and a team member, although this is not recommended.

**Development Team**

- Experts that are responsible for delivering backlog items and managing their efforts
  - Cross-functional: capable of the creation of each Product Backlog item
  - Self-organized: find their own way instead of receiving orders
- Whole Development Team responsible and accountable; no individual owns any task
- Development Team delivers the final product of the project in step by step increments, as defined in the product backlog

**Development Team Considerations**

- Bring the team together and let them self-organize
- Existing teams can propose how they want to organize
- Large projects use a scaled model with multiple Scrum Teams
  - Multiple Scrum teams are not common
  - Adding Scrum teams won’t affect productivity
  - Multiple Dev Teams should be self-forming
  - All teams need a common definition of done
  - All teams should have same Sprint starting date

  - EV - PV
  - 100,000 - 137,500 = -37,500

**Measuring Performance**

- Cost Performance Index (CPI)
  - EV / AC
  - 100k/112k = .89

  - 100k/137,500 = .73

**Predicting the Future**

- Estimate at Completion (EAC)
  - BAC / CPI
