**Section 2: Initiating the Project**

**Identify the Project Selection Process**

- Strategic relevance
  - Align with the organization’s strategic goals
- Operational relevance
  - Project objectives defined by tactical management

**Starting a New Project**

- Business Value
  - Tangible
  - Intangible
- Management prioritizes projects
  - Scope
  - Schedule
  - Costs
- Project conceptualizing
  - Goals
  - Requirements
  - DoD
- Project planning tools
  - Brainstorming
  - MS Project
  - Excel
- Statement of Work
  - Business case
  - Project Scope Statement

**Organizational Process Assets**

- Past projects
- Data analysis
- Look at what’s worked, didn’t work

**Prepare for Success**

- How do you know you’re done?
- How do you know you’re successful?
- Ask! Communication is key



**Project Requirements**

- Business requirements - business value
- Functional requirements - behavior of the product
- Technical requirements - how the product works

**Project Selection Decision Models**

- Benefits measurement models
  - Forecasted revenue
  - Time value of money
  - Internal rate of return
- Mathematical models
  - Business constraints
  - Profitability

**Capital Budgeting**

- New equipment, machinery, and facilities
- Large projects or purchase of fixed assets
- Payback period, discounted Cash Flow, and Net Present Value

**Decision-Making Tools**

- Decision tree
  - Selection criteria are arranged along the branches of a tree
  - Project is evaluated against criterion on each branch
- Criteria profiling
  - One criterion at a time
  - Considered even if it fails to meet some of the criteria
- Weighted factor
  - One point per low-priority criterion
  - three points per high-priority criterion
- Q-sorting based on given criteria (value, priority, ROI)
  - People rate the relative priority of a number of projects
  - Deck of cards with a different project listed on each card
  - Sorts the deck into high, medium, and low
  - Projects chosen from the consensus of high-priority projects
- Delphi Technique
  - Rounds of anonymous surveys to foster consensus
  - Asked to rate a project on a zero-to-ten scale with reasons
  - Results given to participants
  - Participants can revise ratings

**Feasibility Analysis**

- Determine if proposed projects are feasible
- Formal study includes:
  - Description of the problem
  - Summary of available technologies
  - Evaluation of organization’s technical capability
  - Estimate of costs and time
  - Assumptions and constraints
  - Recommendation
  - Statement of project goals

**Cultural Feasibility**

- Measurement of the organization’s project support
  - Belief that the project can help or hinder
  - Technical proficiency of the customers
  - Key business processes affected
  - Who affected business processes

**Technical Feasibility**

- Analyze the technical considerations of a proposed project
  - Ever been attempted before?
  - Project will interact with mission-critical systems?
  - Project team experience?
- Can project impact be accurately re-created and tested in a simulation.

**First-time / First-use Penalty**

- Never attempted before
- Penalty of time, cost, and learning

**Cost-Benefit Analysis**

- Estimated costs and predicted benefits
- Quantitative information needed over expectations
- Document assumptions used in the analysis

**Workflow Analysis**

- Formally documents how work gets done
- Displays work in a flowchart
- Breaks down complex work into discrete tasks
- You must already know how to do the work
- Technology can be applied to improve efficiency?

**Use Cases, Prototypes, and Scenarios**

- Use case analysis
  - Decomposes requirements into user functions
  - Each use case is an event or sequence of actions performed by the user
- Prototype
  - Simulated version of new system
  - Wireframes or mockups
- Scenarios
  - Method for developing potential eventualities for situation
  - What-if scenarios

**Prepare a Project SOW**

- Business need
- Project work
- Can be internal or external
  - Internal SOW via project sponsor
  - Project SOW
  - External SOW to / from vendor
  - Often included with outgoing vendor requests

**Project SOW**

- Describes results the project will deliver
  - Market demand
  - Technological advance
  - Legal requirement
  - Government regulation(s)
  - Environmental consideration
- High-level scope definition
  - Product, service, or result
  - High-level requirements
- Strategic plan
  - Organizational strategic vision, goals, and objectives

**Guidelines for Preparing a Project SOW**

- Provide direction and definition to a project
  - Description and the high-level scope of the project
  - Major deliverables and any anticipated milestones
  - Resource requirements
  - High-level project risks
  - Defines success criteria

**Develop Project Charter**

- Authorizes the project and project manager
- Authorized external to the project
- Appropriate power
- Portfolio Steering Committee

**Developing the Project Charter**

- Project purpose
- Measurable project objectives
- High-level requirements
- Overall project risk
- Summary milestone schedule
- Pre approved financial resources
- Key stakeholders
- Approval requirements
- Exit criteria - close or cancel
- Assigned project manager
- Sponsor

**Project Business Case**

- Economic feasibility study
- Validity of benefits the project will create
- Future project management decisions and actions
- Maintained throughout the project
- Project sponsor completes development and maintenance
- Project manager responsible for providing recommendations
- Business case could be at the program level

**Business Case Components**

- Business need: project purpose
- Project contribution: organization’s objectives
- Stakeholders: identification, their expectations, and contributions
- Constraints: project limitations
- Strategic risks: potential threats and opportunities
- Benefits evaluation: key benefits
- Project roles: project team job and roles
- Benefits realization plan: benefits of project
- Contingency plan: alternate solutions for unplanned events


**What is a stakeholder?**

- Anyone affected by the project
- Anyone that can affect the project
  - Internal
  - External

**Key Project Stakeholders**

- Sponsor
- Project manager
- Team members
- Customers
- Suppliers
- Government agencies
- Project management office

**Stakeholder Analysis**

- Stakeholder analysis approach:
  - Identify all potential stakeholders
