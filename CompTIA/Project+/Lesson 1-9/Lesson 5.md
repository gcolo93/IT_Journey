**Section 5: Developing the Project Schedule**

**Develop Schedule**

- Sequence of activities
- Durations of activities
- When resources are needed
- Establishes logical relationships among activities

**Consider Project Constraints**

- When and how work can be implemented
- Opportunity to profit from a market window
- Work within the parameters of expected weather
- Adhere to government requirements
- Industry regulations, best practices, or guidelines
- Time frames for delivery of materials

**Project Constraints**

- Must start on
- Must finish on
- Start no earlier than
- Start no later than
- Finish no earlier than
- Finish no later than

**Assumptions and Scheduling**

- New work
- Risks
- Force majeure
- Labor
- Effort

**Risks and the Schedule**

- Risk is an uncertain event or condition
- Knowns and unknowns
- Risk analysis affects completion
- Risk affects costs and time




**Schedule Network Analysis**

- Find earliest completion date
- Find latest completion date
- Find opportunities to shift resources
- Find opportunities to delay
- SWOT

**Finding Float**

- Free float: An activity can be delayed without delaying the early start of any successor activities
- Total float: An activity can be delayed without delaying project completion
- Project float: A project can be delayed without passing the customer-expected completion date.

**Forward Pass:** ES + du - 1 = EF Path

**Backward Pass:** LF - dur + 1 = LS

**Find Float:** LF - EF or LS - ES

**Critical Chain Methodology**

- Considers resource limitations and adjusts the schedule
- Established by analyzing the critical path alongside the needed and available resources
- Uses buffers rather than float

**What-if Scenario Analysis**

- What if x happens?
- Compute different outcomes
- Feasibility of project schedule
- PMIS - Project Management Information System









**Schedule Simulation**

- Monte Carlo analysis
  - Risks used to calculate possible schedule outcomes
  - Calculate multiple work package durations
- Utilizes different:
  - Activity assumptions
  - Constraints
  - Risks
  - Issues
  - Probability distributions

**Gantt Chart**

- Shows all activities and where they are according to the project schedule

**Using Resource Leveling Heuristics**

- Limits labor in time period
- Often extends the project schedule

**Using Resource Smoothing**

- Limits labor except for critical path
- Tries to adhere to deadline

**Schedule Compression**

- Crashing adds people and costs
- Fast tracking adds risk and overlaps

**Crash Cost Plotting Methods**

- Techniques for analyzing the crash costs
- Shows lowest crash cost per week
- Activities with flatter slopes have relatively larger time savings
- Crashing may result in increased risk and rework
- Team needs to identify where it becomes impractical to crash the schedule

**Create the Schedule Baseline**

- Management-approved version of the project schedule
- Based on schedule network analysis
- Includes baseline start and finish dates
- Measuring and reporting schedule performance


**Guidelines for Establishing a Schedule Baseline**

- Preliminary project schedule
- Project’s start and finish dates
- Must be accurate and up-to-date
  - Resources
  - Task duration
  - Calendars
  - Predecessor dates
  - Dependencies
  - Cost estimates
  - Constraints

**Establishing a Schedule Baseline**

- Resources can’t be over allocated
- Incorporate changes to the schedule baseline
- Changes to schedule baseline may require resources or time
- Schedule changes after approval requires formal change process
- Version the original baseline for variance analysis
