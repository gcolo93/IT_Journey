**Section 6: Planning Project Costs**

**Estimate Project Costs**

- Rough Order of Magnitude (ROM) estimate
  - Developed without any detailed base data and often based on high-level historical data, expert judgment, or a costing model
  - Accuracy: -25% to +75%
- Range of estimate
  - Alternative to ROM where the accuracy of the estimate is not well known
  - Accuracy: +/- 35%
- Approximate estimate
  - Lacks detail required for high accuracy
  - Accuracy: +/- 15%
- Budgetary estimate
  - Often used for appropriation purposes
  - Accuracy: -10% to +25%
- Definitive (or control or detailed) estimate
  - Based on detailed information about project work
  - Definitive estimate is developed by estimating the cost for each work package in the WBS
  - Accuracy: -5% to +10%
- Phased (or rolling wave or moving window) estimate
  - Allows for the use of ROM or approximate estimates for later parts of work, while work that must be done earlier in the project life cycle is estimated at the definitive level.
  - Accuracy: +/- 5% to +/- 15% in the window closest to present time; +/- 35% farther in the future

**Seller Selection**

- Weighting system
- Independent estimates
- Screening systems
- Contract negotiation
- Seller rating systems
- Expert judgment
- Proposal evaluation




**Use Analogous Estimating**

- Analogous estimating relies on historical information
- Top-down estimating
- Actual cost of historical project as basis for current project
- Form of expert judgment
- Less time to complete, but also less accurate

**Using Parametric Estimating**

- Mathematical model based on known parameters to predict cost
- Parameters can vary based on the work being completed
- Measured by cost per cubic yard, cost per unit, and so on
- A complex parameter can be cost per unit, with adjustment factors
- Cost per square foot
- Cost per ton

**Using Bottom-Up Estimating**

- Bottom-up estimating starts from zero
- Accounts for each component of the WBS
- Creates a sum for the project

**Bottom-Up Estimating**

- Completed with the project team
- One of the most time-consuming methods used
- More expensive to create, because of time invested
- Most accurate methods
- Project team sees the cost and value of each activity

**Three-Point Estimates**

- Finds an average of
  - Optimistic
  - Most likely
  - Pessimistic
  - Also called triangular distribution
- (O+ML+P)/3=Estimate

**PERT** **Estimates**

- Program Evaluation and Review Technique
- Also called beta distribution
- (O+(4ML)+P)/6=Estimate

**Determine Budget**

- Aggregating the estimated costs
- Cost of work packages and activities
- Authorized cost baseline
- Excludes management reserves
- Includes contingency reserves

**Developing the Project Budget**

- Cost estimating happens first
- Cost budget happens based on reliable estimate
- Actual commitment of funds to project work
- Pre-assigned budget

**Creating the Cost Baseline**

- Measures performance
- Predicts expenses over the project life
- Usually shown as an S-curve
- Predicts when monies are spent
- Discrepancies early are a signal that the project is slipping

**Larger Projects and the Cost Baseline**

- May use multiple cost baselines for costs within each phase
- Predict spending plans
- Show cash flows of the project
- Overall project performance

**Cost Assignment Methods**

- 50/50 percent rule
  - 50 percent credit is given when the activity begins and the remaining 50 percent credit is given when the work is completed
- Percentage complete rule
  - Specific reporting intervals
- Weighted milestones
  - Each milestone has a value
  - Milestone completion

**Funding Limit Reconciliation**

- Reconcile planned and actual costs
- Cost variances
- Corrective actions

**Establishing Project Funding Requirements**

- Project funding requirements can be mapped to the project schedule
- Cost baseline helps determine when the project will need cash
  - Phases Milestones
  - Capital expenses
- Project step funding

**Phases and Cost Funding**

- Phase gates
- Stage gates
- Review gates
- Kill points
