**Section 8: Planning Project Quality Management**

**Cost for Project Quality Management**

- Most expensive approach is to let the customer find the defects
- QC keep mistakes away from customers
- QA examines and corrects processes
- Incorporate quality planning
- Create a culture throughout the organization that is committed to quality in processes and products

**Cost of Quality**

- Cost of conformance
  - Safety measures
  - Team development and training
  - Proper materials and processes
- Cost of non-conformance
  - Liabilities, loss of life or limb
  - Rework/scrap
  - Lost business

**Types of Quality Costs**

- Prevention
  - Quality assurance
  - Delivery of the exact project scope and the expected quality.
- Appraisal
  - Quality control
  - Cost of measuring, testing, auditing, and evaluating
  - Time for testing
- Failure
  - Internal failure: scrap and rework
  - External failure: loss of sales, loss of customers, downtime, and damage to reputation.

**Looking at the Big Quality Picture**

- What constitutes quality?
- Quality is:
  - Totality of an entity
  - Satisfies needed abilities
  - Stated or implied needs

**Quality Terminology**

- Measurable terms
- Requirements
- Beware of gold plating
- Definite terms
  - Fast
  - Reliable
  - Happy

**Quality Project Management**

- Customer satisfaction
  - Conformance to requirements
  - Fitness for use
- Prevention
  - Quality is planned into a project, not inspected in it
- Management responsibility
- Deming’s “Plan-Do-Check-Act”

**Quality Management Terms**

- Prevention: keeping errors out of the process
- Inspection: keeping errors out of the customers’ hands
- Attribute sampling: results either conforms or does not conform

**Leaders in Quality Management**

- W. Edwards Deming
  - Deming cycle focuses on continuous process improvement in which quality must be continuously improved in order to meet customer needs.
- Joseph M. Juran
  - Juran Trilogy breaks quality management into quality planning, control, and improvement
- Philip Crosby
  - Quality is conformance to requirements rather than a measure of how good a product or service is.
- Genichi Taguchi
  - Taguchi method emphasizes that quality should be designed into the product; factors that cause variation can be identified and controlled.
- William (Bill) Smith, Jr.
  - Six Sigma emphasizes responding to customer needs and improving processes by systematically removing defects.

**Determining the Quality Policy**

- Formal quality approaches
  - ISO programs
  - Six Sigma
  - Total Quality Management
- If a quality policy doesn’t exist the project manager must create one for the project.

**Standards and Regulations**

- Standards are optional
- Regulations are requirements

**Manage Quality: Key Tools and Techniques**

- Checklist
- Alternatives analysis
- Document analysis
- Process analysis
- Root cause analysis (RCA)
- Matrix diagrams
- Scatter diagrams
- Cause-and-effect diagrams
- Flowcharts
- Histograms

**Creating a Flowchart**

- Flowcharts illustrate the flow of a process through a system
- Process flowchart does not have to be limited to the project management activities

**Cause-and-Effect diagram**

- Fishbone diagram
- Ishikawa diagram

**Creating a Control Chart**

- Typically used in projects or operations with repetitive activities
  - Manufacturing
  - Testing series
  - Help desks


**Sigma Values and Control Charts**

- The specifications are established by customer requirements
- Within the customer requirements are the upper control limits (UCLs) and the lower control limits (LCLs).
- The UCL is typically set at +3 or +6 sigma, while the LCL is set at -3 or -6 sigma

**Design of Experiments**

- Examines variables to determine best outcome
- One million postcards
- The best results win

**Quality Management Plan**

- Control quality: results are monitored for quality standards
  - Poor results need root-cause analysis
  - Quality control is inception-driven
- Managing quality: performance must meet quality standards
  - QA maps to a quality policy
  - QA is typically a managerial process
- Quality improvement: corrective actions improve the project
  - Improvements depend on quality philosophy of the organization
- Quality standards
- Quality objectives
- Roles and responsibilities
- Deliverables and processes subject to quality review
- Quality control
- Quality tools
- Nonconformance issues

**Quality Metrics in Quality Plan**

- Quality metrics describe a project or product characteristic
- Control quality to verify compliance
  - Percentage of tasks completed on time
  - Cost performance
  - Failure rate
  - Number of defects per day
  - Total downtime per month
  - Errors found per line of code
  - Customer satisfaction scores
