**Determine Stakeholders’ Needs**

- Project objectives from stakeholders’ perspective
  - Consistent with organizational strategies, policies, and procedures
  - Specific
  - Quantifiable
  - Realistic and attainable

**Exploring Customer Requirements**

- Customers’ needs and expectations
  - Conformance to standards
  - Quality
  - Data management
  - Security and control
  - Technical, training and performance support, and deployment

**Interviewing Stakeholders**

- Stakeholder register
- One-to-one
- One-to-many
- Many-to-many

**Focus Groups**

- Trained moderator-guided interactive discussions
- Form of qualitative research
- Elicit stakeholders’ and SMEs’ expectations
- Moderated event
- 6-12 people
- Neutral moderator
- Participant composition

**Facilitated Workshop**

- Group sessions of multidisciplinary or cross-functional stakeholders
- Define project or product requirements
- Build trust, foster relationships, reconcile differences
- Improve communication among the stakeholders
- Joint application design
  - Software development
  - SMEs and dev team meet to gather requirements
- Quality function deployment
  - Voice of the customer
  - Manufacturing industry
  - Workshop to rank and identify characteristics for new product development

**Group Creativity Techniques**

- Brainstorming: used to generate and create multiple ideas
- Nominal group technique: voting to rank brainstorming results
- Delphi technique: rounds of anonymous surveys for consensus
- Idea (or mind) mapping: brainstorming ideas in a map to illustrate commonality, differences, and new ideas
- Affinity diagram: sorting of a large number of ideas collected during brainstorming into distinct categories for analysis

**Questionnaires and Surveys**

- Large group
- Paper-based
- Web-based
- Geographical concerns

**Using Group Decisions**

- Unanimity - everyone agrees
- Majority - more than 50 percent agrees
- Plurality - largest block agrees
- Dictatorship - power decides

**Multicriteria Analysis**

- Determine, rank, and eliminate project criteria
  - Performance metrics
  - Risks
  - Requirements
- Utilize a table called a “decision matrix” to measure and score

**Affinity Diagram**

- Creativity technique used to identify solutions
- Groups ideas into clusters, each of which can be broken down again to analyze each subset
- Decomposition and organization of project ideas and requirements

**Stakeholder Observation**

- Job shadowing
- Passive
- Active (participant observer)

**Requirements Traceability Matrix**

- Current status
- Requirement name
- Link to business and project objectives
- Project scope and WBS entry
- Data, coding, cost, or schedule
- Status - active, canceled, deferred, added, approved, assigned, or completed
- Testing activities
- Comments or notes

**Managing the Project Requirements**

- Based on requirements collection
- Requirements documentation
- Requirements traceability matrix

**Product Scope**

- Characteristics of customers’ deliverable
- Product backlog in adaptive
- Product scope is derived from collect requirements
- Validate scope is product scope information

**Prototypes**

- Throw-away prototypes
- Functional prototypes
- Storyboarding

**Scope and Project Completion**

- Project scope is measured against project plan
- Product scope is measured against project requirements
- Requirements are conditions or capabilities





**Defining the Project Scope Statement**

- Developing a detailed description of the project and product
- Describes the product, service, or result
- Establishes boundaries and acceptance criteria

**Define Scope**

- Project scope statement
- Scope baseline

  - Consultants
  - Stakeholders, including customers
  - Professional and technical associations
  - Industry groups
  - Subject matter experts

**Product Analysis**
