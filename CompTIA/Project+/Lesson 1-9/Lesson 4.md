**Section 4: Preparing to Develop the Project Schedule**

**Creating the Work Breakdown Structure**

- Decomposition of the project scope
- Subdivide the project work
- Smallest item is work package

**Create WBS**

- Process of decomposing the project scope
- Deliverables-oriented
- Not the activities list
- Project planning tools
- Visualizes the project
- Defines what’s in scope
- Deterrent to scope change

**Finalizing the WBS**

- Control accounts for work packages
- Code of accounts - unique identifier

**WBS Templates**

- Historical information
- Pre-populated deliverables
- Sometimes called a WBT

**WBS Dictionary**

- Code of account identifier
- Description of work
- Assumptions and constraints
- Responsible organization
- List of schedule milestone
- Associated schedule activities
- Resources required
- Cost estimates Acceptance criteria Technical references
- Contract information

**Scope Baseline**

- Project scope statement
- WBS
- WBS dictionary

**Decompose Project Activities**

- Activity list and work packages
- 8/80 Rule
- Requires three inputs:
  - Scope baseline
  - Enterprise environmental factors
  - Organizational process assets

**Activity List**

- Separate document
- Lists all project activities
- Activity identifier
- Scope of work description

**Duration and Effort**

- Duration: amount of time a task will take to complete
- Fixed duration: requires a set amount of time to complete
- Elapsed time: actual calendar time
- Effort-driven: the task can be completed faster with more effort

**Effort and Project Activities**

- Level of effort (LOE) activities are support activities
  - Reporting
  - Budgeting
- Discrete effort activities required to complete the project scope
- Apportioned effort is project management work
  - Quality assurance
  - Integrated change control
  - Communications

**Milestone Chart**

- Up triangle is planned
- Down triangle is actual
- Line between shows variance

**Entry / Exit Criteria**

- Conditions required to enter / exit from a phase
- Entry criterion - condition that must exist for work to start
- Exit criterion - accomplishments for the phase to be complete

**Dependency Determination**

- Mandatory dependencies
  - Hard logic
- Discretionary dependencies
  - Soft logic
- External dependencies
  - External constraint
- Internal dependencies
  - Type of hard logic

**Leads and Lags**

- Lead is accelerated time
- Lead allows activities to overlap
- Lag is waiting time
- Lag moves activities farther apart

**Creating Network Diagrams**

- Visualize the project work
- Show the relationship of the work activities
- Workflow of the project
- Activity-on-node

**Using Precedence Diagramming Method**

- Precedence diagramming method (PDM) is the most common
- Activities in boxes, called nodes, connect with arrows
- Arrows represent the relationship among work packages

**Identify Resources**

- People 
- Materials 
- Facilities
- Equipment

**Calendars in Project Management**

- Resource calendar
- Project calendar




**Resource Types**

- Shared resources: used for multiple projects
- Dedicated resources: committed for one project
- Benched resources: retained but not performing “billable” tasks
- Low-quality resources: no specialized skills or qualities

**Resource Breakdown Structure**

- Like a WBS
- Organize needed resource for project deliverables

**Estimate Activity Duration**

- Level of detail leads to accuracy
- Activity lists
- Activity resource requirements
- Activity attributes
- Resource capabilities
- Organizational process assets

**Creating Duration Estimates**

- Tasks are first identified
- Sequencing of the activities
- Resources defined
- Durations are estimated
- Four activities are iterated

**Estimating Duration Considerations**

- Law of diminishing returns
  - Increase in resources will eventually yield diminishing returns
- Number of resources
  - Adding resources doesn’t always reduce duration
  - May increase risk
  - Knowledge transfer
  - Learning curve
    - Advances in technology
    - Faster equipment
- Parkinson’s Law
  - Work will expand to the time allotted to it



**Included in Estimates**

- Range of variance
  - Range of +/- days or weeks
  - Percentage of acceptable target date completion
- Basis of estimates
  - Basis of the estimate
  - Assumptions made
  - Known constraints
  - Range of possible estimates
  - Confidence level of the final estimate
  - Risks influencing this estimate

**Analogous Estimating**

- Creates an analogy
- Similar project work
- Historical information
- Top-down estimating

**Analogous Estimating Considerations**

- Fastest and least expensive
- Least reliable estimating approach
- Historical information
- Reliable information
- Expert judgment

**Parametric Estimating**

- Parameter for estimating
- Repetitive work
- Learning curve
- Algorithm to calculate duration
  - Time per unit
  - Square footage
  - Historical data

**Duration and Effort**

- Duration is how long an activity takes
- Effort is the billable time for the labor



**Three-Point Estimates**

- Finds an average of:
  - Optimistic
  - Most likely
  - Pessimistic
  - Also called triangular distribution
- (O+ML+P)/3=Estimate

**PERT Estimates**

- Program Evaluation and Review Technique
- Also called beta distribution
- (O+(4ML)+P)/6=Estimate

**Bottom-Up Estimating**

- Usually associated with cost estimates
- Can use this for duration estimating
- Fully-decomposed WBS
- Estimate how many resources you’ll need to create each work package
- Each work package can have multiple activities associated
- Duration of each work package is estimated
- Most accurate
- Starting at bottom and working up to predict total duration

**Considering Reserve Analysis**

- Contingency and management reserve aka schedule reserves
- Account for schedule uncertainty
- Estimated duration for identified, accepted risks
- Associated with the known-unknowns
- Percentage of the estimated activity duration or a fixed number
- May be separated from the individual activities and aggregated
- Over time, contingency reserve may be reduced, or eliminated
- Contingency is identified in the schedule documentation








**Considering Management Reserves**

- Specified amount of the project budget
- Withheld for management control purposes
- Reserved for unforeseen work that is within scope of the project
- Address unknown-unknowns
- Not included in the schedule baseline
- Part of the overall project duration
- Contracts may require use of management reserves as a change to the schedule baseline
