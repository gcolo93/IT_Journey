**Section 10: Planning for Risk**

**What is ‘risk’?**

- Risk and reward
- Risk is not always bad
- Business risk
- Pure risk

**Planning for Risk Management**

- Risk appetite
- Risk tolerance
- Risk threshold
- Stakeholder tolerance
- Utility function

**Two Levels of Risk**

- Individual project risks
- Overall project risk
- Looking for risk exposure
  - Threats
  - Opportunities

**Effect-Based Risk Classification**

- How a risk can affect the project success
- Risk can affect:
  - Time
  - Cost
  - Quality
  - Scope

**Source-Based Risk Classification**

- Determining where risks have started
- Internal or external
- Technical and nontechnical
- Industry-specific or generic





**Business Risk vs. Insurable-Risk**

- A business risk is one that is inherent in a business endeavor
  - Profit or loss
  - Return on investment
- Insurable risk has only the potential for loss
  - Errors and omission insurance
  - Liability insurance

**Types of Uncertainty**

- Known
  - Can roughly predict the nature and extent of the effect
- Known-unknown
  - Could affect project objectives, but not able to predict how or how much
- Unknown-unknown
  - Items that are beyond an ability to foresee, predict, or prepare for

**Plan Risk Management**

- Define show risk management activities will occur
- Risk activities in relation to project importance
- Defines how the key stakeholders will:
  - Identify risks
  - Analyze risks
  - Create risk responses
  - Control risks

**Integrated Risk Management**

- Part of a program or portfolio
- Risks owned and managed at the appropriate level
- Some risks will be delegated to the project team
- Risks may be escalated to higher levels
- Enterprise-wide risk management
- Risk efficiency part of organization

**Risk Planning and Stakeholder Tolerance**

- Risk tolerance is the willing risk exposure by an organization
- Launch of the project
- Written policy statements
- Low tolerance and high risk exposure
- Risk appetite in hopes of the reward the risk will bring 
- Organization risk threshold is for Go / No Go decisions

**Risk Tolerance Among Stakeholders**

- Risk-averter
  - Not likely to take a risk that is considered a high risk
- Risk-neutral
  - Proportional to the amount of money at stake
- Risk-seeker
  - Accepts an uncertain outcome and may be willing to take a high risk regardless of the consequences

**Planning Meetings and Analysis**

- Project manager, project team, stakeholders
- Cost elements
- Schedule activities
- Risk management plan

**Creating the Risk Management Plan**

- Project manager
- Project team leaders
- Key stakeholders
- Personnel specific to risk management
- Persons of authority

**Risk Management Planning**

**Risk Categories**

- Risk Breakdown Structure
- Technical, quality, or performance risks
- Project management risks
- Organization risks
- External risks













**Risk Register Specifics**

- Risks: identification of the risks
- Potential responses: initial risk identification process possible solutions and responses to identified risks
- Triggers are warning signs
- Potential risk owners: person or role who will own the risk
- Additional data:
  - Risk category
  - Status
  - Root cause(s)
  - Triggers
  - WBS references
  - Timing
  - Deadlines

**Using the Delphi Technique**

- Anonymous method
- Survey results analyzed by a third party
- Several rounds of anonymous discussion
- Goal is to gain consensus on risks
- Fear of retribution

**Identifying Risks Through Interviews**

- Subject matter experts
- Project stakeholders
- Interviewees’ experience
- WBS and assumptions

**Ishikawa Diagrams**

- Cause-and-effect diagrams
- Fishbone diagrams
- Root-cause analysis
- Effect, not symptom

**Perform Qualitative Risk Analysis**

- Fast, subjective approach to analysis
- Quantify the risk for more analysis
- Can be done as risks are identified
- Cardinal or ordinal scale

**Perform Qualitative Risk Analysis**

- Prioritizing individual project risks for further analysis or action
- Assessment of probability of occurrence and impact
- Focuses efforts on high-priority risks
- Fast and quick

**Preparing for Risk Analysis**

- Qualitative risk analysis “qualifies” the risks
- Examines and prioritizes the risks based on probability
- Impact on the project
- Broad approach to ranking risks
- Facilitator aware of bias

**Qualitative Risk Analysis Considerations**

- Risk management plan is the key input
- Process, methodologies, and the scoring model
- The status of the project
- Early in the project
  - Number and type of risks
  - Time available for risk analysis
- Project type affects risk analysis
- Accuracy and source of risk data

**Assumptions Analysis and Stakeholders**

- Assumptions log
- Assumptions will be evaluated
- Stakeholder register serves as an input
- Certain stakeholders may be risk owners

**Risk Parameters Considerations**

- Urgency of the risk
  - How long before the risk may happen?
- Proximity
  - How long before the risk will affect a project objective?
- Dormancy
  - How long before its impact is noticed?
- Manageability
  - How easily can the risk be managed?
- Controllability
  - How easily can the outcome be controlled?

**Risk Parameters Considerations**

- Detectability
  - How easily can the risk’s occurrence be detected?
- Connectivity
  - How connected is a risk to other risks?
- Strategic impact
  - What size of impact will the risk have on strategic goals?
- Propinquity
  - What is the risk perception by key stakeholders?

**Outcome of Qualitative Risks**

- Imminent risks are usually higher urgency than distant risks
- Identifies risks that require additional analysis
- Identified risks may proceed directly to risk response planning
- Identifies not critical risk, but still documented

**Perform Quantitative Risk Analysis**

- Quantifying the identified risks
- Usually for the more serious risks
  - Probability
  - Impact
- Helps with risk response planning

**Goals of Quantitative Analysis**

- Identify the risks with largest impact
- Likelihood of reaching project success
- Likelihood of reaching a project objective
- Project’s risk exposure
- Contingency reserve
- Determine realistic time, cost, and scope targets

**Performing Quantitative Analysis**

- Interviewing stakeholders and experts
- Risk distributions
- Sensitivity analysis
- Expected Monetary Value
- Modeling and simulation
- Expert judgment


**Applying Sensitivity Analysis**

- Examines each project risk on its own merit
- Analysis process to determine which risks have greatest effect
- All other risks in the project are set at a baseline value
- Individual risk is then examined to see how it may affect the success
- Goal is to determine which individual risks have the greatest effect

**Using a Decision Tree**

- Which of two or more decisions is the best to make
  - Buy-versus-build scenarios
  - Lease-or-purchase equations
  - In-house resources rather than outsourcing

**Using a Project Simulation**

- Project simulations
- “What-if” games without affecting production

**Monte Carlo Analysis**

- Monte Carlo analysis technique
- Software program
- Simulates a project with values for all possible variables to predict the most likely model
- Monte Carlo simulations can create an S-curve, to show the likelihood of a desired outcome

**Applying Sensitivity Analysis**

- Examines each project risk on its own merit
- Analysis process to determine which risks have greatest effect
- All other risks in the project are set at a baseline value
- Individual risk is then examined to see how it may affect the success
- Goal is to determine which risks have greatest effect

**Finding the Expected Monetary Value**

- Based on the probability of outcomes that are uncertain
- A risk may cost an additional $10,000 if it occurs
- 20 percent chance of occurring
- Expected monetary value of $10,000 is $2000



**Probability-Impact Matrix**

- Cardinal scale
- Risk exposure
- Sum of contingency reserve
