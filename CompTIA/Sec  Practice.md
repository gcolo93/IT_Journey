**Lesson 1**

Which security related phrase relates to the integrity of data?

1. Integrity means that any data is stored and transferred as intended and that any modification is authorized. Integrity is part of the CIA triad.
1. Availability means that any information is accessible to those authorized to view or modify it. Availability is part of the CIA triad.
1. Confidentiality means that certain information should only be known to certain people. Confidentiality is part of the CIA triad.
1. Non-repudiation means that a subject cannot deny doing something, such as creating, modifying, or sending a resource. Having a witness to signing a legal document is an example.

An engineer looks to implement security measures by following the five functions in the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Cybersecurity Framework. When documenting the “detect” function, what does the engineer focus on?

1. Detect refers to performing ongoing proactive monitoring to ensure that controls are effective and capable of protecting against new types of threats.
1. Identify covers developing security policies and capabilities, and evaluating risks, threats, and vulnerabilities and recommend security controls to mitigate them.
1. Protect and procure covers the processes to install, operate, and decommission IT hardware and software assets with security as an embedded requirement of every stage of an operations life cycle.
1. Recovery deals with the implementation of cybersecurity resilience to restore systems and data if other controls are unable to prevent attacks.


How might the goals of a basic network management not be well-aligned with the goals of security?

1. Security is increasingly thought of as a dedicated function. The goals of a network manager are not always well-aligned with the goals of security; network management focuses on availability over confidentiality.
1. System security may be a dedicated business unit with its own management structure. As a result, network management might only concern itself with availability.
1. The goals of a basic network management are not always well-aligned with the goals of security; network management would not focus on confidentiality, but rather availability.
1. Network management would encompass the responsibility for systems up-time and availability. Security administrators would focus on integrity and confidentiality.

Any external responsibility for an organization’s security lies mainly with which individuals?

1. External responsibility for security (due care or liability) lies mainly with owners or senior executives. It is important to note that all employees share some measure of responsibility.
1. Technical and specialist staff have the direct responsibility for implementing, maintaining, and monitoring the policy. Security might be made a core competency of systems and network administrators, or there may be dedicated security administrators.
1. Managers at an organization may have responsibility for a specific domain or unit, such as building control, ICT, or accounting.
1. Non-technical staff have the responsibility of complying with policy and with any relevant legislation. Public relations is responsible for media communications.

The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) provides a framework that classifies security-related functions. Which description aligns with the "respond" function?

1. The identify function is to develop security policies and capabilities. This function is used to evaluate risks, threats, and vulnerabilities and recommend security controls to mitigate them.
1. The detect function is to perform ongoing, proactive monitoring to ensure that controls are effective and capable of protecting against new types of threats.
1. The recover function is to implement cybersecurity resilience to restore systems and data if other controls are unable to prevent attacks.
1. The respond function is to identify, analyze, contain, and eradicate threats to systems and data security.

A company has an annual contract with an outside firm to perform a security audit on their network. The purpose of the annual audit is to determine if the company is in compliance with their internal directives and policies for security control. Select the broad class of security control that accurately demonstrates the purpose of the audit.

1. Managerial is the control that gives oversight of the information system including selection of other security controls. An example of this type of control is regular scans and audits.
1. Technical control is implemented as a system (hardware, software, or firmware). For example, firewalls, antivirus software, and OS access control models are technical controls. Technical controls may also be described as logical controls.
1. Physical controls deter access to premises and hardware. Examples include alarms, gateways, and locks.
1. A compensating control serves as a substitute for a principal control, as recommended by a security standard, and affords the same (or better) level of protection but uses a different methodology or technology.

The \_\_\_\_\_ requires federal agencies to develop security policies for computer systems that process confidential information.

1. The Computer Security Act (1987) specifically requires federal agencies to develop security policies for computer systems that process confidential information.
1. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act (2002) mandates the implementation of risk assessments, internal controls and audit procedures. This act is not for any specific entity.
1. The Federal Information Security Management Act (2002) governs the security of data processed by federal government agencies. This act requires agencies to implement an information security program.
1. The Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (1999) is a United States federal law that requires financial institutions to explain how they share and protect their customers' private information.

After a poorly handled security breach, a company updates its security policy to include an improved incident response plan. Which of the following security controls does this update address?

1. An incident response plan is corrective. It responds to and fixes an incident. It may also prevent its recurrence.
1. Compensating is a security control that serves as a substitute for a principal control, as recommended by a security standard.
1. A deterrent is the control that may not physically or logically prevent access, but psychologically discourages an attacker from attempting an intrusion.
1. A detective is the control that may not prevent or deter access but will identify and record any attempted or successful intrusion.

The IT department head returns from an industry conference feeling inspired by a presentation on the topic of cybersecurity frameworks. A meeting is scheduled with IT staff to brainstorm ideas for deploying security controls by category and function throughout the organization. Which of the following ideas are consistent with industry definitions? **(Select all that apply.)**

1. A technical control is enforced by computer hardware and software, such as an access control list (ACL) configured on a network firewall.
1. Monitoring of risk and compliance is a type of managerial control, not an operational control. Operational controls are categorized as those performed by people, such as security guards.
1. A preventive control such as user education and training is one that eliminates or reduces the likelihood of an attack before it can take place.
1. A corrective control such as backup is used following an attack to eliminate or mitigate its impact.

Which of the following has a cyber security framework (CSF) that focuses exclusively on IT security, rather than IT service provisioning?

1. The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Cybersecurity Framework (CSF) is a relatively new addition to the IT governance space, and is distinct from other frameworks by focusing exclusively on IT security, rather than IT service provision more generally.
1. ISO develops standards and frameworks governing the use of computers, networks, and telecommunications, including ones for information security (27000 series). It is a commercial product.
1. COBIT is an IT governance framework with security as a core component. COBIT is published by ISACA and is also a commercial product, available through APMG International.
1. SABSA is a methodology for providing information assurance aligned to business needs and driven by risk analysis.





**Lesson 2**

A company technician goes on vacation. While the technician is away, a critical patch released for Windows servers is not applied. According to the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), what does the delay in applying the patch create on the server?

1. NIST defines vulnerability as a weakness that could be triggered accidentally or exploited intentionally to cause a security breach. In addition to delays in applying patches, other examples of vulnerabilities include improperly installed hardware, untested software, and inadequate physical security.
1. Control is a system or procedure put in place to mitigate a risk. An example of control is policies or network monitoring to identify unauthorized software.
1. Risk is the likelihood and impact of a threat actor exercising a vulnerability.
1. Threat is the potential for a threat agent to exercise a vulnerability.

When exploring the deep web, a user will need which of the following to find a specific and hidden dark web site?

1. Access to deep web sites, especially those hidden from search engines, are accessed via the website's URL. These are often only available via "word of mouth" bulletin boards.
1. The Onion Router (TOR) is software used to establish a network overlay to the Internet infrastructure to create the dark net. TOR, along with other software like Freenet or I2P, anonymizes the usage of the dark net.
1. A dark web search engine can be used to find dark web website collections, which constitute roughly 1% of the deep web. Some dark web websites have hidden IP addresses and cannot be found by search engines or require additional software to gain access to the site.
1. Open-source intelligence (OSINT) is cybersecurity-relevant information harvested from public websites and data records.


Which of the following is mostly considered an insider threat? **(Select all that apply.)**

1. Anyone who has or had authorized access to an organization’s network, system, or data is considered an insider threat. In this example, a former employee and a contractor fit the criteria.
1. Current employees, business partners, and contractors also qualify as insider threats.
1. A customer does not have authorized access and is unlikely to be affiliated with an organization’s staff.
1. A white hat hacker is given complete access to information about the network, which is useful for simulating the behavior of a privileged insider threat, but they are not an insider threat.

One aspect of threat modeling is to identify potential threat actors and the risks associated with each one. When assessing the risk that any one type of threat actor poses to an organization, what are the critical factors to profile? **(Select all that apply.)**

1. From the choices provided, the two most critical factors to profile for a threat actor are intent and motivation. Greed, curiosity, or grievance may motivate an attacker.
1. The intent could be to vandalize and disrupt a system or to steal something.
1. While education and socioeconomic traits could potentially be considered in a threat actor profile, they are inferior to intent and motivation.
1. Malicious intents and motivations can be contrasted with accidental or unintentional threat actors and agents. Unintentional threat actors represent accidents, oversights, and other mistakes. In this sense, training is crucial to ensuring employees are educated about security measures.

An unknowing user with authorized access to systems in a software development firm installs a seemingly harmless, yet unauthorized program on a workstation without the IT department's sanction. Identify the type of threat that is a result of this user's action.

1. Anyone who has or had authorized access to an organization’s network, system, or data is considered an insider threat. Installing unauthorized software is negligent, but the user is an unintentional attack vector.
1. A malicious insider intentionally exceeds or misuses his or her access for purposes of sabotage, financial gain, or business advancement.
1. An attack vector is the path through which a threat actor gains access to a secure system; in this case, the path is through an employee's negligent software installation, which in all likelihood is not intentional.
1. An external threat with insider knowledge usually refers to former insiders, such as ex-employees now working at another company or who have been dismissed and now harbor a grievance. This is not the case with this situation.

A contractor has been hired to conduct security reconnaissance on a company. The contractor browses the company's website to identify employees and then finds their Facebook pages. Posts found on Facebook indicate a favorite bar that employees frequent. The contractor visits the bar and learns details of the company's security infrastructure through small talk. What reconnaissance phase techniques does the contractor practice? **(Select all that apply.)**

1. OSINT refers to using web search tools and social media to obtain information about the target. The contractor used this technique by identifying employees and the local restaurant they go to after work.
1. Social engineering was used at the restaurant by learning about the vacant positions and the shortfall in information security. This could be successful due to the attacker being charismatic and also social norms of people wanting to be friendly. The scenario also mentioned it was the popular location for after work drinks, meaning that alcohol was also likely involved.
1. Scanning would be conducted if the contractor used software tools to obtain the information.
1. Persistence refers to the tester's ability to reconnect to a compromised host.

What is Open Source Intelligence (OSINT)?

1. OSINT is using web search tools and social media to obtain information about the target. It requires almost no privileged access as it relies on finding information that the company makes publicly available, whether intentionally or not.
1. Obtaining information, physical access to premises, or access to a user account through the art of persuasion is social engineering.
1. The means the organization will take to protect the confidentiality, availability, and integrity of sensitive data and resources is considered a security policy.
1. Using software tools to obtain information about a host or network topology is considered scanning.

A security engineer investigates a recent system breach. When compiling a report of the incident, how does the engineer classify the actor and the vector?

1. A threat is the potential for something to exploit a vulnerability. The thing that poses the threat is called an actor, while the path used can be referred to as the vector.
1. A vulnerability is a weakness that could be triggered accidentally or exploited intentionally to cause a security breach.
1. Risk is the likelihood and impact (or consequence) of a threat actor exploiting a vulnerability.
1. An exploit is a method that is used to expose and compromise a vulnerability.

An IT manager in the aviation sector checks the industry's threat intelligence feed to keep up on the latest threats and ensure the work center implements the best practices in the field. What type of threat intelligence source is the IT manager most likely accessing?

1. ISACs are set up to share industry-specific threat intelligence and best practices in critical sectors, such as the aviation industry.
1. OSINT includes any publicly available intelligence, in addition to threat intelligence services companies operate on an open source basis.
1. Vendors often post proprietary intelligence on their websites and blogs, free of cost, as a general benefit to their consumers.
1. Proprietary or closed threat intelligence platforms operate on a paid subscription basis. The security solution provider will also make the most valuable research available early to platform subscribers in the form of blogs, white papers, and webinars.

A Department of Defense (DoD) security team identifies a data breach in progress, based on some anomalous log entries, and take steps to remedy the breach and harden their systems. When they resolve the breach, they want to publish the cyber threat intelligence (CTI) securely, using standardized language for other government agencies to use. The team will transmit threat data feed via which protocol?

1. The TAXII protocol provides a means for transmitting CTI data between servers and clients. Subscribers to the CTI service obtain updates to the data to load into analysis tools over TAXII.
1. While STIX provides the syntax for describing CTI, the TAXII protocol transmits CTI data between servers and clients.
1. The Department of Homeland Security's (DHS) Automated Indicator Sharing (AIS) is especially aimed at Information Sharing and Analysis Centers (ISACs), but private companies can join too. AIS is based on the STIX and TAXII standards and protocols.
1. A file/code repository holds signatures of known malware code.









**Lesson 3**

Identify the command that can be used to detect the presence of a host on a particular IP address.

1. The ping command can be used to detect the presence of a host on a particular IP address or that responds to a particular host name. This command is a fast and easy way to determine if a system can communicate over the network with another system.
1. The ipconfig command is used to report the configuration assigned to the network adapter in Windows.
1. The ifconfig command can be used to report the adapter configuration in Linux.
1. The ip command is a more powerful command in Linux and gives options for managing routes as well as the local interface configuration.

A network manager needs a map of the network's topology. The network manager is using Network Mapper (Nmap) and will obtain the visual map with the Zenmap tool. If the target IP address is 192.168.1.1, determine the command within Nmap that will return the necessary data to build the visual map of the network topology.

1. The traceroute command is used to probe a path from one end system to another, and lists the intermediate systems providing the link. The Nmap combined with Zenmap tools will give a visual of the network topology.
1. The ipconfig and ifconfig commands are used for looking at the configuration of a system's network adapter.
1. The primary difference between the ipconfig and ifconfig commands are the type of systems the network is using. The ipconfig is designed for Windows, while the ifconfig is designed for use on Linux systems.
1. The nslookup command is used to query the Domain Name System (DNS).




A system administrator must scan the company’s web-based application to identify which ports are open and which operating system can be seen from the outside world. Determine the syntax that should be used to yield the desired information if the administrator will be executing this task from a Linux command line.

1. The correct syntax is nmap -O webapp.company.com. When the -O switch is used with nmap, it displays open ports and running software, but does not show the version.
1. The netstat command checks the state of ports on the local machine. In Linux, the -a switch displays ports in the listening state, it does not enable software and version detection.
1. Using nmap -sS 10.1.0.0/24 is a fast technique also referred to as half-open scanning, as the scanning host requests a connection without acknowledging it. 
1. Netstat shows the state of TCP/UDP ports on the local machine. Netstat -n suppresses name resolution, so host IP addresses and numeric ports are shown in the output.

Select the appropriate methods for packet capture. **(Select all that apply.)**

1. Wireshark and tcdump are packet sniffers. A sniffer is a tool that captures packets, or frames, moving over a network.
1. Wireshark is an open source graphical packet capture and analysis utility. Wireshark works with most operating systems, where tcpdump is a command line packet capture utility for Linux.
1. A packet analyzer works in conjunction with a sniffer to perform traffic analysis. Protocol analyzers can decode a captured frame to reveal its contents in a readable format, but they do not capture packets.
1. A packet injection involves sending forged or spoofed network traffic by inserting (or injecting) frames into the network stream. Packets are not captured with packet injection.



Analyze and eliminate the item that is NOT an example of a reconnaissance technique.

1. The initial exploitation phase (also referred to as weaponization) is not a reconnaissance technique. It is an exploit that is used to gain some sort of access to the target's network.
1. Open Source Intelligence (OSINT) refers to using web search tools and social media to obtain information about the target.
1. Social engineering refers to obtaining information, physical access to premises, or even access to a user account through the art of persuasion.
1. Scanning refers to using software tools to obtain information about a host or network topology. Scans may be launched against web hosts or against wired or wireless network segments, if the attacker can gain physical access to them.

Select the statement which best describes the difference between a zero-day vulnerability and a legacy platform vulnerability.

1. A zero-day vulnerability is exploited before the developer knows about it or can release a patch. These can be extremely destructive, as it can take the vendor some time to develop a patch, leaving systems vulnerable in the interim.
1. A legacy platform is no longer supported with security patches by its developer or vendor. By definition, legacy platforms are not patchable.
1. Legacy systems are highly likely to be vulnerable to exploits and must be protected by security controls other than patching, such as isolating them to networks that an attacker cannot physically connect to.
1. Even if effective patch management procedures are in place, attackers may still be able to use zero-day software vulnerabilities, before a vendor develops a patch.






Examine each attack vector. Which is most vulnerable to escalation of privileges?

1. A vulnerability in an OS kernel file or shared library can allow privilege escalation, where the malware code runs with higher access rights (system or root). Root or system accounts are considered superuser accounts with administrative privileges.
1. Software exploitation means an attack that targets a vulnerability in software code.
1. An application vulnerability is a design flaw that can cause the security system to be circumvented or that will cause the application to crash.
1. Security best practice for network configurations dictates that open ports should be restricted to only necessary services. Running unnecessary open ports and services increases the attack surface.

An outside security consultant updates a company’s network, including data cloud storage solutions. The consultant leaves the manufacturer’s default settings when installing network switches, assuming the vendor shipped the switches in a default-secure configuration. Examine the company’s network security posture and select the statements that describe key vulnerabilities in this network. **(Select all that apply.)**

1. Weaknesses in products or services in a supply chain can impact service availability and performance, or lead to data breaches. Suppliers and vendors in the chain rely on each other to perform due diligence.
1. Relying on the manufacturer default settings when deploying an appliance or software applications is a weak configuration. Although many vendors ship products in secure default configurations, it is insufficient to rely on default settings.
1. Default settings may leave unsecure interfaces enabled that allow an attacker to compromise the device. Weak settings on network appliances can allow attackers to move through the network unhindered and snoop on traffic.
1. An unsecure protocol transfers data as cleartext. It does not use encryption for data protection.

Encryption vulnerabilities allow unauthorized access to protected data. Which component is subject to brute-force enumeration?

1. An unsecured protocol is one that transfers data as cleartext—that is, the protocol does not use encryption for data protection.
1. Software vulnerabilities affect all types of code. Operating system and firmware vulnerabilities may allow escalated permissions and unauthorized access. Software and security researchers discover most vulnerabilities and release patches to remedy them.
1. Weak encryption vulnerabilities allow unauthorized access to data. An algorithm or cipher used for encryption has known weaknesses that allow brute-force enumeration.
1. If a decryption key is not distributed securely, it can easily fall into the hands of people who are not authorized to decrypt the data.

Following a data breach at a large retail company, their public relations team issues a statement emphasizing the company’s commitment to consumer privacy. Identify the true statements concerning this event. **(Select all that apply.)**

1. A privacy breach may allow the threat actor to perform identity theft or to sell the data to other malicious actors. Malicious actors may obtain account credentials or use personal details and financial information to make fraudulent credit applications and purchases.
1. A data breach can cause a data exfiltration event to occur. A data exfiltration event is always intentional and malicious.
1. A data breach event is where confidential data is read or transferred without authorization. A data breach, unlike data exfiltration, can be intentional/malicious or unintentional/accidental.
1. Availability means that information is accessible to those authorized to view or modify it. If a data breach brings down processing systems, a company may not be able to perform crucial workflows like order processing and fulfillment, compromising information availability.

Compare and contrast vulnerability scanning and penetration testing. Select the true statement from the following options.

1. Vulnerability scanning and penetration testing can use passive or active reconnaissance techniques. A passive approach tries to discover issues without causing an impact to systems, whereas an active approach may cause instability on a scanned system.
1. Penetration testing is non-malicious; therefore, it is a “white hat” activity, not “black hat.”
1. Penetration testing is considered “ethical hacking,” but vulnerability scanning is not. Vulnerability scanning is used to uncover system weaknesses, not to try to hack into the system.
1. Both vulnerability scanning and penetration testing are forms of reconnaissance, or information gathering. The hacker likely has to find some way of escalating the privileges available to them.

An IT director reads about a new form of malware that targets a system widely utilized in the company’s network. The director wants to discover whether the network has been targeted, but also wants to conduct the scan without disrupting company operations or tipping off potential attackers to the investigation. Evaluate vulnerability scanning techniques and determine the best tool for the investigation.

1. Where a pen test attempts to demonstrate a system’s weakness or achieve intrusion, threat hunting is based only on analysis of data within the system. It is potentially less disruptive than pen testing.
1. A credentialed scan has a user account with logon rights to hosts and permissions appropriate for the testing routines. Credentialed scans are intrusive and allow in-depth analysis and insight to what an insider attack might achieve.
1. A configuration review assesses the configuration of security controls and application settings & permissions compared to established benchmarks.
1. Penetration testing, an intrusive, active scanning technique, does not stop at detection, but attempts to gain access to a system.

A network administrator uses two different automated vulnerability scanners. They regularly update with the latest vulnerability feeds. If the system regularly performs active scans, what type of error is the system most likely to make?

1. A false positive is something that is identified by a scanner or other assessment tool as being a vulnerability, when in fact it is not.
1. False negatives are potential vulnerabilities that are not identified in a scan. This risk can be mitigated somewhat by running repeat scans periodically and by using scanners from more than one vendor.
1. Reviewing related system and network logs can enhance the vulnerability report validation process. Using relevant data, such as event logs, can help confirm the validity of vulnerabilities identified in a scan.
1. Some scanners measure systems and configuration settings against best practice frameworks. This is called a compliance scan, which might be necessary for regulatory compliance or voluntary conformance.

Which of the following statements summarizes a disadvantage to performing an active vulnerability scan? **(Select all that apply.)**

1. Scan intrusiveness is a measure of how much the scanner interacts with the target. Active scanning consumes more network bandwidth than passive scanning.
1. Active scanning means probing the device's configuration using some type of network connection with the target. This type of scanning runs the risk of crashing the target of the scan or causing some other sort of outage.
1. Active scanning has the possibility of failing due to any security settings that may prevent certain scans.
1. A non-credentialed scan proceeds by directing test packets at a host without being able to log on to the OS or application. A non-credentialed scan provides a view of what the host exposes to an unprivileged user on the network.

In which of these situations might a non-credentialed vulnerability scan be more advantageous than a credentialed scan? **(Select all that apply.)**

1. Non-credentialed scanning is often the most appropriate technique for external assessment of the network perimeter or when performing web application scanning.
1. A non-credentialed scan proceeds by directing test packets at a host without being able to log on to the OS or application. A non-credentialed scan provides a view of what the host exposes to an unprivileged user on the network.
1. A passive scan has the least impact on the network and on hosts but is less likely to identify vulnerabilities comprehensively.
1. Configuration reviews investigate how system misconfigurations make controls less effective or ineffective, such as antivirus software not being updated, or management passwords left configured to the default. Configuration reviews generally require a credentialed scan.

A contractor has been hired to conduct penetration testing on a company's network. They have decided to try to crack the passwords on a percentage of systems within the company. They plan to annotate the type of data that is on the systems that they can successfully crack to prove the ease of access to data. Evaluate the penetration steps and determine which are being utilized for this task. **(Select all that apply.)**

1. Two penetration test steps are being utilized by actively testing security controls and exploiting the vulnerabilities. Identifying weak passwords is actively testing security controls.
1. In addition, exploiting vulnerabilities is being used by proving that a vulnerability is high risk. The list of critical data obtained will prove that the weak passwords can allow access to critical information.
1. Bypassing security controls can be accomplished by going around controls that are already in place to gain access.
1. Verifying that a threat exists would have consisted of using surveillance, social engineering, network scanners, and/or vulnerability assessment tools to identify vulnerabilities.

A manufacturing company hires a pentesting firm to uncover any vulnerabilities in their network with the understanding that the pen tester receives no information about the company’s system. Which of the following penetration testing strategies is the manufacturing company requesting?

1. Black box (or blind) is when the pen tester receives no privileged information about the network and its security systems. Black box tests are useful for simulating the behavior of an external threat.
1. A sandbox is a test environment that accurately simulates a production environment. It is not a penetration testing strategy.
1. Gray box describes the penetration strategy where the pen tester receives some information. Typically, this would resemble the knowledge of junior or non-IT staff to model particular types of insider threats.
1. White box (or full disclosure) is when the pen tester receives complete access to information about the network. White box tests are useful for simulating the behavior of a privileged insider threat.

A hacker set up a Command and Control network to control a compromised host. What is the ability of the hacker to use this remote connection method as needed known as?

1. Persistence refers to the hacker’s ability to reconnect to the compromised host and use it as a Remote Access Tool (RAT) or backdoor. To do this, the hacker must establish a Command and Control (C2 or C&C) network.
1. Weaponization is an exploit used to gain some sort of access to a target's network, but it doesn't involve being able to reconnect.
1. Reconnaissance is the process of gathering information, it is not related to Command and Control networks.
1. Pivoting follows persistence. It involves a system and/or set of privileges that allow the hacker to compromise other network systems (lateral spread). The hacker likely has to find some way of escalating the privileges available to him/her.

Which statement best explains the differences between black box, white box, and gray box attack profiles used in penetration testing?

1. A black box penetration tester receives no privileged information, while a white box tester has complete access. A white box test may follow up on a black box test.
1. In a black box pen test, the consultant receives no privileged information about the network and its security systems. A gray box pen tester has partial access and must perform some reconnaissance.
1. A red team performs an offensive role to try to infiltrate the target. A blue team defends a target system by operating monitoring and alerting controls to detect and prevent the infiltration.
1. White box tests are useful for simulating the behavior of a privileged insider threat. Gray box tests are useful for simulating the behavior of an unprivileged insider threat.

During a penetration test, systems administrators for a large company are tasked to play on the white team for an affiliated company. Examine each of the following roles and determine which role the systems admins will fill.

1. A white team sets the rules of engagement and monitors the exercise, providing arbitration and guidance, and if necessary, halt the exercise. If the red team is third party, the white team will include a representative of the consultancy company.
1. The red team acts offensively to try to infiltrate the target system.
1. The blue team performs the defensive role by operating monitoring and alerting controls to detect and prevent the infiltration.
1. The confrontational structure in a typical red team/blue team test does not always promote constructive development and improvement. In a purple team exercise, the red and blue teams meet for regular debriefs while the exercise is ongoing.















**Lesson 4**

A system administrator has just entered their credentials to enter a secure server room. As the administrator is entering the door, someone is walking up to the door with their hands full of equipment and appears to be struggling to move items around while searching for their credentials. The system administrator quickly begins to assist by getting items out of the person's hands, and they walk into the room together. This person is not an employee, but someone attempting to gain unauthorized access to the server room. What type of social engineering has occurred?

1. Consensus/social proof revolves around the belief that without an explicit instruction to behave in a certain way, people will follow social norms. It is typically polite to assist someone with their hands full.
1. Familiarity/Liking is when an attacker uses charisma to persuade others to do as requested. They downplay their requests to make it seem like their request is not out of the ordinary.
1. Authority and Intimidation can be used by an attacker by pretending to be someone senior. The person receiving the request would feel the need to take action quickly and without questioning the attacker.
1. Identity fraud is a specific type of impersonation where the attacker uses specific details (such as personal information) of someone's identity.

Before leaving for lunch, an employee receives a phone call, but there is no one on the line. Distracted by the odd interruption, the employee forgets to log out of the computer. Earlier that day, a person from the building across the street watched the employee entering login credentials using high-powered binoculars. Which form of social engineering is being used in this situation?

1. Shoulder surfing is stealing a password by watching the user type it. Although the attacker was not looking over the employee’s shoulder, the login credentials were obtained through observation.
1. Vishing is a phishing attack conducted through a voice channel. With no clue about the nature of the call received by the employee, it cannot be assumed to be part of an attack and would not be the best answer.
1. While a lunchtime attack involves leaving a workstation unattended, it does not involve obtaining a password. Rather, physical access to the system is gained through a logged-in computer.
1. A man-in-the-middle attack occurs when an attacker sits between two communicating hosts to intercept information. It is not social engineering.

Which of the following depict ways a malicious attacker can gain access to a target's network? **(Select all that apply.)**

1. Phishing and shoulder surfing are social engineering attacks. Phishing occurs when an attacker sends a legitimate-looking, spoofed email to a user of the spoofed site to trick the user into revealing private information.
1. Shoulder surfing is used to obtain someone’s password or PIN by observing a user typing it on the keyboard. Social engineering is malicious behavior meant to get users to reveal confidential information.
1. Ethical hacking is trying to identify weaknesses in a network. It is done with permission and is not malicious in intent.
1. An influence campaign is a program launched by an adversary with a high level of capability. The goal of an influence campaign is to shift public opinion on some topic.

Analyze the following attacks to determine which best illustrates a pharming attack.

1. Pharming is a means of redirecting users from a legitimate website to a malicious one that relies on corrupting the way the victim's computer performs IP address resolution. This is illustrated in the bank customer scenario.
1. Phishing is a type of email-based social engineering attack, in which the attacker sends email from a supposedly reputable source to try to elicit private information from the victim. This is exhibited in the insurance customer scenario.
1. Vishing is a phishing attack conducted through a voice channel. This is seen in the IT department scenario.
1. A watering hole attack relies on the circumstance that a group of targets may use an unsecure third-party website. This is shown in the sales department scenario.

An individual receives a text message that appears to be a warning from a well-known order fulfillment company, informing them that the carrier has tried to deliver his package twice, and that if the individual does not contact them to claim it, the package will not be delivered. Analyze the scenario and select the social engineering technique being used.

1. SMiShing attempts use short message service (SMS) text communications as the vector.
1. Phishing is a combination of social engineering and spoofing. It persuades or tricks the target into interacting with a malicious resource disguised as a trusted one, traditionally using email as the vector.

1. Prepending can make a phishing or hoax email more convincing. Used offensively, prepending means adding text that appears to have been generated by the mail system.

Which situation would require keyboard encryption software be installed on a computer?

1. Keyboard encryption software is used to protect against keyloggers, which record keystrokes for the purpose of stealing data. Keyloggers are spyware.
1. Single sign-on is a technology that enables a user to authenticate once and receive authorizations for multiple services. It does not require keyboard encryption.
1. Input validation involves limiting the type of data a user can enter into specific fields, such as not allowing special characters in a user name field. Encryption is not a concern.
1. Key management is the process of administering cryptographic keys and is performed by a Certificate Authority. It is not applicable to keyboard encryption.

A gaming company decides to add software on each title it releases. The company's objective is to require the CD to be inserted during use. This software will gain administrative rights, change system files, and may hide from detection without the knowledge or consent of the user. Consider the malware characteristics and determine which may be used.  (Select all that apply)

1. A rootkit is characterized by its ability to hide itself by changing core system files and programming interfaces and to escalate privileges. The gaming company accomplished this.
1. Trojans cannot conceal their presence entirely and will surface as a running process or service. While a rootkit is a type of Trojan or spyware, it differs in its ability to hide itself.
1. Spyware monitors user activity and may be installed with or without the user's knowledge, but it cannot gain administrative privileges or hide itself.

1. Keyloggers actively attempt to steal confidential information by recording the keystrokes of a user.
1. Key management is the process of administering cryptographic keys and managing their usage, storage, expiration, renewal, revocation, recovery, and escrow. It does not describe something that a hacker would install.
1. Encryption is a way of encoding data into ciphertext, which is unreadable unless it is decoded. Keyloggers are only interested in recording keystrokes, not decrypting data.
1. Obfuscation is a technique that essentially "hides" or "camouflages" code or other information so that it is harder to read by unauthorized users. Keyloggers do not want to hide anything, they want to steal useful information by capturing keystrokes.

An employee calls IT personnel and states that they received an email with a PDF document to review. After the PDF was opened, the system has not been performing correctly. An IT admin conducted a scan and found a virus. Determine the two classes of viruses the computer most likely has. **(Select all that apply.)**

1. Both a program and script virus can use a PDF as a vector. The user stated that a PDF file was recently opened. A program virus is executed when an application is executed. Executable objects can also be embedded or attached within other file types such as Microsoft Word and Rich Text Format.
1. A script virus typically targets vulnerabilities in an interpreter. Scripts are powerful languages used to automate operating system functions and add interactivity to web pages and are executed by an interpreter rather than self-executing. PDF documents have become a popular vector for script viruses.
1. A boot sector virus is one that attacks the disk boot sector information, the partition table, and sometimes the file system.
1. A trojan is a type of virus that infiltrates a system and creates a vector for other viruses or attackers to get into the system.













**Lesson 5**

Which of the following is NOT a use of cryptography?

1. Security through obscurity involves keeping something a secret by hiding it. With cryptography, messages do not need to be hidden since they are not understandable unless decrypted.
1. Non-repudiation is when the sender cannot deny sending the message. If the message has been encrypted in a way known only to the sender, logic follows the sender must have composed it.
1. Obfuscation is the art of making a message difficult to understand. Cryptography is a very effective way of obfuscating a message by encrypting it.
1. Resiliency occurs when the compromise of a small part of the system is prevented from allowing compromise of the whole system. Cryptography ensures the authentication and integrity of messages delivered over the control system.

Evaluate the differences between stream and block ciphers and select the true statement.

1. In a block cipher, if there is not enough data in the plaintext, it's padded to the correct size. Padding is not an issue with streaming, where each byte or bit of data in the plaintext is encrypted one at a time, but it is problematic in dealing with block size.
1. A block cipher is not suitable to communications, but a stream cipher is, since each byte or bit of data in the plaintext is encrypted one at a time.

1. Counter Mode (CTM) combines each block with a counter value. This allows each block to be processed individually and in parallel, improving performance.
1. Electronic Code Book (ECB) mode applies the same key to each plaintext block, which means identical plaintext blocks can output identical ciphertexts. This is not how a stream cipher behaves.
1. Counter Mode (CTM) allows block ciphers to behave like stream ciphers, which are faster than block ciphers.
1. Cipher Block Chaining (CBC) mode applies an Initialization Vector (IV) to the first plaintext block to ensure that the key produces a unique ciphertext from any given plaintext and repeating as a “chain.” This is not how a stream cipher behaves.

An employee works on a small team that shares critical information about the company's network. When sending emails that have this information, what would be used to provide the identity of the sender and prove that the information has not been tampered with?

1. A digital signature proves the identity of the sender of a message and to show that a message has not been tampered with since the sender posted it. This provides authentication, integrity, and non-repudiation.
1. A private key will encrypt the message. Encrypting the message will scramble the data to protect it during transmission.
1. The public key is what the recipient will use to decrypt the message. The decryption will allow the recipient to read the data upon receipt.
1. An RSA Algorithm is what many of the public key cryptography products are based on.

Which of the following utilizes both symmetric and asymmetric encryption?

1. A digital envelope is a type of key exchange system that utilizes symmetric encryption for speed and asymmetric encryption for convenience and security.
1. A digital certificate is an electronic document that associates credentials with a public key. This only involves asymmetric encryption.

1. A digital signature is a message digest encrypted with a user's private key. It uses only asymmetric encryption to prove the identity of the sender of a message and to show a message has not been tampered with.

When using a digital envelope to exchange key information, the use of what key agreement mitigates the risk inherent in the Rivest–Shamir–Adleman (RSA) algorithm, and by what means?

1. Perfect forward secrecy (PFS) mitigates the risk from RSA key exchange, using Diffie-Hellman (DH) key agreement to create ephemeral session keys without using the server's private key.
1. Modes of operation refer to AES use in a cipher suite. Cipher Block Chaining (CBC) mode applies an initialization vector (IV) to a chain of plaintext data and uses padding to fill out blocks of data.
1. Counter mode makes the AES algorithm work as a stream cipher. Each block of data can be processed individually and in parallel, improving performance.
1. A certificate authority (CA), validates the owner of a public key, issuing a signed certificate. The process of issuing and verifying certificates is called public key infrastructure (PKI).

Which two cryptographic functions can be combined to authenticate a sender and prove the integrity of a message?

1. Public key cryptography (public and private keys) can be used to authenticate a sender. Combine this with a hash output of the message and a secret (or private) key to create a message authentication code (MAC) to validate the integrity of the message.
1. A key exchange system known as a digital envelope or hybrid encryption combines the bulk encryption capabilities of symmetric encryption with the authentication capability of public key cryptography.
1. Asymmetric encryption is also called public key cryptography. A digital envelope allows the sender and recipient to exchange a symmetric encryption key securely by using public key cryptography.
1. Hashing proves integrity by computing a unique checksum from input. Digital envelope is another term for the hybrid encryption that combines public key encryption and symmetric encryption.

A system administrator downloads and installs software from a vendor website. Soon after installing the software, the administrator’s computer is taken over remotely. After closer investigation, the software package was modified, probably while it was downloading. What action could have prevented this incident from occurring?

1. The administrator should have validated the software with a checksum, which uses a cryptographic algorithm to generate a unique hash value based on the file contents. If the file is changed, the checksum of the modified file will not match the original.
1. A private certificate does not validate software.
1. A key signing key is associated with Domain Name System Security Extensions (DNSSEC), which validates DNS responses to help mitigate spoofing and poisoning attacks. It does not apply to software.
1. Kerberos is an authentication service based on a time-sensitive ticket-granting system. It is used to validate users, not software.

A security team is in the process of selecting a cryptographic suite for their company. Analyze cryptographic implementations and determine which of the following performance factors is most critical to this selection process if users primarily access systems on mobile devices.

1. Some technologies or ciphers configured with longer keys require more processing cycles and memory space, which makes them slower and consume more power. This makes them unsuitable for handheld devices and embedded systems that work on battery power.
1. Speed is most impactful when processing large amounts of data.
1. For some use cases, the time required to obtain a result is more important than a data rate. Latency issues may negatively affect performance when an operation or application times out before the authentication handshake.
1. Cost issues may arise in any decision-making process, but for mobile device cryptography, computing overhead is a primary limiting factor.

Which statement best illustrates the importance of a strong true random number generator (TRNG) or pseudo-random number generator (PRNG) in a cryptographic implementation?

1. A cryptanalyst can test for the presence of common factors and derive the whole key much more easily. The TRNG or PRNG module in the cryptographic implementation is critical to its strength.
1. Predictability is a weakness in either the cipher operation or within particular key values that make a ciphertext more vulnerable to cryptanalysis. Reuse of the same key within the same session can cause this weakness.
1. The principal characteristic of a nonce is that it is never reused ("number used once") within the same key value. A nonce can be a random, pseudo-random, or counter value.
1. Salt is a random or pseudo-random number or string. The term salt is used specifically in conjunction with hashing password values.

An attacker uses a cryptographic technology to create a covert message channel in transmission control protocol (TCP) packet data fields. What cryptographic technique does this attack strategy employ?

1. Steganography obscures the presence of a message and can be used to encode messages within TCP packet data fields to create a covert message channel for data exfiltration.
1. Homomorphic encryption is used to share privacy-sensitive data sets. It allows a recipient to perform statistical calculations on data fields while keeping the data set as a whole encrypted.
1. Blockchain uses cryptography to secure an expanding list of transactional records. Each record, or block, goes through a hash function. Each block’s hash value links to the hash value of the previous block.

Which statement most accurately describes the mechanisms by which blockchain ensures information integrity and availability?

1. The blockchain ledger is decentralized and distributed across a peer-to-peer (P2P) network to mitigate the risks of a single point of failure or compromise. Each block in a blockchain validates the hash of the previous block, all the way through to the beginning of the chain, ensuring that each historical transaction has not been tampered with.
1. Blockchain is open. It may ensure the integrity and transparency of financial transactions, among other potential applications.
1. Each block typically includes a timestamp of transactions, as well as the data involved in the transactions themselves, helping ensure data integrity.
1. One of the most important characteristics of a blockchain is decentralization. Being distributed across a peer-to-peer (P2P) network, blockchain users can trust each other equally.

1. Perfect forward security (PFS) mitigates the risks from RSA key exchanges through the use of ephemeral session keys to maintain confidentiality.

During a penetration test, an adversary operator sends an encrypted message embedded in an attached image. Analyze the scenario to determine what security principles the operator is relying on to hide the message. **(Select all that apply.)**

1. When used to conceal information, steganography amounts to "security by obscurity," which is usually deprecated.
1. A message can be encrypted by some mechanism before embedding it in a covertext, providing confidentiality.
1. Steganography technology can also provide integrity or non-repudiation; for example, it can show that something was printed on a particular device at a particular time, which could demonstrate that it was genuine or a fake.
1. A phishing or hoax email can be made more convincing by using prepending. In an offensive sense, prepending means adding text that appears legitimate and to have been generated by the mail system such as "MAILSAFE:PASSED."

**Lesson 6**

Consider the life cycle of an encryption key. Which of the following is NOT a stage in a key's life cycle?

1. Verification is not a stage in a key’s life cycle. It is part of the software development life cycle. The stages are: key generation, certificate generation, storage, revocation, and expiration and renewal.
1. Storage is the stage where a user must take steps to store the private key securely. It is also important to ensure that the private key is not lost or damaged.
1. The expiration and renewal stage addresses that a key pair expires after a certain period. Giving the key a "shelf-life" increases security. Certificates can be renewed with new key material.
1. Revocation is the stage that concerns itself with the event of a private key being compromised; it can be revoked before it expires.

A web administrator visits a website after installing its certificate to test the SSL binding. The administrator's client computer did not trust the website's certificate. The administrator views the website's certificate from the browser to determine which certificate authority (CA) generated the certificate. Which certificate field would assist with the troubleshooting process? 

1. The Issuer field provides the name of the certificate authority (CA) that generated and issued the certificate for the web server.
1. The subject alternative name (SAN) displays the extension field to identify the domain name system (DNS) name or names by which a host is identified.
1. The Signature algorithm field displays the algorithm used by the certificate authority to sign the certificate.
1. The Subject field displays the name of the certificate holder, expressed as a distinguished name (DN). The common name (CN) in this part would match the fully qualified domain name (FQDN) of the server or a user email address.

An employee has requested a digital certificate for a user to access the Virtual Private Network (VPN). It is discovered that the certificate is also being used for digitally signing emails. Evaluate the possible extension attributes to determine which should be modified so that the certificate only works for VPN access.

1. Set the Extended Key Usage (EKU) field of a certificate to define its usage. Applications such as virtual private network (VPN) or email clients may require specific requirements for key usage configuration.
1. The validity field displays the date and time during which the certificate is valid. Certificates are issued with a limited duration, as set by the certificate authority (CA) policy for the certificate type.
1. The serial number is a number uniquely identifying the certificate within the domain of its CA. This prevents a CA from generating duplicate certificates. 
1. The public key field displays the public key and algorithm used by the certificate holder. This key can be shared with other clients and users on the public network.

A website with many subdomains has been issued a web server certificate for domain validation. This certificate verifies the parent domain and subdomains (to a single level). This certificate is also known as which of the following?

1. A wildcard certificate with a field entry of a wildcard domain such as \*.comptia.org, means that the certificate issued to the parent domain will be accepted as valid for all subdomains (to a single level).
1. A subject alternative name (SAN) certificate list different identifiers including domain names which are specific for each certificate. This becomes a wildcard certificate when a wildcard domain is listed.
1. The root certificate is the one that identifies the certificate authority (CA) itself. The root certificate is self-signed. A root certificate would normally use a key size of at least 2048 bits.
1. A code signing certificate is issued to a software publisher by the CA. The publisher signs the executables or DLLs to guarantee the validity of a software application or browser plug-in.

Digital certificates are based on the X.509 standard that defines the fields (or information) about a subject (or entity using the certificate) and the certificate’s issuer. Which of the following fields would not be included in a standard public certificate?

1. An endorsement key is not required for a digital certificate. It is part of a Trusted Platform Module (TPM) and used to create subkeys for key storage, signature, and encryption operations.
1. The Extensions field defines which extended attributes a certificate supports. V3 certificates can be defined with extended attributes, such as friendly subject or issuer names, contact email addresses, and intended key usage.
1. The Public key field denotes the public key and algorithm used by the certificate holder. This key is distributed to the public to initiate a secure connection with a website or remote server.
1. The Subject field names the certificate holder, expressed as a distinguished name (DN). Within this, the common name (CN) usually matches either the fully qualified domain name (FQDN) of a server or a user email address.

What is the purpose of a web server certificate?

1. A web server certificate guarantees the identity of the server that provides web services like a website or e-commerce sites. The web server’s public certificate allows users to submit data securely to the web server.
1. Signing and encrypting email messages is done with an email certificate, typically using Secure/Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions (SMIME) or Pretty Good Privacy (PGP).
1. A code signing certificate is issued to a software publisher following an identity check and validation process to guarantee the validity of a software application or browser plug-in.
1. A root certificate identifies the certificate authority (CA) and is self-signed. The operating system or browser mark self-signed certificates as untrusted, but an administrative user can choose to override this.

If not managed properly, certificate and key management can represent a critical vulnerability. Assess the following statements about key management and select the true statements. **(Select all that apply.)**

1. A problem with key storage is the difficulty associated with multiple backups of a private key. It is exponentially more difficult to ensure the key is not compromised in this situation.
1. If a key is not backed up, it represents a single point of failure. Key recovery is a process for backing up keys and/or recovering data encrypted with a lost key.
1. If a key is compromised and is used for signing only, it can be destroyed, and a new key issued. A key used for encryption cannot be destroyed so easily. The encrypted data has to be recovered first.
1. If the private key used to both encrypt and sign a document is compromised, both uses of the key are of great security risk and may provide external threats more access to private data.

An employee handles key management and has learned that a user has used the same key pair for encrypting documents and digitally signing emails. Prioritize all actions that should be taken and determine the first action that the employee should take.

1. The first step is to recover any data encrypted with the key so the data can be decrypted. Once the data is recovered, the key can be revoked and an administrator can issue a new key pair.
1. After the data has been recovered, the keys should be revoked. They are compromised and should not be used for any future tasks.
1. After the compromised keys are revoked, the user can be issued new keys. The user requires two sets of keys, one for encrypting messages and the other for digitally signing documents.
1. Certificate generation is used to identify the public part of a key pair as belonging to a subject and will occur after the user’s new keys have been generated.

An employee handling key management discovers that a private key has been compromised. Evaluate the stages of a key's life cycle and determine which stage the employee initiates upon learning of the compromise.

1. Upon learning of a compromise, the current key should be revoked, and a new key can then be generated.
1. Certificate generation identifies the public part of a key pair as belonging to a subject, and the subject submits it for signing by the CA as a digital certificate with the appropriate key usage.
1. Key generation occurs during the initial distribution of the key, or after having revoked one.
1. Expiration and renewal are used for a key pair that has not been revoked or expired after a certain period. A given shelf-life increases security.

A company has a critical encryption key that has an *M*-of-*N* control configuration for protection. Examine the examples and select the one that correctly illustrates the proper configuration for this type of protection of critical encryption keys.

1. A correct configuration for an M-of-N control is *M*=3 and *N*=5. *M* stands for the number of authorized administrators that must be present to access the critical encryption keys and *N* is the total number of authorized administrators. In this scenario, 3 of the 5 administrators must be present for access.
1. *M* is always greater than 1 for this type of configuration making *M*=1 and *N*=5 not a valid choice. If only 1 administrator must be present, this configuration would be unnecessary.
1. *M*=6 and *N*=5 is not possible as this configuration is asking for more administrators to be present than is authorized.
1. The final option of *M*=0 is not viable because *M* must always equal more than 1.

A Certificate Revocation List (CRL) has a publish period set to 24 hours. Based on the normal procedures for a CRL, what is the most applicable validity period for this certificate?

1. One or two hours over the publish period is considered normal thus making 26 hours within the window.
1. The validity period is the period during which the CRL is considered authoritative. This is usually a bit longer than the publish period, giving a short window to update and keep the CRL authoritative.
1. The validity period would not be less than the publish period as it would make the CRL nonauthoritative prior to the next publishing.
1. If the validity period was set to 72 hours this would be much too long after the publish period. The CRL would be published two additional times prior to the validity period ending.








**Lesson 7**

Evaluate how identification and authentication are distinct in their functions. Which of the following scenarios best illustrates a user being authenticated?

1. A face scan is also known as biometrics, which is a "something you are" authentication. This is known as behavioral biometric recognition.
1. Creating a user account based on an official company document is an identification process called identity proofing, or verifying subjects are who they say they are.
1. By creating and sending the initial password over a Virtual Private Network (VPN), the administrator is implementing secure transmission of credentials identification process.
1. Identification of a subject on a computer system is done through an account. An account consists of an identifier, credentials, and a profile. Each identifier must be unique, which is accomplished with a Security Identifier (SID) string.

A user presents a smart card to gain access to a building. Authentication is handled through integration to a Windows server that's acting as a certificate authority on the network. Review the security processes and conclude which are valid when using Kerberos authentication. **(Select all that apply.)**

1. Inputting a correct PIN authorizes the smart card's cryptoprocessor to use its private key to create a Ticket Granting Ticket (TGT) request to an Authentication Server (AS).
1. The AS can place trust when the user's certificate is issued by a local or third-party root certification authority.
1. An AS responds with a TGT and Ticket Granting Service (TGS) session key, not the smart card.
1. An AS would be able to decrypt the request because it has a matching public key and trusts the user's smart-card certificate.

Which of the following options represents Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)?

1. In Two-Factor Authentication (2FA), a user must possess two of the three authentication types of “something you know”, “something you have”, or “something you are”. Using a password and a smart card would be 2FA since it combines “something you know” (password) with “something you have” (smart card).
1. Using a password and a PIN is not 2FA since they both are “something you know.”
1. Using a fingerprint and facial recognition is not 2FA since they both are “something you are.”
1. Using a smart card and a key fob is not 2FA since they both are “something you have.”

Evaluate the following controls that have been set by a system administrator for an online retailer. Determine which statement demonstrates the identification control within the Identity and Access Management (IAM) system.

1. Identification controls are set to ensure that customers are legitimate. An example is to ensure that billing and primary delivery addresses are real and valid.
1. Authentication controls are to ensure that customers have unique accounts, and that only they can manage their orders and billing information. An example is to require each customer create an account prior to allowing them to store billing or shipping information.
1. Authorization controls are to ensure customers can only place orders when they have valid payment information in place prior to completing an order.
1. Accounting controls include maintaining a record of each action taken by a customer to ensure that they cannot deny placing an order. Records may include order details, date, time, and IP address information.

Based on the known facts of password attacks, critique the susceptibility of the password "DogHouse23" to an attack.

1. The password does not contain special characters, and also contains words that are found in the dictionary. Both of these attributes make the password vulnerable.
1. The length of the password may be sufficient based on the rules set forth by the system administrator and company policy. The company policy may or may not require the use of special characters, and this is unknown from the scenario.
1. The password is insufficiently complex. The inclusion of uppercase letters alone does not make a password complex.
1. While it is correct that the user may be able to remember this password easily, that also makes it susceptible to attack. Dictionary words make it that much easier for an attacker to crack the password.

Consider biometric methods that are used to authenticate a user. Knowing that errors are possible, which of the following would most likely result in a security breach?

1. Regarding biometric authentication, a false positive is where an unauthorized person is accepted, leading to possible security breaches. This is the False Acceptance Rate (FAR).
1. A false negative is where a legitimate user is not recognized, denying the user access and causing the user an inconvenience. This event does not result in a breach. This is the False Rejection Rate (FRR).
1. The Crossover Error Rate (CER) is the point at which FRR equals FAR. A lower CER indicates more efficient and reliable authentication.
1. Throughput refers to the time required to create a user template and to authenticate. While this is a major consideration for high-traffic access points (airports), a low rate would be frustrating for users, but not a breach risk.


Based on knowledge of the fundamentals of One-time Passwords (OTP), which of the following choices represents the problem that exists with HMAC-based One-time Password Algorithm (HOTP) and is addressed by Time-based One-time Password Algorithm (TOTP)?

1. Tokens can persist unexpired in HOTP, increasing the risk of an attacker obtaining one and decrypting data in the future. TOTP addresses this by adding a value to the shared secret derived from the device’s and server’s local timestamp. TOTP automatically expires each token after a short window of time.
1. The authentication server and client token are configured with the same shared secret in HOTP.
1. The HOTP server is configured with a counter, combining with the shared secret to create a one-time password. When the HOTP value is authenticated, it increments by one.
1. The server and the device both compute the hash and derive a 6-8 digit HOTP value.

Both Remote Access Dial-In User Service (RADIUS) and Terminal Access Controller Access-Control System (TACACS+) provide authentication, authorization, and accounting using a separate server (the AAA server). Based on the protocols' authentication processes, select the true statements. **(Select all that apply.)**

1. RADIUS uses UDP over ports 1812 and 1813 and TACACS+ uses TCP on port 49.
1. TACACS+ encrypts the whole packet (except the header, which identifies the packet as TACACS+ data) and RADIUS only encrypts the password portion of the packet using MD5.
1. RADIUS is primarily used for network access for a remote user and TACACS+ is primarily used for device administration. TACACS+ provides centralized control for administrators to manage routers, switches, and firewall appliances, as well as user privileges.
1. RADIUS is an open-source protocol, not TACACS+. TACACS+ is a Cisco proprietary protocol.

Analyze each scenario and determine which best describes the authentication process in an Identity and Access Management (IAM) system.

1. Authentication proves that a subject is who or what it claims to be when it attempts to access the resource. A CAC and pin login are examples of authentication.
1. Creating an account or ID that identifies the user, device, or process on the network defines identification.
1. Authorization determines what rights subjects should have on each resource and enforcing those rights. A company employee may need network access but will likely not need access to every resource, and limiting access limits a company’s risk.
1. Accounting tracks authorized usage of a resource or use of rights by a subject and alerting when unauthorized use is detected or attempted. Reports and audit logs account for who and what has been accessing network resources.

Analyze the features of behavioral technologies for authentication, and choose the statements that accurately depict this type of biometric authentication. **(Select all that apply.)**

1. Behavioral technologies are sometimes classified as "something you do." These technologies often have a lower cost to implement than other types of biometric cryptosystems, but they have a higher error rate.
1. Typing is used as a behavioral technology, and the template is based on the speed and pattern of a user's input of a passphrase.
1. Signature recognition is not based on the actual signature due to it being easy to replicate. Instead, it is based on the process of applying a signature such as stroke, speed, and pressure of the stylus.
1. Obtaining a voice recognition template is not a fast process, and can be difficult. Background noise and other environmental factors can also interfere with authentication.

When a network uses Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP) as the authentication method, what access control protocol provides the means for a client to connect from a Virtual Private Network (VPN) gateway?

1. Where EAP provides the authentication mechanisms, the IEEE 802.1X Port-based Network Access Control (NAC) protocol provides the means of using an EAP method when a device connects to a VPN gateway.
1. Kerberos is designed to work over a trusted local network. Several authentication protocols have been developed to work with remote access protocols, where the connection is made over a serial link or virtual private network (VPN).
1. TACACS+ uses TCP communications. Authentication, authorization, and accounting (AAA) functions within TACACS+ are discrete.
1. With authentication, authorization, and accounting (AAA), the network access server (NAS) devices (RADIUS or TACACS+) do not have to store any authentication credentials. They forward this data between the AAA server and the supplicant.

Which of the following password cracker attacks are combined to create a typical hybrid password attack? **(Select all that apply.)**

1. A typical hybrid password attack uses a combination of dictionary and brute force attacks.
1. A dictionary attack is a type of password attack that compares encrypted passwords against a predetermined list of possible password values. A brute force attack attempts every possible combination in the key space in order to derive a plaintext password from a hash.
1. Salt is a random or pseudo-random number or string. The term salt is used specifically in conjunction with hashing password values.
1. A pass the hash (PTH) attack occurs when an attacker obtains the hash of a user's password and presents the hash (without cracking it) to authenticate to network protocols.

A security team has just added iris scanners to two access control points in a secure facility. They are in the process of making adjustments to ensure authorized users have access, while unauthorized users cannot get through. Analyze the scenario and determine what metric the team is in the process of fine-tuning.

1. The process of fine-tuning a biometric system involves adjusting the crossover error rate, the point at which the false rejection rate and false acceptance rate meet.
1. The false rejection rate (FRR) is also known as a type I error, which rejects authorized templates.
1. The false acceptance rate (FAR) is the rate at which the system lets in unauthorized users, which constitutes a security breach.
1. A type II error is a false positive, measured by the false acceptance rate (FAR). This is the rate at which unauthorized personnel gain access to the secure facility.

Considering how to mitigate password cracking attacks, how would restricting the number of failed logon attempts be categorized as a vulnerability?

1. Restricting logons can become a vulnerability by exposing a user to Denial of Service (DoS) attacks. The attacker keeps trying to authenticate, locking out valid users.
1. In a replay attack, an intercepted key or password hash is reused to gain access to a resource. This is prevented with once-only tokens or timestamping, not restricting logon attempts.
1. A brute force attack is where an attacker uses an application to exhaustively try every possible alphanumeric combination to crack encrypted passwords. Restricting logon attempts is a way to mitigate this threat, not be vulnerable to it.
1. In an offline attack, a password cracker works on a downloaded password database without having to interact with the authentication system. It is unrelated to logon attempts.

Biometric authentication methods have different error rates, with some methods being easier to fool than others. An unauthorized user is unlikely to fool which of the following methods?

1. Biometric authentication based on a retinal scan is the hardest method to fool. Retinal scanning is used to identify the patterns of blood vessels with the eye, whereas an iris scan only uses the surface of the eye.
1. It is possible to obtain a copy of a user's fingerprint and create a mold of it that will fool a fingerprint scanner.
1. Facial recognition suffers from relatively high false acceptance and rejection rates, and as a result is vulnerable to spoofing.
1. Voice recognition is subject to impersonation. It is also sensitive to background noise and other environmental factors which can interfere with authentication.

Analyze the types of password cracker attacks to determine which scenario best describes a brute force attack.

1. A brute force attack attempts every possible combination in the key space in order to derive a plaintext password from a hash. The key space is determined by the number of bits used.
1. A hybrid password attack uses a combination of dictionary and brute force attacks. It is principally targeted against naively strong passwords. The password cracking algorithm tests dictionary words, and names in combination with several numeric prefixes.
1. A rainbow table attack refines the dictionary approach. The attacker uses a precomputed lookup table of all possible passwords and their matching hashes.
1. A dictionary attack can be used where there is a good chance of guessing the likely value of the plaintext, such as a non-complex password.

Select the explanations that accurately describe the Ticket Granting Ticket (TGT) role within the Authentication Service (AS). **(Select all that apply.)**

1. The Authentication Service (AS) is responsible for authenticating user logon requests. The first step within AS is when the client sends the AS a request for a Ticket Granting Ticket (TGT). This is composed by encrypting the date and time on the local computer with the user's password hash as a key.
1. A User Ticket contains information about the client and includes a timestamp and validity period. The information is encrypted using the KDC's secret key. This occurs after the user is found in the database and the request is valid.
1. The AS does not respond back with a TGT key but with a Ticket Granting Service (TGS) key that is used in communications between the client and the TGS.
1. The TGS is the service that responds with a service session key for use between the client and the application server.

Assess the features and processes within biometric authentication to determine which scenario is accurate.

1. A sensor module acquires the biometric sample from the target. Examples of a sensor module can be a fingerprint scanner or retina scanner.
1. One problem that biometric cryptosystems is the lack of revocability. A legitimate person will almost always have the same template (fingerprint, retina, etc). If a company is using a smart card and it is compromised, the card is revoked and reissued. The same cannot be done for biometric cryptosystems.
1. A feature extraction module records the significant information from the sample. This record would include the fingerprint that was scanned when authentication was requested.
1. A sensor module acquires the biometric sample from the target.


An Identity and Account Management (IAM) system has four main processes. Which of the following is NOT one of the main processes?

1. Integrity is the fundamental security goal of keeping organizational information accurate, free of errors, and without unauthorized modifications. However, it is not part of the IAM system. IAM defines the attributes that comprise an entity's identity. The four processes include Authorization, Accounting, Identification, and Authentication.
1. Accounting is tracking authorized usage of a resource or use of rights by a subject and alerting when unauthorized use is detected or attempted.
1. Identification is creating an account or ID identifying the user, device, or process on the network.
1. Authentication is proving that a subject is who or what it claims to be when attempting to access the resource.










**Lesson 8**

Windows has several service account types, typically used to run processes and background services. Which of the following statements about service accounts is FALSE?

1. The System account, not the Local Service account, creates the host processes that start Windows before the user logs on.
1. The Network Service account and the Local Service account have the same privileges as the standard user account. Standard users have limited privileges, typically with access to run programs, create, and modify files only belonging to their profile.
1. Any process created using the System account will have full privileges over the local computer. The System account has the most privileges of any Windows account.
1. The Local Service account can only access network resources as an anonymous user, unlike a Network Service account. Network Service accounts can present the computer's account credentials when accessing network resources.

Consider the challenges with providing privileged management and authorization on an enterprise network. Which of the following would the network system administrator NOT be concerned with when configuring directory services?

1. Non-repudiation means a subject cannot deny doing something, such as creating, modifying, or sending a resource. It is a consideration for managing privileges and authorization.
1. Confidentiality of the information on the network (read access) is a concern. A user may be able to view a file, but not read it.
1. The integrity of the information on the network (write access) is also a concern. Only users who have write access are able to modify a file.
1. Denial of Service (DoS) is a network-based attack that consumes the network's bandwidth that could impact a directory service, but is more of a network concern than when managing a directory service.

An employee is working on a team to build a directory of systems they are installing in a classroom. The team is using the Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) to update the X.500 directory. Utilizing the standards of an X.500 directory, which of the following distinguished names is the employee most likely to recommend?

1. A distinguished name is a unique identifier for any given resource within an X.500-like directory and made up of attribute=value pairs, separated by commas. The most specific attribute lists first, and then successive attributes become progressively broader.
1. Also referred to as the relative distinguished name, the most specific attribute (in this case, system1) uniquely identifies the object within the context of successive attribute values.
1. The directory schema describes the types of attributes, what information they contain, and the way attributes define object types. Some of the attributes commonly used include Common Name (CN), Organizational Unit (OU), Organization (O), Country (C), and Domain Component (DC).
1. In this scenario, CN=system1 is the Common Name, CN=User is the broader common name, OU=Univ is the Organizational Unit, and DC=local is the Domain Component. This goes in order of a specific system to the broadest Domain Component.

Which type of employee training utilizes gaming and/or scenario-based techniques to emphasize training objectives? **(Select all that apply.)**

1. Capture the Flag (CTF) is usually used in ethical hacker training programs and gamified competitions. Participants complete a series of challenges within a virtualized computing environment to discover a flag that represents a vulnerability or attack to overcome.
1. Computer-based training (CBT) allows a student to acquire skills and experience by completing practical simulations or branching choice scenarios. CBT might use video game elements to improve engagement.
1. A phishing campaign training event means sending simulated phishing messages to users. Users that respond to the messages can be targeted for follow-up training.
1. Staff training should focus on user roles, which require different levels of security training, education, or awareness.

What are the most common, baseline account policies system administrators implement on a secure domain network? **(Select all that apply.)**

1. A password complexity requirement is a baseline account policy commonly enforced in a domain network. It requires the use of upper- and lower-case letters, numbers, and special characters for passwords to make password guessing difficult.
1. A lockout duration period is a common account policy enforced to prevent further attempts to use an account when entering a password fails three times, for example. An administrator can force an unlock when a support ticket is submitted.
1. A password history policy is commonly enforced in a domain network. It prevents reusing the same password up to 24 previously used passwords in a Windows domain.
1. Using a shared account, especially for administrative work, goes against security best practices. Use individual accounts for accountability.

Many access control models are rule-based. Consider how each of the following models determines how users receive rights and determine which model is NOT rule-based.

1. Discretionary Access Control (DAC) is not rule-based. DAC stresses the importance of the owner, who has full control over resources and can modify the Access Control List to grant rights to others.
1. Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) considers a user’s organizational role, such as the rule the systems use to assign rights, rather than being directly assigned the rights.
1. Mandatory Access Control (MAC) uses a security clearance level as the rule to determine a user’s rights
1. Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC) uses a combination of subject and object attributes, along with any context-sensitive or system-wide attributes, as the rule administrators apply when assigning rights. These could include group/role memberships, information about the current OS, the IP address, or the presence of up-to-date patches, and anti-malware.

Which statement best describes the purpose of an acceptable use policy (AUP)?

1. An AUP governs employees' use of company equipment and Internet services. AUPs protect an organization from the security and legal implications of employees misusing its equipment.
1. A code of conduct outlines professional behavior based on ethical standards, such as honesty and fairness.
1. Some professions may have developed codes of ethics to cover difficult situations; some businesses may also have a code of ethics to communicate the values it expects its employees to practice.

An employee has arrived to work and logged into the network with their smart card. This employee now has access to the company databases, email, and shared network resources. Evaluate all of the basic authorization policies and determine the policy best illustrated in this scenario.

1. This company is using a Single Sign-On (SSO) policy. This means that a user only has to authenticate to a system once, to gain access to all the resources to which the system has granted rights to the user. An example is when a user authenticates with Windows, and also authenticates with the Windows domain's SQL Server, and Exchange Server services.
1. Least privilege means that the system grants rights necessary for users to perform their job and no more.
1. Implicit deny is the foundation of a system's access control. This means that unless there is a rule specifying that a system grants access to a user, the system will deny any access request.
1. The system generates an access key for a user when the user supplies authentication data. The system compares it with the server's security database, and both must match. The server security service generates the access key.

Consider the role trust plays in federated identity management and determine which models rely on networks to establish trust relationships. **(Select all that apply.)**

1. Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) is an identity federation format used to exchange authentication information between the principal, the service provider, and the identity provider.
1. Authentication and authorization for a RESTful API is often implemented using the Open Authorization (OAuth) protocol.
1. OpenID is an identity federation method enabling users authentication on cooperating websites by a third-party authentication service.
1. Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) is not an identity federation. It is a network protocol used to access network directory databases storing information about authorized users and their privileges, as well as other organizational information.

Compare all of the functions within directory services and determine which statement accurately reflects the function of group memberships.

1. Group memberships of an authenticated user are on the access key and also contain the user's username. The system provides the access key upon authentication, and the user has access to all of the allowed resources based on the group membership.
1. A security database holds authentication data for users and compares this information with the supplied authentication data from the user. If the supplied data and the data within the security database match, then the system has authenticated the user, and the security database generates an access key.
1. An Access Control List (ACL) controls access to resources. The ACL contains entries for all usernames and groups that have permission to use the resource.
1. A directory is like a database, such as an object is like a record, and the attributes known about the object are like fields.

Analyze and compare the access control models in terms of how Access Control Lists (ACL) are written and determine which statement accurately explains the Discretionary Access Control (DAC) model.

1. In DAC, the owner has full control over the resource, meaning that he or she can modify its ACL to grant rights to others. DAC is the most flexible and weakest control model.
1. With DAC, decision-making lies with the resource owner. In rule-based access control (RBAC) and mandatory access control (MAC), it lies with the system owner (that is, the controls are enforced system-wide and cannot be countermanded or accepted by users "within" the system).
1. DAC is the easiest model to compromise, as it is vulnerable to insider threats and abuse of compromised accounts.
1. Attribute-based access control (ABAC) is a fine-grained, strong access control mechanism, making access decisions based on a combination of subject, object, and context-sensitive or system-wide attributes.

Examine the tradeoff between traditional password policy complexity requirements and updated practical suggestions from the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) and select the statement that fits both practical password management and traditional complexity requirements.

1. Traditional password complexity rules (that is, no use of username within password and combination of at least eight upper/lower case alpha-numeric and non-alpha-numeric characters) often result in users writing down passwords. NIST recommends only blocking common passwords, such as dictionary words, repetitive strings (like 12345678), and contextual information.
1. NIST recommends allowing users to choose a password (or other memorized secret) of between 8 and 64 ASCII or Unicode characters, including spaces.
1. IT should not centrally store plaintext passwords. IT administrators do not need to know users’ plaintext passwords.
1. Users should avoid using dictionary words, strings found in breach databases, and strings that repeat contextual information, such as username or company name.

A network administrator regularly reviews group membership and access control lists for each resource. The administrator also looks for unnecessary accounts to disable. What is the administrator executing in this situation?

1. The administrator is permission auditing, involving the regular review of privileges such as group membership, access control lists for each resource plus identifying, and disabling unnecessary accounts.
1. Recertification is a security control where admin audits user access privileges to ensure they are accurate and adhere to relevant standards and regulations. A resource or user change triggers recertification.
1. Logging is an automated process of capturing data to provide information on the use of the website, alerts of any unusual or suspicious behavior, and audit changes made to pages and settings.
1. Usage auditing means configuring the security log to record key indicators, then reviewing the logs for suspicious activity. This process does not involve reviewing user privileges.

A member of the IT team at a company launches a simulated phishing attack email to users across the organization. Which of these statements most accurately describes the purpose of such an attack?

1. Unless the phishing email is part of a penetration test, other members of the IT team likely know a member of their team is sending a simulated phishing email.
1. A bug bounty is a program operated by a software vendor or website operator where individuals receive rewards for reporting vulnerabilities. While contractors may perform pen tests on a contractual basis, a bug bounty program is a way of crowd sourcing vulnerability detection.
1. A phishing campaign training event means sending simulated phishing messages to users. This allows IT to target those users who respond to the messages for follow-up training.
1. Untrained users represent a serious vulnerability because they are susceptible to social engineering and malware attacks, such as phishing attempts.

A company is instituting role-based training. Which type of training will the company require the data owner to most likely complete?

1. The data owner is responsible for data guardianship and training, for this role will focus on compliance issues and data classification systems.
1. The system owner is responsible for designing and planning computers, networks, and database systems. The role requires expert knowledge of Information Technology (IT) security and network design.
1. The system administrator is responsible for the day-to-day system admin role and requires a technical understanding of access controls and privilege management systems.
1. Privileged users are employees with access to privileged data and require extra training on data management and Personally Identifiable Information (PII) plus any relevant regulatory or compliance frameworks.

Many Internet companies, such as Google and Facebook, allow users to share a single set of credentials between multiple services providers. For example, a user could login to Amazon using their Facebook credentials. Which term correctly defines this example?

1. Federation means the company trusts the accounts created and managed by a different network. The networks establish trust relationships, so the identity of a user (principal) from network A (identity provider), can be trusted as authentic by network B (service provider).
1. SSO (Single-Sign On) means a user authenticates to a system once, to access the resources the system has granted rights to use. This is not an example of a trust relationship.
1. Permission is a security setting, not a trust relationship. It controls access to objects, including file system items and network resources.
1. Access control is the process of determining and assigning privileges to resources, objects, and data. It does not involve a trust relationship.

A senior administrator is teaching a new technician how to properly develop a standard naming convention in Active Directory (AD). Examine the following responses and determine which statements would be sound advice for completing this task. **(Select all that apply.)**

1. Organizational Units (OUs) represent administrative boundaries. They allow the enterprise administrator to delegate administrative responsibility for users and resources in different locations or departments. An OU grouped by location will be sufficient if different IT departments are responsible for services in different geographic locations. An OU grouped by department is more applicable if different IT departments are responsible for supporting different business functions.
1. Within each root-level parent OU, use separate child OUs for different types of objects such as servers, client systems, users and groups. Be consistent.
1. Do not create too many root-level containers or nest containers too deeply. They should not be more than five levels.
1. Separate administrative user and group accounts from standard ones.

An employee recently retired, and the employee received an exit interview, returned a company-issued laptop, and had company-specific programs and applications removed from a personal PC. Evaluate this employee’s offboarding process and determine what, if anything, remains to be done.

1. An exit interview (or offboarding) is the process of ensuring that an employee leaves a company gracefully, and that company assets remain secure.
1. When an employee leaves, proper account management involves disabling the user’s account and privileges.
1. When IT disables an employee’s account, any information assets created or managed by the employee, but owned by the company, must still be accessible in terms of encryption keys or password-protected files.
1. Employee contracts might incorporate the terms of a nondisclosure agreement (NDA), or it could be a separate document. This is generally part of the onboarding process.

Analyze the following scenarios and determine which cases call for account disablement over account lockout. **(Select all that apply.)**

1. If admin detects or suspects an account misuse, they can manually disable the account, preventing the account from being used for login. A remote logoff command can end a session in progress.
1. Smart cards or USB keys can store a user's certificate and private key, which can authenticate to different PCs and mobile devices. A stolen laptop and key represent a vulnerability.
1. An account enters a locked state because of a policy violation, such as entering an incorrect password. Lockouts usually occur for a limited duration.
1. A time of day policy establishes authorized logon hours for an account. Time- and location-based policies prevent users from logging in outside of authorized hours and locales.

A company's clean desk policy will most likely feature which of the following clauses?

1. A clean desk policy means that each employee's work area should be free from any documents left there. The policy aims to prevent sensitive information from being obtained by unauthorized staff or guests at the workplace.
1. A clean desk policy pertains to a user’s physical workspace, rather than a virtual workspace, such as a web browser.
1. The purpose of a clean desk policy is to reduce the chances of compromising sensitive information.
1. Some companies may try to prevent staff from bringing personal devices on site, because such devices represent a data exfiltration risk. When connected to an enterprise system, personal electronic devices pose security complications.

A system administrator has configured a security log to record unexpected behavior and review the logs for suspicious activity. Consider various types of audits to determine which type aligns with this activity.

1. Usage auditing refers to configuring the security log to record key indicators and then reviewing the logs for suspicious activity. Behavior recorded by event logs that differs from expected behavior may indicate everything from a minor security infraction to a major incident.
1. The systems administrator puts in place permission auditing to review privileges regularly. This includes monitoring group membership and access control lists for each resource plus identifying and disabling unnecessary accounts.
1. An information security audit measures how the organization's security policy is employed and determines how secure the network or site is that is being audited.
1. A compliance audit reviews a company's policies and procedures and determines if it is in compliance with regulatory guidelines.

**Lesson 9**

A company is reviewing the options for installing a new wireless network. They have requested recommendations for utilizing WEP, WPA, or WPA2. Differentiate between Wired Equivalent Privacy (WEP) and Wi-Fi Protected Access (WPA). Determine which of the following statements accurately distinguishes between the options. **(Select all that apply.)**

1. WPA2 uses an Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) for encryption, while WPA and WEP use RC4. WPA combines the RC4 with a Temporal Key Integrity Protocol (TKIP), while WEP uses a 24-bit Initialization Vector (IV).
1. WPA2 is the strongest encryption scheme due to the use of AES. WPA is stronger than WEP because of the TKIP. WEP uses the 24-bit IV, which has known vulnerabilities and is the weakest encryption system of the three.
1. A strong password, or the use of enterprise authentication, makes WPA difficult to crack. WEP is the most vulnerable due to the possibility of replay attacks.
1. The encryption options have grown stronger with each development, with WEP deploying first, followed by WPA and WPA2.

Analyze the available detection techniques and determine which are useful in identifying a rogue system through software management. **(Select all that apply.)**

1. Intrusion detection and NAC are security suites and appliances that can combine automated network scanning with defense and remediation suites to prevent rogue devices from accessing the network.
1. Wireless monitoring can reveal the presence of unauthorized or malicious access points and stations.
1. Visual inspection of ports/switches will reveal any obvious unauthorized devices or appliances; however, a sophisticated attack can prevent observation, such as creating fake asset tags.
1. Network mapping can identify hosts unless an OS is actively trying to remain unobserved by not operating when scans are running. Identifying a rogue host on a large network from a scan may still be difficult.

An attacker tricks a host within a subnet into routing through an attacker's machine, rather than the legitimate default gateway, allowing the attacker to eavesdrop on communications and perform a Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) attack. Compare the types of routing vulnerabilities and conclude what the attacker is exploiting in this scenario.

1. ARP poisoning occurs by tricking hosts on the subnet into routing through the attacker's machine rather than the legitimate default gateway. This allows the attacker to eavesdrop on communications and perform replay or MitM attacks.
1. Route injection occurs when routing protocols have weak or no authentication. This can mean traffic misdirected to a monitoring port, sent to a black hole, or continuously looped.
1. Denial of service is redirecting traffic to routing loops or black holes, or overloading the router.
1. Source routing uses an option in the IP header to pre-determine the route a packet will take through the network that it must pass through.

Which statement best describes the difference between session affinity and session persistence?

1. Session affinity is a layer 4 approach to handling user sessions. When a client establishes a session, it stays with the node that first accepted the request.
1. Most network appliances process packets on a best effort and FIFO basis. Layer 4 load balancers only make basic connectivity tests, while layer 7 appliances can test the application's state.
1. An application-layer load balancer uses persistence to keep a client connected to a session. Persistence typically works by setting a cookie, which can be more reliable than session affinity.
1. Quality of Service (QoS) prioritizes traffic based on its characteristics, like bandwidth requirements for video and voice applications. A round robin is a simple form of scheduling that picks the next node.

There are several types of security zones on a network. Analyze network activities to determine which of the following does NOT represent a security zone.

1. A screened host is when a smaller network accesses the Internet using a dual-homed proxy/gateway servers.
1. A Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) is a protected but untrusted area (zone) between the Internet and the private network.
1. Traffic from wireless networks might be less trusted than from a cabled network. If unauthenticated open access points or authenticated guest Wi-Fi networks exist on the network, admin should keep them isolated.
1. A guest network is a zone that allows untrusted or semi-trusted hosts on the local network. Examples include publicly accessible computers or visitors bringing their own portable computing devices to the premises.

During the planning/scoping phase of the kill chain, an attacker decides that a Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack would be the best way to disrupt the target website and remain anonymous. Evaluate the following explanations to determine the reason the attacker chose a DDoS attack.

1. DDoS uses a botnet to launch the attack. Distributed means the attack launches from multiple, compromised computers and devices, which is a botnet. Since the attack will come from multiple IP addresses, it will mask the identity of the attacker.
1. A covert channel is a means of secretly communicating with a compromised machine. The purpose of a DDoS is to overload the target so it’s unavailable to legitimate users, not to communicate with it.
1. A backdoor is a mechanism for gaining access to a computer that bypasses the normal method of authentication. DDoS aims to deny service, not gain access.
1. DDoS attacks do not use impersonation, which is a social engineering technique where one pretends to be someone else.

A team is building a wireless network, and the company has requested the team to use a Wired Equivalent Privacy (WEP) encryption scheme. The team has developed a recommendation to utilize a different encryption scheme based on the problems with WEP. Analyze the features of WEP to determine what problems to highlight in the recommendation.

1. WEP version 1 has both 64-bit and 128-bit keys, while WEP version 2 has 128-bit and 256-bit keys but is still not secure. The main problem with WEP is the 24-bit Initialization Vector (IV). The IV changes the keystream each time, but this does not always occur due to problems. One of the problems is that the IV is not sufficiently large, meaning the system will reuse the IV within the same keystream under load.
1. WEP, depending on the version, allows for the use of 64-, 128-, and 256-bit keys, but none of these options are secure. The IV is not large enough, meaning that the system will reuse it, within the same keystream under load.
1. WEP does have the option to use 64- and 128-bit keys but also allows for 256-bit keys. Packs use a checksum to verify integrity, but that is easy to compute.
1. WEP allows for 64-, 128-, and 256-bit keys. The IV is often not generated using a sufficiently random algorithm.

An Internet Service Provider's (ISP) customer network is under a Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack. The ISP decides to use a blackhole as a remedy. How does the ISP justify their decision?

1. A blackhole drops packets for the affected IP addresses(es). A blackhole is an area of the network that cannot reach any other part of the network which protects the unaffected portion.
1. A blackhole does make the attack less damaging to the other ISP customers but does not send legitimate traffic to the correct destination. The blackhole does not look at packets and simply drops all packets into the black hole.
1. A sinkhole routing routes traffic to a particular IP address, to a different network, so the ISP can analyze and identify the source of the attack.
1. A blackhole is preferred, but it does not evaluate each packet. An ACL option will evaluate each packet but can overwhelm the processing resources, which makes using a blackhole preferred.

Consider the types of zones within a network's topology and locate the zone considered semi-trusted and requires hosts to authenticate to join.

1. An extranet zone is a network of semi-trusted hosts, typically representing business partners, suppliers, or customers. Hosts must authenticate to join the extranet.
1. A private network (intranet) is a network of trusted hosts owned and controlled by the organization. This type of trusted host network is under administrative control and subject to the security mechanisms set up to defend the network.
1. Internet, or guest, zones permit anonymous access by untrusted hosts over the Internet. This can also be a mix of anonymous and authenticated access.
1. Anonymous is not a zone but is a part of the Internet or guest zones.

A network manager suspects that a wireless network is undergoing a deauthentication attack. Applying knowledge of wireless network attacks, which scenario best supports the network manager's suspicion?

1. A deauthentication attack, coupled with the use of a rogue AP, sends a stream of spoofed deauth frames to cause a client to deauthenticate from the AP. This may allow the attacker to interpose the rogue AP or to sniff information about the authentication process.
1. Jamming occurs when a wireless network experiences interference from other radio sources. An attacker may jam a network to position an evil twin on the network.
1. An attacker that creates an AP using a similar name as a legitimate AP is creating an evil twin.
1. A rogue AP is usually coupled with another attack, such as jamming or deauthentication, to obtain critical information.

Evaluate the following choices based on their potential to lead to a network breach. Select the choice that is NOT a network architecture weakness.

1. It is good that not all the hosts can talk to each other. If any host can contact another host, an attacker can penetrate the network edge and gain freedom of movement.
1. A flat architecture is where all hosts can contact each other, exposing an overdependence on perimeter security.
1. When services rely on several different systems, the failure of one will affect the overall performance of other network services.
1. Relying on a single hardware server represents a single point of failure, meaning the whole network crashes if the server goes down.

Given that layer 2 does not recognize Time to Live, evaluate the potential problems to determine which of the following options prevents this issue.

1. STP (Spanning Tree Protocol) is a switching protocol that prevents network loops by dynamically disabling links as needed. Since layer 2 protocol has no concept of Time To Live, layer 2 broadcast traffic could continue to loop through a network with multiple paths indefinitely.
1. ICMP (Internet Control Message Protocol) is an IP-level protocol for reporting errors and status information that supports the function of troubleshooting utilities such as ping.
1. L2TP (Layer 2 Tunneling Protocol) is the standard VPN (Virtual Private Network) protocol for tunneling point-to-point sessions across a variety of network protocols.
1. NTP (Network Time Protocol) is a Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP) application protocol allowing machines to synchronize to the same time clock that runs over UDP port 123.

Which statement regarding attacks on media access control (MAC) addresses accurately pairs the method of protection and what type of attack it guards against? **(Select all that apply.)**

1. In MAC filtering, a switch will record the specified number of MACs allowed to connect to a port, but then drop any traffic from other MAC addresses.
1. DHCP snooping inspects traffic arriving on access ports to ensure that a host is not trying to spoof its MAC address.
1. MAC filtering on a switch defines which MAC addresses are allowed to connect to a particular port, dropping other traffic to protect against MAC flooding attacks.
1. Dynamic ARP inspection (DAI), which can be configured alongside DHCP snooping, prevents a host attached to an untrusted port from flooding the segment with gratuitous ARP replies.

A hotel guest opens their computer and logs into the Wi-Fi without prompting the guest for a username and password. Upon opening an internet browser, a splash page appears that requests the guest's room number and last name for authentication. Which type of authentication is the hotel utilizing?

1. Mostly used on a public access point, open authentication does not require the client to authenticate, as it sends data over the link unencrypted. When combined with a secondary authentication mechanism, a browser can manage open authentication. The secondary authentication redirects the client to a captive portal or a splash page.
1. Wi-Fi Protected Setup (WPS) requires all of the wireless devices to be WPS capable and use a PIN. This type of authentication is common for residential consumers.
1. Extensive Authentication Protocol (EAP) supports different types of authentication within the same overall topology of devices. EAP implementations can include smart cards, one-time passwords, and biometric scanning for authentication.
1. Group authentication uses a pre-shared key that employs a passphrase to generate the key that encrypts communication. The group uses the same secret key.

Given knowledge of load balancing and clustering techniques, which configuration provides both fault tolerance and consistent performance for applications like streaming audio and video services?

1. In active/passive clustering, if the active node suffers a fault, the connection can failover to the passive node, without performance degradation.
1. In an active/active cluster, both nodes process connections concurrently, using the maximum hardware capacity. During failover, the failed node’s workload shifts to the remaining node, the workload on the remaining nodes increases, and performance degrades.
1. Most network appliances process packets on a best effort and first in, first out (FIFO) basis, while the Quality of Service (QoS) framework prioritizes traffic based on its characteristics to better support voice and video applications susceptible to latency and jitter.
1. Failover ensures that a redundant component, device, or application can quickly and efficiently take over the functionality of an asset that has failed.

Evaluate the typical weaknesses found in network architecture and determine which statement best aligns with a perimeter security weakness.

1. Overdependence on perimeter security occurs when the network architecture is flat. If an attacker can penetrate the network edge, the attacker will then have freedom of movement throughout the entire network.
1. A single point of failure occurs with a "pinch point" by relying on a single hardware server or appliance or network channel. Complex dependencies are services that require many different systems to be available.
1. Ideally, the failure of individual systems or services should not affect the overall performance of other network services.
1. Availability over confidentiality and integrity occurs when a company takes shortcuts to get a service up and running. Compromising security might represent a quick fix but creates long term risks.

Identify the attack that can launch by running software such as Dsniff or Ettercap from a computer attached to the same switch as the target.

1. An ARP poisoning attack broadcasts unsolicited ARP reply packets. A sophisticated ARP attack can launch by running software such as Dsniff or Ettercap from a computer attached to the same switch as the target.
1. MAC spoofing changes the MAC address configured on an adapted interface or asserts the use of an arbitrary MAC address. It is simple to override a MAC address in software via OS commands, alterations to the network driver configuration, or using packet crafting software.
1. MAC flooding is a variation of an ARP poisoning attack and usually directed against a switch.
1. One way to launch a MitM attack is to use a Trojan to replace some genuine software on the system. These attacks can also launch against antiquated protocols, such as ARP or DNS.

Where should an administrator place an internet-facing host on the network?

1. Internet-facing hosts reside in one or more Demilitarized Zones (DMZs), or perimeter networks. Traffic can not pass through a DMZ, but it enables external clients to access data on private systems, such as web servers, without compromising the security of the entire internal network.
1. Bastion hosts reside in a DMZ and are not fully trusted by the internal network due to the possibility of Internet compromise.
1. An extranet is a network of semi-trusted hosts, typically representing business partners, suppliers, or customers. Hosts must authenticate to join the extranet.
1. A private network or intranet is a network of trusted hosts owned and controlled by the organization. It should never be Internet-facing.

Compare the characteristics of a rogue Access Point (AP) in wireless networks to determine which statements correctly summarize their attributes. **(Select all that apply.)**

1. A rogue AP masquerading as a legitimate one is an evil twin. When users try to reconnect to an AP after being disconnected, the user could connect to the evil twin unknowingly.
1. An attacker can also form evil twins, giving the AP a similar name (SSID) to that of the legitimate AP. Users may select this AP by mistake, and enter their credentials, which the attacker will capture.
1. Rogue APs can be setup with something as basic as a smartphone with tethering capabilities. It is vital to periodically survey the site to detect rogue APs.
1. When enabling authentication security on the AP (without the attacker knowing the details of the authentication method), a DoS will not succeed. It is important to scan for rogue APs, but the ease of a DoS is not the reasoning behind the need for regular scans.




**Lesson 10**

A network administrator is shopping for a security product to utilize to fine-tune existing firewall and appliance settings. Comparing product features, which type of product is most likely to satisfy the network administrator’s needs?

1. Analyzing NIDS logs allows an administrator to tune firewall rulesets, remove or block suspect hosts and processes from the network, or deploy additional security controls to mitigate any identified threats.
1. A Unified threat management (UTM) product centralizes many types of security controls into a single appliance. A UTM might not perform as well as software or a device with a single dedicated security function.
1. Compared to the passive function of an IDS, an intrusion prevention system (IPS) can provide an active response to any network threats that it matches.
1. An NBAD engine uses heuristics to generate a statistical model baseline normal traffic. The system generates false positives and false negatives until it improves its statistical model of what is "normal."

A network administrator wants to use a proxy server to prevent external hosts from connecting directly with application servers. Which proxy server implementation will best fit this need?

1. A transparent (or forced or intercepting) proxy intercepts client traffic without the client having to reconfigure with the proxy server address. The network admin may implement a transparent proxy on a switch, router, or other inline network appliance.
1. The network admin may configure the client with a non-transparent proxy server address and port number to use it (often configured as port 8080.auto).
1. A caching server that does not require a client-side configuration is called a transparent proxy server. In this type of server, the client is unaware of a proxy server, which redirects client requests without modification.
1. Deployed on the network edge, reverse proxy servers protect servers from direct contact with client requests from a public network (the Internet).

Which of the following are types of log collection for SIEM? **(Select all that apply.)**

1. With the agent-based approach, one must install an agent service on each host. As events occur on the host, logging data is filtered, aggregated, and normalized at the host, then sent to the SIEM server for analysis and storage.
1. With the listener/collector approach, rather than installing an agent, hosts can be configured to push updates to the SIEM server using a protocol such as *syslog* or SNMP. A process runs on the management server to parse and normalize each log/monitoring source.
1. Log aggregation refers to normalizing data from different sources so that it is consistent and searchable and does not refer to a type of log collection
1. Firewalls are a source of logs that are often sent into a SIEM but is not a type of log collection for SIEMs.

Analyze the following scenarios and determine which best simulates a content filter in action. **(Select all that apply.)**

1. A content filter restricts web use to only authorized sites. Examples of content filter uses can be schools restricting access to only sites that are .edu or to not allow sites that have adult-level content.
1. Another example of a content filter can be the workplace, only allowing sites that are for work purposes.
1. A proxy server works on a store-and-forward model and deconstructs each packet, performs analysis, then rebuilds the packet and forwards it on. A part of this process is removing suspicious content in the process of rebuilding the packet.
1. A system admin configures packet filtering firewalls by specifying a group of rules that define the type of data packet, and the appropriate action to take when the packet matches the rule.

Artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning are especially important during which security information and event management (SIEM) task?

1. Data captured from network sensors/sniffers plus netflow sources provide both summary statistics about bandwidth and protocol usage and the opportunity for detailed frame analysis.
1. SIEM software can link individual events or data points (observables) into a meaningful indicator of risk, or Indicator of Compromise (IOC). Many SIEM solutions use artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning as the basis for automated analysis.
1. As distinct from collection, aggregation refers to normalizing data from different sources so that it is consistent and searchable.
1. The first task for SIEM is to collect data inputs from multiple sources, including agent-based log collection, sensor or sniffer data, and listener/collector protocols, such as syslog and Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP).

Which of the following considerations is most important when employing a signature-based intrusion detection system?

1. Network behavior and anomaly detection (NBAD) engines use heuristics to generate a statistical model of baseline normal traffic. The system generates false positives and false negatives until, over time, it improves its statistical model of normal activity. A false positive is where legitimate behavior generates an alert.
1. Behavioral-based detection engines are trained to recognize baseline "normal" traffic or events. Anything that deviates from this baseline generates an incident.
1. The signatures and rules (often called plug-ins or feeds) powering intrusion detection need updating regularly to provide protection against the latest threat types.
1. Behavioral-based detection software attempts to identify zero-day attacks, insider threats, and other malicious activity, for which there is a single signature that deviates from the baseline.

A system administrator wants to install a mechanism to conceal the internal IP addresses of hosts on a private network. What tool can the administrator use to accomplish this security function?

1. A NAT gateway translates between a local and public network by substituting private IPs for a public IP and forwarding the requests to the public Internet, thereby concealing private addressing schemes.
1. Deployed on the network edge, reverse proxy servers protect servers from direct contact with client requests from a public network (the Internet).
1. Virtual firewalls often enact east-west security and zero-trust microsegmentation design paradigms. Virtual firewalls can inspect traffic as it passes from host-to-host or between virtual networks, rather than routing that traffic up to a firewall appliance and back.
1. Firewall access control lists (ACLs) are configured on the principle of least access/least privilege.

Which of the following solutions best addresses data availability concerns that may arise with the use of application-aware next-generation firewalls (NGFW) and unified threat management (UTM) solutions?

1. While complex NGFW and UTM solutions provide high confidentiality and integrity, lower throughput reduces availability. One solution to this is to treat security solutions for server traffic differently from that for user traffic. An SWG acts as a content filter, which applies user-focused filtering rules and also conducts threat analysis.
1. A signature-based detection (or pattern-matching) engine is loaded with a database of attack patterns or signatures. If traffic matches a pattern, then the engine generates an incident.
1. Intrusion prevention systems (IPS), positioned like firewalls at borders between network zones, provide an active response to network threats.
1. A TAP is a hardware device inserted into a cable to copy frames for analysis.

Compare and analyze the types of firewalls available to differentiate between them. Choose the answer with the most correct description.

1. An application firewall can inspect the contents of packets at the application layer and can analyze the HTTP headers. It also analyzes the HTML code present in HTTP packets, to try to identify code that matches a pattern in its threat database.
1. Packet filtering firewalls operate at level 3 of the OSI model while circuit-level stateful inspection firewalls operate at layer 5 of the model.
1. An application aware firewall is also known as a stateful multilayer inspection or a deep packet inspection. An appliance firewall is a stand-alone hardware firewall that performs the function of a firewall only.
1. A packet filtering firewall is stateless, and an application firewall is a software application running on a single host.

Analyze each statement and determine which describes a fundamental improvement on traditional log management that security information and event management (SIEM) offers.

1. While SIEM can automate many functions of log collection and review, security managers may also have to manually prepare data using a Linux command line.
1. Logs typically associate an action with a particular user, satisfying non-repudiation.
1. SIEM correlates individual events or data points (observables) into a meaningful indicator of risk, or Indicator of Compromise (IOC). Correlation is the principal factor distinguishing it from basic log management.
1. Security orchestration, automation, and response (SOAR) is a solution to the problem of the volume of alerts overwhelming analysts' ability to respond. A security engineer may implement SOAR as a standalone technology or integrate it with a SIEM, using machine/deep learning techniques to enrich data for use in incident response and threat hunting.

Security information and event management (SIEM) collect data inputs from multiple sources. Which of the following is NOT one of the main types of log collection for SIEM?

1. With an agent-based approach, data managers must install an agent service on each host. As events occur on the host, logging data is filtered, aggregated, and normalized at the host, then sent to the SIEM server for analysis and storage.
1. A listener/collector appliance gathers or receives log and/or state data from other network systems, using a protocol, such as syslog or simple network management protocol (SNMP).
1. As well as log data, the SIEM might collect packet captures and traffic flow data from sniffers/sensors.
1. AI and machine learning can drive correlation efforts for automated analysis.

Evaluate the functions of a Network-Based Intrusion Detection System (NIDS) and conclude which statements are accurate. **(Select all that apply.)**

1. A NIDS can identify and log hosts and applications and detect attack signatures and other indicators of attack. An administrator can analyze logs to tune firewall rulesets, remove or block suspect hosts and processes, or deploy additional security controls to mitigate threats identified.
1. One of the main disadvantages of NIDS is that training and tuning are complex, which results in high false positive and false negative rates, especially during initial deployment.
1. NIDS training and tuning are complex, with high initial false positive and false negative rates.
1. A NIDS will not block the traffic during an attack, which is a disadvantage. If an administrator does not immediately review logs during an attack, a delay will occur and the attack will continue.

Compare and contrast the characteristics of the various types of firewalls and select the correct explanation of a packet filtering firewall.

1. An administrator configures a packet filtering firewall by specifying a group of rules, called an Access Control List (ACL). Each rule defines a specific type of data packet and the appropriate action to take when a packet matches the rule.
1. Packet filtering firewalls do not maintain stateful information about the connection between two hosts. The firewall analyzes each packet independently, with no record of previously processed packets.
1. Application aware firewalls can inspect the contents of packets at the application layer, which includes analyzing the HTTP headers and the HTML code.
1. An appliance firewall is a stand-alone hardware firewall that monitors all traffic passing into and out of a network segment.

A network administrator conducts a network assessment to determine where to implement a network intrusion detection system (NIDS). Which sensor deployment option is most ideal if the admin is concerned about system overloads and resiliency in the event of power loss?

1. With a passive TAP, the monitor port receives every frame—corrupt, malformed, or not—and load does not affect copying.
1. Because it performs an active function, an active TAP becomes a point of failure for the links in the event of power loss. When deploying an active TAP, it is important to use a model with backup power options.
1. Aggregation TAPs rebuild the upstream and downstream channels into a single channel, but these can drop frames under very heavy load.
1. SPAN/mirror port sensor is not completely reliable, as frames with errors will not be mirrored and frames may be dropped under heavy load.




**Lesson 11**

Transport layer security (TLS) version 1.3 improves upon a vulnerability in TLS1.2. Which statement correctly describes a remedy for this vulnerability?

1. TLS 1.3 removes the ability to perform downgrade attacks by preventing the use of unsecure features and algorithms from previous versions.
1. Configuring a TLS 1.2 server allows clients to downgrade to TLS 1.1 or 1.0 or SSL 3.0 if they do not support TLS 1.2. A man-in-the-middle can use a downgrade attack to try to force the use of a weak cipher suite and secure sockets layer (SSL)/TLS version.
1. Secure shell file transfer protocol (SFTP) addresses the privacy and integrity issues of FTP by encrypting the authentication and data transfer between client and server.
1. The Open Authorization (OAuth) protocol is a standard for federated identity management to consider for secure application programming interfaces (APIs), not a TLS1.3 feature.

A system administrator is configuring a new Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) server. Analyze the types of attacks DHCP servers are prone to and determine which steps the system administrator should take to protect the server. **(Select all that apply.)**

1. The system administrator should use scanning and intrusion detection to pick up suspicious activity.
1. The system administrator should set logging to be enabled and then review the logs regularly for suspicious events.
1. The system administrator should disable unused ports and perform regular physical inspections to ensure that unauthorized devices are not connected via unused jacks.
1. The system administrator should enable DHCP snooping on switch access ports to prevent the use of unauthorized DHCP servers. DHCP snooping acts as a firewall between the server and untrusted hosts and should be enabled versus disabled.

When a company attempts to re-register their domain name, they find that an attacker has supplied false credentials to the domain registrar and redirected their host records to a different IP address. What type of attack has occurred?

1. In domain hijacking (or brandjacking), the attacker steals a domain name by altering its registration information and then transferring the domain name to another entity.
1. Before DNS, a text file named HOSTS recorded name:IP address mapping, which most operating systems still check before using DNS. If an attacker can place a false name:IP address mapping in the HOSTS file, poisoning the DNS cache, the attacker can redirect traffic.
1. The Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) facilitates automatic network address allocation. If an attacker establishes a rogue DHCP, it can perform DoS or snoop on network information.
1. DNS server cache poisoning corrupts records within the DNS server itself.

A system administrator needs to implement a secure remote administration protocol and would like more information on Telnet. Evaluate and select the features of Telnet that the administrator should consider to accomplish this task. **(Select all that apply.)**

1. Telnet is a terminal emulation software used to support a remote connection to another computer. It does not support file transfer directly, but when connected to the computer, it acts as if the keyboard is attached to the remote computer so the same commands can be used as a local user.
1. Telnet uses TCP port 23 by default.
1. Telnet is not secure. Telnet daemon software has exploitable vulnerabilities.
1. Telnet communications, including passwords, are sent in cleartext. One option is to ensure Telnet is only used over a secure channel, such as an IPSec tunnel.

An authoritative server for a zone creates an RRset signed with a Zone Signing Key. Another server requests a secure record exchange and the authoritative server returns the package along with the public key. Evaluate the scenario to determine what the authoritative server is demonstrating in this situation.

1. A DNS Security Extension (DNSSEC) transaction is being simulated. This consists of the authoritative server for the zone creating a package of resource records (RRset) signed with a private key (Zone Signing Key). When another server requests a secure record exchange, the authoritative server returns the package along with its public key, which can verify the signature.
1. DNS is a system for resolving host names and domain labels to IP addresses.
1. DNS footprinting means obtaining information about a private network by using its DNS server to perform a zone transfer (all of the records in a domain) to a rogue DNS.
1. DHCP provides for an automatic method for network address allocation.

A security engineer encrypted traffic between a client and a server. Which security protocol does the engineer configure if an ephemeral key agreement is used?

1. Only ephemeral key agreement is supported in TLS 1.3. The signature type is supplied in the certificate, so the cipher suite only lists the bulk encryption key strength and mode of operation (AES\_256\_GCM), plus the cryptographic hash algorithm (SHA384).
1. Prior to TLS 1.3, Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman Ephemeral mode for session key agreement, RSA signatures, 128-bit AES-GCM (Galois Counter Mode) for symmetric bulk encryption, and 256-bit SHA for HMAC functions can be used.
1. AES 256 refers to a mode of operation used by TLS to encrypt data that is communicated between systems.
1. SHA 384 refers to a cryptographic hashing algorithm that is used for encryption by protocols such as TLS.

Analyze the methods for authentication to a Secure Shell (SSH) and determine which statement best summarizes the host-based authentication method.

1. In host-based authentication, the server is configured with a list of authorized client public keys. The client requests authentication using one of these keys and the server generates a challenge with the public key.
1. The public key authentication method uses the user's private key that is configured with a passphrase that the user must input to access the key.
1. The username and password method require the client to submit credentials that the SSH server verifies against a local user database.
1. The Kerberos method requires the client to submit the Kerberos credentials (TGT) that are obtained when the user logged onto the workstation.

A system administrator uses a Graphical User Interface (GUI) remote administration tool over TCP port 3389 to manage a server operating Windows 2016. Evaluate the types of remote administration tools to conclude which protocol the administrator is using.

1. Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) is Microsoft's protocol for operating remote connections to a Windows machine. RDP uses TCP port 3389.
1. Secure Shell (SSH) is the principal means of obtaining secure remote access to a UNIX or Linux server.
1. Telnet is terminal emulation software to support a remote connection to another computer and uses TCP port 23 by default. Telnet is not secure but can be used over a secure channel, such as an IPSec tunnel.
1. The Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) provides an automatic method for network address allocation.

If an administrator in an exchange server needs to send digitally signed and encrypted messages, what messaging implementation will best suit the administrator’s needs?

1. One means of applying authentication and confidentiality on a per-message basis is an email encryption standard called Secure/Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions (S/MIME). S/MIME adds digital signatures and public key cryptography to mail communications. To use S/MIME, a sender and receiver exchange digital certificates signed by a certification authority (CA).
1. POP3 is a mailbox protocol designed to store the messages delivered by SMTP on a server. When the client connects to the mailbox, POP3 downloads the messages to the recipient's email client.
1. IMAP4 is an application protocol that allows a client to access and manage email messages stored in a mailbox on a remote server.
1. SMTP is the basic protocol used to send mail between hosts on the Internet.

An organization routinely communicates directly to a partner company via a domain name. The domain name now leads to a fraudulent site for all users. Systems administrators find incorrect host records in DNS. What do the administrators believe to be the root cause?

1. DNS server cache poisoning aims to corrupt the records held by the DNS server itself. A DNS server queries an authoritative server for domain information. An attacker can masquerade as an authoritative name server and respond with fraudulent information.
1. An ARP cache contains entries that map IP addresses to MAC addresses. An ARP cache is not related to name resolution.
1. Before developers created DNS, early name resolution took place using a text file named HOSTS. In this case, all users are experiencing an issue, not just some.
1. Domain Reputation can be impacted if an attacker hijacks public servers. In this case, systems admin found invalid host records, which ruled out hijacking.

A system administrator needs secure remote access into a Linux server. Evaluate the types of remote administration to recommend which protocol should be used in this situation.

1. Secure Shell (SSH) is the principal means of obtaining secure remote access to a UNIX or Linux server. The main uses of SSH are for remote administration and secure file transfer (SFTP).
1. Telnet is a terminal emulation software used to support a remote connection to another computer. It does not support file transfer directly, and is not secure.
1. Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) is Microsoft's protocol for operating remote connections to a Windows machine.
1. SSH uses Kerberos to allow authentication to the SSH server. Kerberos uses the Ticket Granting Ticket (TGT) method.

A technician is configuring Internet Protocol Security (IPSec) for communications over a Virtual Private Network (VPN). Evaluate the features of available modes and recommend the best option for implementation.

1. The technician should use tunnel mode because the whole IP packet, including header and payload, is encrypted and a new IP header added. This mode is used for communications across an unsecure network (creating a VPN).
1. In transport mode, the IP header for each packet is not encrypted, just the data (payload). This mode is used for secure communications on a private network (an end-to-end implementation).
1. In tunnel mode, the header and the payload are encrypted.
1. In transport mode, the payload is encrypted but this does not provide sufficient security for a VPN.

An attacker modifies the HOSTS file on a workstation to redirect traffic. Consider the types of attacks and deduce which type of attack has likely occurred.

1. The HOSTS file is checked before using Domain Name System (DNS). Its contents are loaded into a cache of known names and the client only contacts a DNS server if the name is not cached. If an attacker can place a false name, then the attacker will be able to direct traffic.
1. A pharming attack occurs when the attacker compromises the process of DNS resolution to replace the valid IP address for a trusted website.
1. A DNS server cache poisoning attack is a redirection attack that aims to corrupt the records held by the DNS server itself.
1. DNS spoofing is an attack that compromises the name resolution process.

A system administrator is setting up a new Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP) configuration. Make recommendations for how the administrator should configure the ports. **(Select all that apply.)**

1. Port 25 is used for message relay between Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP) servers or Message Transfer Agents (MTA). If security is required and supported by both servers, the STARTTLS command can be used to set up the secure connection.
1. Port 465 is used by providers and mail clients for message submission over implicit Transport Layer Security (TLS).
1. Port 587, versus 110, is used by mail clients (Message Submission Agents) to submit messages for delivery by an SMTP server.
1. Port 143 is used by Internet Message Access Protocol (IMAP) to connect clients. IMAP supports permanent connections to a server and connecting multiple clients to the same mailbox simultaneously.






**Lesson 12**

A network manager is installing a new switch on the network. Compare the hardening processes for servers, appliances, and applications to recommend the hardening steps that should be taken to complete the task.

1. Network appliances, such as switches, present a special case for hardening. Most of these devices are often only configurable within the parameters allowed by their manufacturers. Hardening is often restricted to ensuring the device is patched and configured correctly.
1. GPOs are used on Windows networks and are a means of applying security settings across a range of computers. Since the switch is a network appliance, a GPO is not applicable in this situation.
1. The Server Core option may be utilized when installing a server on the network. It excludes most of the familiar shell tools and only supports a limited number of roles, including Hyper-V and DHCP.
1. Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer (MBSA) is used on Windows networks and validates the security configuration.

Evaluate the features and vulnerabilities found in medical devices and then select the accurate statements. **(Select all that apply.)**

1. Attackers may have a goal of injuring or killing patients by tampering with dosage levels or device settings.
1. Many of the control systems for medical devices run on unsupported versions of operating systems, such as Windows XP, because the costs of updating the software to work with newer OS versions is high and disruptive to patient services.
1. Medical devices can be found in the hospital, clinic, and as portal devices such as cardiac monitors, defibrillators, and insulin pumps.
1. Medical devices may have unsecure communications protocols. Many devices run on unsupported systems due to the cost and potential disruptions the update would cause.

During a training event, an executive at a large company asks the security manager trainer why pushing automatic updates as a patch management solution is not ideal for their Enterprise network. How will the security manager most likely respond?

1. Enterprise networks need to be cautious about automated deployment, as a patch that is incompatible with an application or workflow can cause availability issues. If multiple applications run update clients on the same host, performance issues may also arise.
1. Scheduling conflicts may influence patch management decisions, but in an enterprise network, a patch management suite, rather than an individual, will handle updates.
1. Endpoint detection and response (EDR) products analyze system data and logs to provide early threat detection.
1. Patch management suites identify, test, and deploy operating system (OS) and application updates. Patches are often classified as critical, security-critical, recommended, and optional.

You are asked to help design a security system. What are some methods that can be used to mitigate risks to embedded systems in such environments? **(Select all that apply.)**

1. Firmware patching for embedded systems is just as vital as keeping host OS software up to date on a traditional computer. 
1. Network segmentation is one of the core principles of network security. This control network should be separated from the corporate network using firewalls and VLANs.
1. One way of increasing the security of data in transit for embedded systems is through the use of wrappers, such as IPSec. The only thing visible to an attacker or anyone sniffing the wire is the IPSec header, which describes only the tunnel endpoints. 
1. A faraday cage would help prevent outside interference or leakage of wireless radio frequencies, but may inhibit the use of a security system, such as a keyless door.

Compare and evaluate the various levels and types of platform security to conclude which option applies to a hardware Trusted Platform Module (TPM).

1. A Trusted Platform Module (TPM) is a specification for hardware-based storage of digital certificates, keys, hashed passwords, and other user and platform identification information.
1. A hardware RoT, or trust anchor, is a secure subsystem that can provide attestation. When a computer joins a network, it may submit a report to the NAC declaring valid OS files. The RoT scans the boot metrics and OS files to verify their signatures.
1. A secure boot is a security system designed to prevent a computer from being hijacked by a malicious OS.
1. The Basic Input/Output System (BIOS) provides an industry standard program code that operates the essential components of the PC and ensures that the design of each manufacturer's motherboard is PC compatible.

A company security manager takes steps to increase security on Internet of Things (IoT) devices and embedded systems throughout a company’s network and office spaces. What measures can the security manager use to implement secure configurations for these systems? **(Select all that apply.)**

1. Some embedded systems use legacy OSes, making them difficult to secure. Isolating these hosts from others through network segmentation and using endpoint security can help secure them against exploitation.
1. One way of increasing the security of data in transit for embedded systems is through the use of wrappers, such as IPSec, which secures data through authentication and encryption.
1. Only specific security control functions require network access for static environments, which the security manager should keep separate from the corporate network with perimeter security.
1. When designed for residential use, IoT devices can suffer from weak defaults that customers do not take steps to secure. The security manager can configure them to "work" with a minimum of configuration effort.

Evaluate approaches to applying patch management updates to select the accurate statement.

1. It is well recognized that Operating System major release updates can cause problems with software application compatibility.
1. The least time-consuming approach is to apply all of the latest patches. A system administrator who applies patches on a case-by-case basis must stay up to date with security bulletins to see if a patch is necessary.
1. Patches are usually provided at no cost. The cost associated with patches is the time it takes to test, review, and apply them.
1. It is best practice to trial and update on a test system to try to discover whether it will cause any problems. Applying a patch immediately could do more harm than good to the workstations.

Examine the differences between general purpose personal computer hosts and embedded systems and select the true statements regarding embedded system constraints. **(Select all that apply.)**

1. Many embedded devices are battery-powered and may need to run for years without having to replace the cells. Processing must be kept to the minimum possible level.
1. Embedded systems often use system on chip (SoC), a design where processors, controllers, and devices reside on a single processor die (or chip). This packaging saves space and is usually power efficient.
1. TPM establishes a root of trust at the hardware level on PC, but most embedded systems do not have embedded TPMs, so they must rely on implicit trust and network perimeter security.
1. Customers can program a field programmable gate array (FPGA) to run a specific application an embedded system requires, which is more efficient than running a pre-programmed device.

Compare the features of static and dynamic computing environments and then select the accurate statements. **(Select all that apply.)**

1. An embedded computing environment is a complete computer system that is designed to perform a specific, dedicated function. A PC is a dynamic computing environment where the user can add or remove programs and data files.
1. A dynamic computing environment provides users more control to perform actions like install or update applications. A static computing environment update will usually only be available through specific management interfaces.
1. A static computing environment gives less control than a dynamic computing environment. Each embedded system may differ in how each one is handled or maintained, and therefore may require more manual tasks than dynamic systems.
1. A static computing environment is easier to protect. This is due to the unchanging environment without adding new hardware or software. With fewer changes and additions, the systems are not introduced to as many threats.

Analyze the features of a Full Disk Encryption (FDE) to select the statements that accurately reflect this type of security. **(Select all that apply.)**

1. FDE means that the entire contents of the drive, including system files and folders, are encrypted. The cryptographic operations performed by the OS reduces performance.
1. FDE normally utilizes a Trusted Platform Module (TPM) to secure the storage of the key used to encrypt the drive contents.
1. FDE means that the entire content of the drive (or volume), including system files and folders, are encrypted. This is not limited to only critical files.
1. FDE requires secure storage of the key used to encrypt the drive contents. Normally, this is in a TPM. It is also possible to use a removable USB drive if USB is a boot device option.

Compare and evaluate the various levels and types of security found within a Trusted OS (TOS) to deduce which scenario is an example of a hardware Root of Trust (RoT).

1. A hardware RoT, or trust anchor, is a secure subsystem that can provide attestation. When a computer joins a network, it may submit a report to the NAC declaring valid OS files. The RoT scans the boot metrics and OS files to verify their signatures.
1. A secure boot is a security system designed to prevent a computer from being hijacked by a malicious OS.
1. A Trusted Platform Module (TPM) is a specification for hardware-based storage of digital certificates, keys, hashed passwords, and other user and platform identification information.

Contrast vendor support for products and services at the end of their life cycle. Which of the following statements describes the difference between support available during the end of life (EOL) phase and end of service life (EOSL) phase?

1. When a manufacturer discontinues a product’s sales, it enters an end of life (EOL) phase in which support and availability of spares and updates grow limited. An end of service life (EOSL) system is one whose developer or vendor no longer supports.
1. EOSL products no longer receive security updates and represent a critical vulnerability if companies actively use them.
1. Microsoft provides Windows versions five years of mainstream support and five years of extended support (during which Microsoft only ships security updates). Most OS and application vendors have similar policies.
1. Well-maintained open-source software may have long term support (LTS) versions. Developers may also abandon software, and companies who rely on such abandonware must assume any maintenance responsibility.

A system administrator has received new systems to deploy within a work center. Which of the following should the system administrator implement to ensure proper hardening without impacting functionality? **(Select all that apply.)**

1. Interfaces provide a connection to the network and some machines may have more than one interface. If any of these interfaces are not required they should be explicitly disabled rather than left unused.
1. Services provide a library of functions for different types of applications. Unused services should be disabled.
1. Not all third-party software should be removed. Hardening a system can also restrict the system's capabilities. Additionally, the need for hardening must be balanced against the access requirements and usability in a particular situation.
1. Application service ports allow client software to connect to applications. These should be closed if access is not required, but be left open if required to conduct business.

Given knowledge of secure firmware implementation, select the statement that describes the difference between secure boot and measured boot.

1. Secure boot is about provisioning certificates for trusted operating systems and blocking unauthorized OSes. Measured boot stores and compares hashes of critical boot files to detect unauthorized processes.
1. Secure boot requires UEFI but does not require a TPM. A trusted or measured boot process uses platform configuration registers (PCRs) in the TPM at each stage in the boot process to check whether hashes of key system state data have changed.
1. Attestation is the process of sending a signed boot log or report to a remote server.
1. Secure boot prevents the use of a boot loader or kernel that has been changed by malware (or an OS installed without authorization).

A system administrator is deploying a new web server. Which hardening procedures should the administrator consider? **(Select all that apply.)**

1. Secure file transfer protocol (SFTP) safely transfers files remotely via SSH.
1. Transport layer security (TLS) enables secure communication between the client and the web server. This is implemented by assigning a certificate to the web server. TLS 1.3 prevents downgrade attacks.
1. Most web servers must allow for secure access to guests. Guest accounts should only be allowed to view content in the website and not from any other web server directory.
1. Web servers should deploy using configuration templates where possible.

Select the options that can be configured by Group Policy Objects (GPOs). **(Select all that apply.)**

1. Group Policy Objects (GPOs) are a means of applying security settings across a range of computers. They can be used to configure software deployment among several other tasks.
1. GPOs can configure registry settings across a range of computers.
1. Code signing is the principal means of proving the authenticity and integrity of code (an executable or a script). A GPO can deploy Code Integrity (CI) policies to check for application publisher digital signatures, but not for signing or creating new digital signatures.
1. Baseline deviation reporting tests the configuration of clients and servers to ensure they are patched, and their configuration settings match the baseline template.














**Lesson 13**

A user facing a tight deadline at work experiences difficulties logging in to a network workstation, so the user activates a smartphone hotspot and connects a personal laptop to save time. Which of the following vulnerabilities has the user potentially created for the enterprise environment?

1. Wi-Fi hotspot functionality should typically be disabled when a device is connected to an enterprise network, as it might circumvent security mechanisms, such as data loss prevention or web content filtering policies.

1. Unless the owner configures some form of authentication, a discoverable device is vulnerable to bluejacking, a type of spam where the victim receives an unsolicited text (or picture/video) message or vCard (contact details).
1. Bluetooth is generally less susceptible to jamming than Wi-Fi or GPS signals.
1. Jailbreaking occurs when an attacker gains root privileges. An attacker may use jailbreaking to sideload apps, change or add mobile carriers, or customize OS interfaces.

An attacker uses spoofed GPS coordinates on a stolen mobile device, attempting to gain access to an enterprise network. Which statement best describes the attack vector?

1. An attacker can spoof GPS signals using specialist radio equipment to defeat geofencing mechanisms. Geofencing can create a virtual network boundary (based on real-world geography) that utilizes context-aware authentication for establishing a network perimeter on a company’s premises.
1. A host operating system may provision an isolated execution environment for an application with containerization.
1. Bluesnarfing uses an exploit in Bluetooth to steal information from someone else's phone. The exploit (now patched) allows attackers to circumvent the authentication mechanism.

Analyze and compare iOS and Android operating systems (OS) to accurately differentiate between the two. **(Select all that apply.)**

1. iOS is the operating system for Apple's iPhone and iPad tablet. Android is an OS for smartphones and tablets, and is an open source OS. This provides more scope for hardware vendors such as Asus, LG, and Samsung.
1. Android is an open source OS based on Linux. iOS is a closed and proprietary system.
1. Apple makes new versions freely available for iOS, with devices typically updated very quickly. Android offers updates more sporadically, as updates are often dependent on the handset vendor to complete.
1. Android is more vulnerable to attack than iOS. Sporadic updates along with apps being installed from multiple vendors, reduces the security on the devices. iOS is a closed source with frequent updates, providing more security.

The owner of a company asks a network manager to recommend a mobile device deployment model for implementation across the company. The owner states security is the number one priority. Which deployment model should the network manager recommend for implementation?

1. Corporate Owned, Business Only (COBO) devices provide the greatest security of the four mobile device deployment models. The device is the property of the company and may only be used for company business.
1. The Bring Your Own Device (BYOD) model is the least secure of the four models. The device is owned by the employee, and the employee agrees to use it for company use.
1. Deploying a Choose Your Own Device (CYOD) model means the device is chosen by the employee and owned by the company. The employee is able to use the device for personal business.
1. A Corporate Owned, Personally-Enabled (COPE) device is supplied and chosen by the company and personal use is allowed.

Which microwave connection mode is most appropriate for forming a strong connection between two sites?

1. A point-to-point topology occurs when two nodes have a dedicated connection to one another. In a point-to-multipoint topology, a central node mediates links between remote nodes.
1. Point-to-multipoint (P2M) microwave uses smaller sectoral antennas, each covering a separate quadrant. Where P2P is between two sites, P2M links multiple sites or subscriber nodes to a single hub.
1. Over-the-air (OTA) firmware updates are delivered to radio devices via a cellular data connection.
1. The USB on the go (OTG) specification allows a mobile device to act as a host when a device, such as an external drive or keyboard, is attached. USB OTG allows a port to function either as a host or as a device.

Pilots in an Air Force unit utilize government-issued tablet devices loaded with navigational charts and aviation publications, with all other applications disabled. This illustrates which type of mobile device deployment?

1. The company owns the device and dictates the device’s purpose in the corporate owned, business only (COBO) model.
1. Employees own their own devices that meet business configuration standards and run corporate applications in the bring your own device (BYOD) model. Businesses may oversee and audit user-owned devices to some extent, but this model poses significant security challenges.
1. In the corporate owned, personally-enabled (COPE) model, the company chooses, supplies, and owns the device, but authorizes personal use, (subject to acceptable use policies).
1. With choose your own device (CYOD), the company owns and supplies the device, but the employee chooses it.

Analyze the following scenarios and determine which accurately describes the use of an ad hoc Wi-Fi network.

1. Multiple wireless devices can establish peer-to-peer connections with one another, rather than using an access point. The devices will operate in ad hoc mode rather than infrastructure mode and are meant to be temporary networks.
1. A smartphone can share its mobile data connection with a PC, for example, via USB. This type of connection is commonly referred to as tethering where the smartphone acts as a hotspot.
1. A mobile device creates a personal area network (PAN) when connecting to peripherals like a wireless speaker or keyboard via Bluetooth for example.
1. A smartphone tethers to share a connection via a Bluetooth connection with a single PC. The term "Wi-Fi tethering" is also widely used to mean a hotspot.

A user would like to install an application on a mobile device that is not authorized by the vendor. The user decides the best way to accomplish the install is to perform rooting on the device. Compare methods for obtaining access to conclude which type of device the user has, and what actions the user has taken.

1. Rooting is a term associated with Android devices. Some vendors provide authorized mechanisms for users to access the root account on their device. For some devices, it is necessary to exploit a vulnerability or use custom firmware.
1. A user who has an iOS device and wants access to the administrator account will perform an action called jailbreaking versus rooting.
1. If the user had an iOS device, and has booted the device with a patched kernel, the term would have been jailbreaking.
1. An Android device is not able to be booted with a patched kernel. Custom firmware or access from the vendor is required to obtain administrator access.


**Lesson 14**

Which of the following statements differentiates between input validation and output encoding?

1. Input validation ensures that an application can appropriately handle the data entered into a field or variable in the application. Output encoding occurs when a script passes data to another script. Output encoding ensures it is not passing any malicious "script" contents.
1. Input validation occurs when a script takes data passed to it by some other process. Client-side code, server-side code, or both, can perform input validation.
1. Output encoding avoids the assumption that input will have been sanitized already.
1. HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS) forces a browser to connect using HTTPS only, mitigating downgrade attacks, such as SSL stripping. Cache-control sets whether the browser can cache responses.

Which malicious code indicator is a minimal program designed to exploit a buffer overflow?

1. Shellcode is a minimal program designed to exploit a buffer overflow or similar vulnerability to gain privileges, or to drop a backdoor on the host if run as a Trojan.
1. Credential dumping is when malware might try to access the credentials file (SAM on a local Windows workstation) or sniff credentials held in memory by the lsass.exe system process.
1. Lateral movement/insider attack is the general procedure that uses the foothold to execute a process remotely, using a tool such as psexec.
1. Persistence is a mechanism that allows the threat actor's backdoor to restart if the host reboots or the user logs off.

Evaluate the Agile paradigm within a Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC) to determine which statement demonstrates the idea of continuous tasks.

1. Agile development flips the waterfall model by iterating through phases concurrently on smaller modules of code.  In this model, development and provisioning tasks are conceived as continuous.
1. The concept phase includes devising the initial scope and vision for the project and to determine its feasibility.
1. The iteration phase consists of prioritizing requirements and working through cycles of designing, developing, testing, and test deploying solutions to the project goals.
1. The transition phase includes performing the final integration and testing of the solution and preparing for deployment in the user environment.

A system administrator is working to restore a system affected by a stack overflow. Analyze the given choices and determine which overflow vulnerability the attacker exploited.

1. A stack is an area of memory used by a program subroutine. It includes a return address, which is the location of the program that is called the subroutine. An attacker could use a buffer overflow to change the return address, which is called a stack overflow.
1. A heap is an area of memory allocated by an application during execution to store a variable. A heap overflow can overwrite the variables with unexpected effects.
1. An array is a type of variable designed to store multiple values. It is possible to create an array index overflow by exploiting unsecure code to load the array with more values than it expects.
1. An integer overflow attack causes the target software to calculate a value that exceeds bounds that are set by the software.

A hacker compromises a web browser and uses access to harvest credentials users input when logging in to banking websites. What type of attack has occurred?

1. A man-in-the-browser (MitB) attack compromises the web browser. An attacker may be able to inspect session cookies, certificates, and data, change browser settings, perform redirection, and inject code.
1. An evil twin is a rogue WAP masquerading as a legitimate one. It can capture user logon attempts, allow man-in-the-middle attacks, and allow access to private information.
1. Session hijacking involves replaying a web application cookie in some way. Attackers can sniff network traffic to obtain session cookies sent over an unsecured network.
1. In a clickjacking attack, the user sees and trusts as a web application with a login page or form that contains a malicious layer or invisible iFrame that allows an attacker to intercept or redirect user input.

Which of the following is NOT a scripting language?

1. Automated or procedural scripting languages take standard arguments as data, so there is less scope for uncertainty over configuration choices leading to errors. A domain-specific language (DSL) performs a particular task, such as regex string parsing.
1. PowerShell is the preferred method of performing Windows administration tasks, which also makes it a go-to toolkit for hackers. Most PowerShell usage is founded on cmdlets. A cmdlet is a compiled library that exposes some configuration or administrative task.
1. JavaScript is a general purpose scripting language used to create and control dynamic website content.
1. Python is a popular language for implementing a variety of development projects, including automation tools and security tools, as well as malicious scripts.

An attacker finds a way to exploit a vulnerability in a target application that allows the attacker to bypass a password requirement. Which method did the attacker most likely use?

1. An attacker could exploit the vulnerability with an LDAP injection attack, inserting the (&) operator to return a condition that is always true, dropping the password filter for a name=value pair.
1. A stored/persistent cross-site scripting (XSS) attack aims to insert unsanitized code into a back-end database a trusted site uses. When other users view the posted message, the malicious script executes.
1. Data submitted via extensible markup language (XML) with no encryption or input validation is vulnerable to spoofing, request forgery, and injection of arbitrary data or code.
1. In a SQL injection attack, the attacker modifies basic SQL functions by adding code. This could be with input an app accepts. In this case, LDAP was compromised and not an input to an application.

Compare and contrast the types of Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks, and select the option that accurately distinguishes between them.

1. Both reflected and stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks exploit server-side scripts. The third type of XSS attack exploits vulnerabilities in client-side scripts, and these scripts often use the Document Object Model (DOM) to modify the content and layout of a web page.
1. Both reflected and stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks exploit server-side scripts, not client-side. Document Object Model (DOM) modifies the content and layout utilizing client-side scripts.
1. While reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks exploit server-side scripts, Document Object Model (DOM) exploits client-side scripts. A stored attack exploits server-side scripts.
1. A nonpersistent attack is another name for reflected, and a persistent attack is another name for a stored attack. Both of these attacks exploit server-side scripts. DOM exploits client-side scripts.

Code developers de-conflict coding with one another during which phase of the software development life cycle (SDLC)?

1. Continuous integration (CI) is the principle that developers should commit and test updates often. CI aims to detect and resolve coding conflicts early.
1. Continuous delivery is about testing all of the infrastructures that support an app, including networking, database functionality, client software, and so on.

1. A vulnerability is a design flaw that can cause the application security system to be circumvented, or will cause the application to crash.
1. An input validation attack passes invalid data to the application. Since the input handling on the routine is inadequate, it causes the application or even the operating system to behave in an unexpected way.
1. In a buffer overflow vulnerability, the attacker passes data to deliberately overfill the buffer that the application reserves to store the expected data.

A threat analyst is asked about malicious code indicators. Which indicator allows the threat actor's backdoor to restart if the host reboots or the user logs off?

1. Persistence is when a mechanism allows the threat actor's backdoor to restart if the host reboots or the user logs off. Typical methods are to use AutoRun keys in the registry or adding a scheduled task.
1. Credential dumping is where the malware might try to access the credentials file or sniff credentials held in memory by the lsass.exe system process.
1. Shellcode is a minimal program designed to exploit a buffer overflow or similar vulnerability to gain privileges, or to drop a backdoor on the host if run as a Trojan. Having gained a foothold, this type of attack will be followed by some type of network connection to download additional tools.
1. Lateral movement/insider attack uses the foothold to execute a process remotely. If the attacker has compromised an account, these commands can blend in with ordinary network operations.

Which cookie attribute can a security admin configure to help mitigate a request forgery attack?

1. Cookies can be a vector for session hijacking and data exposure if not configured correctly. Use the SameSite attribute to control where a cookie may be sent, mitigating request forgery attacks.
1. Set the Secure attribute to prevent a cookie from being sent over unencrypted HTTP.
1. Set the HttpOnly attribute to make the cookie inaccessible to document object model/client-side scripting.
1. A number of security options can be set in the response header returned by the server to the client, including Cache-Control, which sets whether the browser can cache responses. Preventing caching of data protects confidential and personal information where multiple users might share the client device.

Analyze the following statements and select the statement which correctly explains the difference between cross-site scripting (XSS) and cross-site request forgery (XSRF).

1. A client-side or cross-site request forgery (CSRF or XSRF) can exploit applications that use cookies to authenticate users and track sessions. XSS exploits a browser’s trust and can perform an XSRF attack.
1. XSS inserts a malicious script that appears to be part of a trusted site. XSS can conduct an XSRF attack.
1. XSRF passes an HTTP request to the victim’s browser that spoofs a target site action, such as changing a password. The attacker can disguise and accomplish this request without the victim necessarily having to click a link.
1. XSRF is a client-side exploit. An XSS attack may be reflected (nonpersistent) or stored (persistent) and may target back-end systems (server-side) or client-side scripts.

Which of the following is a common solution that protects an application from behaving in an unexpected way when passing invalid data through an attack?

1. Input validation is a primary vector for attacking applications. If the application cannot check for valid inputs, a hacker can take advantage of this vulnerability to enter in commands that can query a database, for example, and obtain confidential data.
1. A buffer overflow occurs when an attacker passes data to deliberately overfill the buffer that the application reserves to store the expected data.
1. Race conditions occur when events fail to execute in the order and timing intended by the developer. Applications are vulnerable to this when the outcome from an execution process is directly dependent on the order and timing of certain events.
1. A zero-day exploit is described as a vulnerability that is exploited before the developer knows about it or can release a patch.

Examine each of the following statements and determine which most accurately compares an allow and block list control practices.

1. Execution control is the process of determining what additional software or scripts a host can run or install beyond its baseline. An allow list is a default-deny policy that means only running authorized processes and scripts. An allow list may impede accessibility and increase support time and costs.
1. A block list is a default-allow policy that prevents the execution of listed processes and scripts. It is vulnerable to software exploits not previously labeled as malicious.
1. Access control schemes refer to how users receive rights or permissions to access network resources.
1. Discretionary access control (DAC) depends on a resource owner, who controls the resource’s access control list.

Which method might an attacker use to redirect login via information gained by implementing JavaScript on a webpage the user believes is legitimate?

1. Clickjacking is an attack characterized as a difference between what a user sees and trusts as a web application with a login page or form, and the reality of the page or form containing a malicious layer or invisible iFrame, allowing an attacker to intercept or redirect user input.
1. A Man-in-the-Browser (MitB) attacks occur when the web browser is compromised by installing malicious plugins or scripts or intercepting API calls between the browser process and a Dynamic Link Library (DLL).
1. If a target site assumes the browser is authenticated because there is a valid session cookie and does not complete any additional authorization process, a confused deputy attack has occurred.
1. A reflected attack exploits vulnerabilities on the server-side script and is one of the most powerful input validation exploits. It involves a trusted site, a client browsing the trusted site, and the attacker's site.

Which scripting language is the preferred method of performing Windows administration tasks?

1. Powershell is the preferred method of performing Windows administration tasks.
1. Javascript is the programming language of the web and is one of the most popular programming languages.
1. Python is a popular language for implementing all kinds of development projects, including automation tools and security tools, as well as malicious scripts.
1. Ruby is a dynamic, open source programming language with a focus on simplicity and productivity. It has an elegant syntax that is natural to read and easy to write.

An employee is attempting to install new software they believe will help them perform their duties faster. When the employee tries to install the software, an error message is received, stating they are not authorized to install the software. The employee calls the help desk for assistance. Evaluate the principles of execution control to conclude what has most likely occurred in this scenario.

1. It is likely that the company is using allow list control, and the software is not on the approved allow list. Any software not listed will be blocked from running.
1. If the company was using a block list, the software would be able to run as long as it is not on the prohibited list. Block list only blocks software that has been listed.
1. Allow list will not allow any software to run if it is not on the list. If the software was on the list, it would have been allowed to run.
1. Execution control only focuses on either the allow list or the block list, and does not scan for viruses or malicious software.

Which type of attack disguises the nature of malicious input, preventing normalization from stripping illegal characters?

1. Normalization means that a string is stripped of illegal characters or substrings, and converted to the accepted character set. This ensures that the string is in a format that can process correctly by the input validation routines. An attacker may use a canonicalization attack to disguise the nature of malicious input.
1. Fuzzing is a means of testing that an application's input validation routines work well. The test, or vulnerability scanner, generates large amounts of deliberately invalid and random input and records the application's responses.
1. Code reuse occurs through the use of a block of code from elsewhere in the same application, or from another application, to perform a different function.
1. Code signing is the principal means of proving the authenticity and integrity of code.

A threat actor programs an attack designed to invalidate memory locations to crash target systems. Which statement best describes the nature of this attack?

1. Dereferencing occurs when a pointer variable stores a memory location, which is attempting to read or write that memory address via the pointer. If the memory location is invalid or null, this creates a null pointer dereference type of exception and the process may crash.
1. Dereferencing does not mean deleting or removing; it means read or resolve.
1. A null pointer might allow a threat actor to run arbitrary code. Programmers can use logic statements to test that a pointer is not null before trying to use it.
1. A race condition is one means of engineering a null pointer dereference exception. Race conditions occur when processes depend on timing and order, and those events fail to execute in the order and timing intended.

A network user calls the help desk after receiving an error message. The caller complains that the error message does not indicate whether the username or password input was incorrect but simply states there was an authentication error. What does this situation illustrate?

1. Invalid user input can cause an error or exception. A structured exception handler (SEH) dictates what the application should then do. The application must not fail in a way that allows an attacker to execute code or perform some sort of injection attack.
1. Dynamic analysis tests the application under "real world" conditions using a staging environment.
1. Data exposure is a fault that allows privileged information (such as a token, password, or personal data) to be read without being subject to the appropriate access controls.
1. A web application can be designed to perform code execution and input validation. An example is a document object model (DOM) script to render the page using dynamic elements from user input.

Identify the type of attack that occurs when the outcome from execution process are directly dependent on the order and timing of certain events, and those events fail to execute in the order and timing intended by the developer.

1. Race conditions occur when the outcome from executive processes is directly dependent on the order and timing of certain events, and those events fail to execute in the order and timing intended by the developer.
1. A stack is an area of memory used by a program subroutine. It includes a return address which is the location of the program that called the subroutine. An attacker could use a buffer overflow to change the return address.
1. Integers are widely used as a data type, where they are commonly defined with fixed lower and upper bounds. An integer overflow attack causes the target software to calculate a value that exceeds these bounds.
1. A Dynamic Link Library (DLL) injection is not a vulnerability of an application but of the way the operating system allows one process to attach to another and then force it to load a malicious link library.

An attacker compromises a Linux host, installing a web shell as a backdoor. If the attacker gained access to the host through a connection the host established, what type of attack has occurred?

1. A reverse shell is a common attack vector against a Linux host, where a victim host opens a connection to the attacking host through a maliciously spawned remote command shell.
1. A man-in-the-browser (MitB) attack compromises the web browser. An attacker may be able to inspect session cookies, certificates, and data, change browser settings, perform redirection, and inject code.
1. Malware running with system or root level privilege is referred to as a rootkit, which gives an attacker unrestricted access to everything from the root of the file system down.
1. Session hijacking involves replaying a web application cookie in some way. Attackers can sniff network traffic to obtain session cookies sent over an unsecured network.

A system administrator suspects a memory leak is occurring on a client. Determine which scenario would justify this finding.

1. A memory leak is a process that takes up memory without subsequently freeing it up, which a worm or other type of malware can cause. Looking for decreasing available bytes and increasing committed bytes can detect this type of memory leak.
1. A rapid decrease in disk space is related to storage usage rather than memory usage. This may occur during data migration or archival.
1. High page file utilization occurs when there is insufficient physical memory to support multiple running applications. This could indicate the existence of malware.
1. High utilization out-of-hours can be suspicious if no scheduled activities are occurring, such as backup or virus scanning.

Which scenario best describes provisioning?

1. Provisioning is the process of deploying an application to the target environment. An enterprise provisioning manager might assemble multiple applications in a package. 
1. Deprovisioning is the process of removing an application from packages or instances. This might be necessary if software has to be completely rewritten or no longer satisfies its purpose. 
1. Version control is an ID system for each iteration of a software product. Most version control numbers represent both the version and internal build numbers for use in the development process. 
1. Continuous integration is the principle that developers should commit and test updates often—every day or sometimes even more frequently. This reduces the chances of two developers spending time on code changes that are later found to conflict with one another.










**Lesson 15**

A security professional is looking to harden systems at an industrial facility. In particular, the security specialist needs to secure an HVAC system that is part of an IoT network. Which areas does the specialist look to secure from data exfiltration exploits? **(Select all that apply.)**

1. A security specialist can incorporate fog nodes as a data processing layer positioned close to edge gateways, assisting the prioritization of critical data transmission. Fog nodes are high-value targets for both denial of service and data exfiltration attacks.
1. Edge gateways perform some pre-processing of data to and from edge devices to enable prioritization. They also perform the wired or wireless connectivity to transfer data to and from the storage and processing networks. Edge gateways are high-value targets to exploit.
1. Edge devices collect and depend upon data for their operation. In this case it would help to harden the HVAC devices or route to HVAC devices.
1. The cloud or data center provides the main storage and processing resources, plus distribution and aggregation of data. The IOT network is typically segmented from the main data center. 

A company has many employees that work from home. The employees obtain data and post data to a shared file they access through a link on the Internet. Consider the types of virtualization and conclude which the company is most likely utilizing.

1. Cloud computing is a service that provides on-demand resources such as server instances, data storage, databases, or applications. The service is typically provided over the Internet.
1. Resource pooling is described as the hardware making up the cloud provider's data center is not dedicated or reserved to a particular customer account.
1. Rapid elasticity refers to the cloud being able to scale quickly to meet peak demand.
1. Measured service is described as a cloud service in which the customer pays for the memory, disk, and the network bandwidth resources they are actually consuming rather than paying a monthly fee for a particular service level. This is known as a pay-per-use service. This service falls under the cloud computing type of virtualization.

A systems administrator configures several subnets within a virtual private cloud (VPC). The VPC has an Internet gateway attached to it, however, the subnets remain private. What does the administrator do to make the subnets accessible by the public?

1. The administrator must configure the Internet gateway as the default route for each public subnet. If the admin does not configure a default route, the subnet remains private, even if the VPC has an Internet gateway attached to it.
1. Connections to other services such as storage or services running in other VPCs are possible with VPC endpoint configurations.
1. While VPCs remain private from each other, the admin can create a CSP-managed feature or a VPN, to connect the VPCs and VPNs.
1. Multiple VPCs are not required. A VPC is an isolated virtual cloud that can contain many subnets.

Analyze and select the accurate statements about threats associated with virtualization. **(Select all that apply.)**

1. Virtual Machine (VM) escaping refers to malware running on a guest Operating System (OS) jumping to another guest or to the host.
1. A timing attack occurs by sending multiple usernames to an authentication server and measuring the server's response times.
1. Hypervisors are a common target of attacks and become more complex when the network infrastructure, such as switches and routers, is also virtualized. When the network infrastructure is implemented in software, it may not be subject to inspection and troubleshooting by system administrators.
1. VMs providing front-end, middleware, and back-end services should be separated to different physical hosts. This reduces the security implications of a VM escaping attack on a host in the Demilitarized Zone (DMZ).

A large sales organization uses a cloud solution to store large amounts of data. One afternoon, the data becomes inaccessible due to an outage at a data center. Which replication service level is currently in use?

1. A local replication solution replicates data within a single data center in the region that created the storage account. If the data center experiences an outage, so do all of the replicated copies.
1. A regional replication solution (also called zone-redundant storage) replicates data across multiple data centers within one or two regions.
1. A Geo-redundant storage (GRS) solution replicates data to a secondary region that is distant from the primary region. Cross-country or around the globe are other terms for this type of solution.
1. A zone is a portion of a region that performs replication.

A developer considers using an API for service integration and automation. If choosing Representational State Transfer (REST) as the API, which features can the developer expect? **(Select all that apply.)**

1. Requests sent as Simple Object Access Protocol (SOAP) must be in a correctly formatted XML document. However, with Representational State Transfer (REST) requests, they can be submitted as an HTTP operation/verb (GET or POST for example).
1. Representational State Transfer (REST) is a looser architectural framework, also referred to as RESTful APIs. SOAP is a tightly specified protocol.
1. Simple Object Access Protocol (SOAP) uses XML format messaging and has a number of extensions in the form of Web Services (WS) standards.
1. Simple Object Access Protocol (SOAP) also has built-in error handling and supports common features, such as authentication, transport security, and asynchronous messaging.

A systems administrator deploys a cloud access security broker (CASB) solution for user access to cloud services. Evaluate the options and determine which solution may be configured at the network edge and without modifying a user's system.

1. A reverse proxy (positioned at the cloud network edge) directs traffic to cloud services if the contents of that traffic comply with policy. This does not require configuration of users' devices.
1. Single sign-on authentication and enforcing access controls and authorizations from the enterprise network to the cloud provider is a feature of a CASB.
1. Rather than placing a CASB appliance or host inline with cloud consumers and the cloud services, an API-based CASB brokers connections between the cloud service and the cloud consumer.
1. A forward proxy is a security appliance or host, positioned at the client network edge, that forwards user traffic to the cloud network if the contents of that traffic comply with policy. This requires configuration of users' devices.

A company has recently started using a Platform as a Service (PaaS). Compare cloud service types to determine what is being deployed.

1. Platform as a service (PaaS) provides resources somewhere between SaaS and IaaS. A typical PaaS solution would provide servers and storage network infrastructure (as per IaaS) but also provide a multi-tier web application/database platform on top.
1. IaaS is a means of provisioning resources such as servers, load balancers, and Storage Area Network (SAN) components quickly.
1. SaaS is a different model of provisioning software applications. Rather than purchasing software licenses for a given number of seats, a business can access software hosted on a supplier's servers on a pay-as-you-go or lease arrangement.
1. Managed Security Services Provider (MSSP) is a means of fully outsourcing responsibility for information assurance to a third party.

A company conducts file sharing via a hosted private cloud deployment model. Which scenario accurately depicts this type of file sharing?

1. A third party hosts a hosted private cloud deployment model for the exclusive use of the organization. This service is more secure and provides guaranteed performance but is more costly than other options.
1. A third party hosts a public cloud deployment model and shares it with other subscribers. This is the most known form of cloud computing and is the least secure.
1. A private cloud is completely private to and owned by the company that uses it. This is geared toward companies and services that require strict control, such as banking or government entities.
1. Several organizations use a community cloud that shares the costs of either a hosted private or fully private cloud. This is usually done in order to pool resources for a common concern, such as standardization and security policies.

A security team suspects the unauthorized use of an application programming interface (API) to a private web-based service. Which metrics do the team analyze and compare to a baseline for response times and usage rates, while investigating suspected DDoS attacks? **(Select all that apply.)**

1. The number of requests is a basic load metric that counts the number of requests per second or requests per minute. Depending on the service type, admin can set a baseline for typical usage.
1. Latency is the time in milliseconds (ms) taken for the service to respond to an API call. This can be measured for specific services or as an aggregate value across all services.
1. Error rates measure the number of errors as a percentage of total calls, usually classifying error types under category headings.
1. Admin can manage unauthorized and suspicious endpoint connections to the API in the same sort of way as remote access.

An engineer uses an abstract model that represents network functionality. Using infrastructure as code to deploy and manage a network, how does the engineer make control decisions?

1. When using an abstract model, the engineer can divide the network functions into three "planes." The control plane makes decisions about how to prioritize and secure traffic, as well as where to switch it.
1. A software-defined networking (SDN) application can manage the aspects of all "planes" in the abstract model. SDN can manage compatible physical appliances, but also virtual switches, routers, and firewalls.
1. The management plane monitors traffic conditions and the overall network status.
1. The data plane handles the actual switching and routing of traffic and the imposition of security access controls.

What actions are typically recommended when securing virtualized and cloud-based resources? **(Select all that apply.)**

1. Virtual Machine (VM) software, hosts and guest Operating Systems (OS) should be patched on regular intervals. Regular patching provides fixes for identified vulnerabilities.
1. Virtual networking devices should be configured to support isolated communications wherever necessary. This will allow communications with the necessary clients.
1. Virtual machines should log all critical events versus all events. Logging all events will be counterproductive as critical events could be missed due to too much data.
1. The principle of least privilege for access to virtual machines should be utilized for security purposes. Most privilege would not maximize security for virtualized or cloud-based resources.

A startup designs a new online service and uses a serverless approach for some business functions. With this approach, how does the startup perform these functions? **(Select all that apply.)**

1. When an operation needs processing, by using a container, the cloud spins up the container to run the code, performs the processing, and then destroys the container.
1. A virtual machine is a full-fledged operating system that runs in a virtual environment and considered a server, not serverless. Serverless refers to creating and using containers when needed.
1. A single service would provide a specific output. Many services require working together in a serverless environment.
1. Serverless architecture depends heavily on the concept of event-driven orchestration with many services involved to facilitate operations.

An organization plans a move of systems to the cloud. In order to identify and assign areas of risk, which solution does the organization establish to contractually specify cloud service provider responsibilities?

1. It is imperative to identify precisely which risks are transferring to the cloud, which risks the service provider is undertaking, and which risks remain with the organization. A service level agreement (SLA) outlines those risks and responsibilities.
1. A trust relationship simply defines the relationship with a cloud service provider. The more important the service is to a business, the more risk the business invests in that trust relationship.
1. A responsibility matrix is a good way to identify what risks exist, and who is responsible for them. The matrix can be part of an SLA.
1. High availability is an approach to keeping systems functionality at a constant.

When provisioning application services in network architecture, an engineer uses a microservices approach as a solution. Which principle best fits the engineer's implementation?

1. Microservice-based development uses a philosophy that each program or tool should do one thing well. Each microservice should be capable of developing, testing, and deploying independently, and said to be highly decoupled, rather than just loosely decoupled.
1. Service-oriented architecture (SOA) conceives of atomic services closely mapped to business workflows. Each service takes defined inputs and produces defined outputs.
1. Services integration refers to ways of making these decoupled service or microservice components work together to perform a workflow.
1. Orchestration performs a sequence of automated tasks. Orchestrated steps run numerous automated scripts or API service calls.









**Lesson 16**

Analyze and determine the role responsible for managing the system where data assets are stored, and is responsible for enforcing access control, encryption, and backup measures.

1. A data custodian is responsible for managing the system where data assets are stored, including responsibility for enforcing access control, encryption, and backup or recovery measures.
1. A data owner has the ultimate responsibility for maintaining the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the information asset.
1. The data steward is primarily responsible for data quality, such as ensuring data is labeled and identified with appropriate metadata.
1. The privacy officer is responsible for oversight of any Personally Identifiable Information (PII) assets managed by the company and ensures that the processing and disclosure of PII comply with the legal and regulatory frameworks.

A document contains information about a company that is too valuable to permit any risks, and viewing is severely restricted. Analyze levels of classification and determine the appropriate classification for the document.

1. Documents labeled as critical contain information that is too valuable to permit any risk of its capture, and viewing is severely restricted.
1. Documents labeled as confidential contain information that is highly sensitive and is for viewing only by approved persons within the organization or possibly by third parties under a Nondisclosure Agreement (NDA). This classification may also be called low.
1. Documents labeled as classified contains information that limits viewing by only persons within an organization or by third parties that are under an NDA. This classification may also be called private, restricted, internal use only, or official use only.
1. Unclassified documents are unrestricted and anyone can view the document. This document does not contain information that will harm the company if released. This classification is also known as public.

A new cloud-based application will replicate its data on a global scale, but will exclude residents of the European Union. Which concerns should the organization that provides the data to consumers take into consideration? **(Select all that apply.)**

1. Data sovereignty refers to a jurisdiction preventing or restricting processing and storage from taking place on systems that do not physically reside within that jurisdiction.
1. Storage locations might have to be carefully selected to mitigate data sovereignty issues. Most cloud providers allow a choice of data centers for processing and storage.
1. GDPR protections extend to any EU citizen while they are within EU or EEA (European Economic Area) borders.
1. There are important institutional governance roles for oversight and management of information assets within a data life cycle. These roles help to manage and maintain data.

Choose which of the following items classify as Personally Identifiable Information. **(Select all that apply.)**

1. A full name can be used to identify, contact, or locate an individual. A full name is an identifier and can be used to search for a person to locate more PII that can be used to contact or locate a person.
1. A date of birth can be used to identify, contact, or locate an individual. This information is often used when verifying identity and may be used by an attacker to obtain unauthorized access into accounts and obtain other PII.
1. A job position is not considered PII. The position is not considered a person and is typically categorized as public information. Having the sole information of the name of a job position does not arm an attacker with the ability to identify, contact, or locate an individual.
1. Gender is not considered PII and is not unique to an individual. This information will not assist an attacker with contacting, identifying, or locating an individual.

An organization suspects that a visitor is performing data exfiltration while on the premises. The organization knows that the visitor does not have access to any computer system. Which of the following methods does the organization suspect the visitor of using? **(Select all that apply.)**

1. Data exfiltration can happen by communicating information orally over a telephone, cell phone, or Voice over IP (VoIP) network. Cell phone text messaging is another possibility.
1. Copying the data to removable media or other devices with storage, such as USB drive, the memory card in a digital camera, or a smartphone is not possible as the visitor has no access to computer systems.
1. Using a network protocol, such as HTTP, FTP, SSH, email, or remote access is useful for data exfiltration. Remote access is not possible as the visitor has no access to computer systems.
1. A camera can capture images or video of data. This data may be computer data. Since the visitor has no access to computer systems, other targets may be paper documents, post-it notes on desks, building layouts, and more.

A network manager assists with developing a policy to protect the company from data exfiltration. The employee devises a list of focus points to include. Which plans, when consolidated, provide the best protection for the company? **(Select all that apply.)**

1. Employees need training in document confidentiality and how to use encryption to store and transmit data securely. Annual refresher training will remind employees of its importance.
1. One mechanism for data exfiltration is by copying data to removable media or other device storage, such as USB drives or memory cards. Limiting the use of these to company property and only for job-related tasks helps reduce this risk.
1. Always encrypt sensitive data at rest. Transferring data outside of the network will likely be useless without the decryption key.
1. Offsite backups are the most secure for data that may be targeted for destruction or ransom. The data will remain on site, but the backups are offsite and provide redundancy for the company in the event of destruction or ransom demands.

Data exists in several states, each requiring different security considerations. Evaluate the following items and select which data state presents the greatest risk.

1. Data in use is when data is present in volatile memory. When a user works with data, that data needs to be decrypted, which puts it at risk.
1. Transmitting data over a network refers to data in transit. The encryption challenge is not as great as with data in use.
1. Data in motion is another name for data in transit.
1. When data is at rest, it is usually possible to encrypt the data using a variety of techniques, such as whole disk encryption, database encryption, and file- or folder-level encryption.

A company utilizing formal data governance assigns the role of data steward to an employee. Evaluate the roles within data governance and conclude which tasks the employee in this role performs.

1. The data steward is primarily responsible for data quality. This involves tasks such as ensuring data is labeled and identified with appropriate metadata, and data is collected and stored in a format with values that comply with applicable laws and regulations.
1. A privacy officer is responsible for oversight of any Personally Identifiable Information (PII) assets managed by the company. This includes ensuring that the processing and disclosure of PII comply with legal and regulatory frameworks.
1. The data custodian is responsible for managing the system where data assets are stored. This includes responsibility for enforcing access control, encryption, and recovery measures.
1. The data owner is a senior role with ultimate responsibility for maintaining the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the information asset. The owner is responsible for labeling the asset and ensuring it is protected with appropriate controls.

An employee is working on a project that contains critical data for the company. In order to meet deadlines, the employee decides to email the document containing the data to their personal email to work on at home. Consider the traits of Data Loss Prevention (DLP) and evaluate the scenario to select the DLP remediation the company should utilize.

1. The best solution for the company in this scenario is to block the email from sending the file to the personal email account. This action protects the data and notifies the user of the policy violation. It is likely that user training is needed so that the employee is aware of the policy and the reasons why the policy is in place.
1. If an alert only remediation is used for this scenario the data is in danger of being compromised. A personal email will not provide protection and will be vulnerable to attack. This action is not in the best interest of the company.
1. Quarantine will prohibit employees from accessing the file and will reduce work output. The policy violation was not malicious and the intent was not to harm the company.
1. The tombstone remediation technique is one step further from quarantine and is also not conducive to the workflow of the company. The block technique will still create the alert, notify administrators, and allow for retraining the employee without stopping workflow.

Analyze the features of Microsoft's Information Rights Management (IRM) and choose the scenarios that accurately depict IRM. **(Select all that apply.)**

1. A benefit of IRM is that file permissions can be assigned for different document roles, such as author, editor, or reviewer. Each role can have specific access such as sending, printing, and editing.
1. Printing and forwarding of documents can be restricted even when the document is sent as a file attachment. This means that just because a document is forwarded it may not have printing capabilities.
1. Printing and forwarding of email messages can be restricted.
1. One disadvantage is that a document protected with IRM is not immune to screen captures. These captures can be done with a camera phone, third party software, or a workaround using an Apple system.











**Lesson 17**

The IT team at a company discovers that a Windows server is infected with malware. As a result, the server is not functioning properly. Which event log does the team review to find errors from failing services related to newly installed software?

1. On a Windows system, the application event logs record events generated by applications and services, such as when a service run by a third-party application cannot start.
1. On a Windows system, the setup log contains events generated during the installation of the Windows operating system (OS).
1. Security event logs on a Windows system record and reveal audit events, such as a failed logon or access to a file being denied.
1. The system event logs on a Windows system include events generated by the operating system and its services, such as storage volume health checks.

An administrator uses data from a Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) system to identify potential malicious activity. Which feature does the administrator utilize when implementing rules to interpret relationships between datapoints to diagnose incidents?

1. Correlation means interpreting the relationship between individual data points to diagnose incidents of significance to the security team. A SIEM correlation rule is a statement that matches certain conditions.
1. A SIEM can enact a retention policy to keep historical log and network traffic data for a defined period. This allows for a retrospective incident and threat hunting.
1. Trend analysis is the process of detecting patterns or indicators within a data set over a time series and using those patterns to make predictions about future events.
1. A baseline is a point of reference that provides a record of settings and configurations for comparison purposes.

A user calls the help desk to report that Microsoft Excel continues to crash when used. The technician would like to review the logs in an attempt to determine the cause. Analyze the types of logs to determine which would contain the information the technician needs.

1. An event log records events that occur within an operating system or a software application. These logs diagnose errors and performance problems.
1. An audit log records the use of system privileges, such as creating a user account or modifying a file. Security logging needs to be configured carefully as over-logging can reduce the effectiveness of auditing by obscuring genuinely important events with thousands of routine notifications.
1. A security log is another way of describing an audit log. The audit log in Windows Event Viewer is called the Security log.
1. An access log is for server applications, such as Apache, which can log each connection or request for a resource.

A security expert needs to review systems information to conclude what may have occurred during a breach. The expert reviews NetFlow data. What samples does the expert review?

1. A flow collector is a means of recording metadata and statistics about network traffic rather than recording each frame. Network traffic and flow data may come from a wide variety of sources.
1. A SIEM collects data from sensors. The information captured from network packets can be aggregated and summarized to show overall protocol usage and endpoint activity.
1. sFlow, developed by HP and subsequently adopted as a web standard, uses sampling to measure traffic statistics at any layer of the OSI model for a wide range of protocol types.
1. If one has reliable baselines for comparison, bandwidth usage can be a key indicator of suspicious behavior. Unexpected bandwidth consumption could be evidence of a data exfiltration attack.

A security team desires to modify event logging for several network devices. One team member suggests using the configuration files from the current logging system with another open format that uses TCP with a secure connection. Which format does the team member suggest?

1. Rsyslog can work over TCP and use a secure connection. It uses the same configuration file syntax as Syslog. Rsyslog can use more types of filter expressions in its configuration file to customize message handling.
1. Syslog-ng is an update to Syslog that can use TCP secure communications, but it uses a different configuration file syntax than Syslog.
1. Syslog provides an open format, protocol, and server software for logging event messages. A very wide range of host types use Syslog, as well as UDP for communications.
1. NXlog is an open-source log normalization tool. One common use for it is to collect Windows logs, which use an XML-based format and then normalize them to a standard syslog format.

An engineer needs to review systems metadata to conclude what may have occurred during a breach. The first step the engineer takes in the investigation is to review MTA information in an Internet header. Which data type does the engineer review?

1. An email's Internet header contains address information for the recipient and sender, plus details of the servers or message Transfer Agents (MTA) handling transmission of the message between them.
1. When a client requests a resource from a web server, the server returns the resource plus headers setting, or describes its properties.
1. File metadata is stored as attributes. The file system tracks when a user creates, accesses, and modifies a file. The user might assign a file with a security attribute, such as marking it as read-only or as a hidden or system file.
1. Mobile phone metadata comprises call detail records (CDRs) of incoming, outgoing, and attempted calls and other data, such as SMS text time.

When endpoint security experiences a breach, there are several classes of vector to consider for mitigation. Which type relates to exploiting an unauthorized service port change?

1. Configuration drift applies when malware exploits an undocumented configuration change (shadow IT software or an unauthorized service/port, for instance).
1. A weak configuration is correctly applied, but exploited anyway. Review of the settings is recommended to ensure the highest level of security.
1. If endpoint protection/A-V, host firewall, content filtering, DLP, or MDM could have prevented an attack, then investigate the possibility of the lack of security controls.
1. Social engineering means that a user executed an exploit. Use security education and awareness to reduce the risk of future attacks succeeding.

The first responder to a security incident decides the issue requires escalation. Consider the following and select the scenario that best describes escalation in this issue.

1. Escalation is the process of involving additional senior staff to assist in incident management when the first responder feels the situation is too complex to manage alone.
1. “Pulling the plug” on an affected system is an option to contain an attack, but it is not the definition of escalation.
1. Although it is important to have access to legal expertise, who can evaluate the incident response from the perspective of compliance with laws and industry regulations, contacting the legal department is not an example of escalation.
1. The term escalation can describe when a user gains additional privileges without authorization. However, this is within the context of privilege management, not incident response.

A security analyst needs to contain a compromised system. The analyst would be most successful using which containment approach?

1. A simple option is to disconnect the host from the network completely (creating an air gap) or disabling its switch port. This is the least stealthy option and may reduce opportunities to analyze the attack or malware due to the isolation.
1. The analyst can implement a routing infrastructure to isolate one or more infected virtual LANs (VLANs) in a black hole that is not reachable from the rest of the network.
1. Segmentation-based containment is a means of achieving the isolation of a host or group of hosts using network technologies and architecture such as VLANs.
1. ACLs can prevent a host or group of hosts from communicating outside of a protected segment.

Arrange the following stages of the incident response life cycle in the correct order.

1. Stage 1. Preparation requires making the system resilient to attack in the first place (hardening systems, writing policies and procedures, and establishing confidential lines of communication).
1. Stage 2. Identification involves determining whether an incident has taken place and assessing how severe it might be, followed by notification of the incident to stakeholders.
1. Stage 3. Containment, Eradication, and Recovery are limiting the scope and impact of the incident. Once the incident is contained, the cause can then be removed and the system brought back to a secure state.
1. Stage 4. Lessons learned consists of analyzing the incident and responses to identify whether procedures or systems could be improved. It is imperative to document the incident.


A system compromise prompts the IT department to harden all systems. The technicians look to block communications to potential command and control servers. Which solutions apply to working with egress filtering? **(Select all that apply.)**

1. A recommended filtering approach would be to restrict DNS lookups to an ISP's DNS services or authorized public resolvers, such as Google's, helps to prevent lookups of malicious hosts.
1. A recommended filtering approach would be to allow only authorized application ports and, if possible, restricting the destination addresses to authorized Internet hosts helps to avoid contact with malicious servers.
1. Data loss prevention (DLP) pertains to protecting sensitive information by mediating the copying of tagged data to restrict it to authorized media and services.
1. If an attacker has managed to install a root certificate on a system, the attacker can make malicious hosts and services seem trusted. Admin must remove suspicious root certificates from the client's cache. This is not an egress filtering solution.

Successful adversarial attacks mostly depend on knowledge of the algorithms used by the target AI. In an attempt to keep an algorithm secret, which method does an engineer use when hiding the secret?

1. Algorithm secrecy is secrecy by obscurity (hiding). This approach can partially mitigate risks from less motivated threat actors, who will simply move to the next, easier target.

1. Engineers use Artificial Intelligence (AI)-type systems extensively for user and entity behavior analytics (UEBA).

A systems administrator suspects that a virus has infected a critical server. In which step of the incident response process does the administrator notify stakeholders of the issue?

1. In the identification phase, it is important to determine whether an incident has taken place, assess how severe it might be (triage), and notify stakeholders.
1. The recovery phase reintegrates the system into the environment and may involve the restoration of data from backup and security testing. The systems administrator must monitor the systems more closely for a period to detect and prevent any reoccurrence of the attack.
1. The containment phase aims to limit the scope and magnitude of the incident. The goal is to secure data while limiting the immediate impact on customers and business partners.
1. In the eradication phase, the admin removes the cause and restores the system to a secure state by applying secure configuration settings and installing patches.

An engineer creates a set of tasks that queries information and runs some PowerShell commands to automate several stages of the process, including the identification of threats and other malicious activity on multiple servers. The engineer defines these tasks using which of the following?

1. A runbook aims to automate as many stages of the playbook as possible, while leaving clearly defined interaction points for human analysis.
1. A playbook is a type of list usually referred to as an incident response workflow. A playbook is a checklist of actions to perform, to detect and respond to a specific type of incident.

Incident management relies heavily on the efficient allocation of resources. Which of the following factors should an IT manager consider as it relates to the overall scope of dealing with an incident? **(Select all that apply.)**

1. Downtime is a critical factor to consider to the degree to which an incident disrupts business processes. An incident can either degrade (reduce performance) or interrupt (completely stop) the availability of an asset, system, or business process.
1. Detection time is an important consideration requiring that the systems used to search for intrusions are thorough, and the response to detections must be fast.
1. Recovery time must be considered, as some incidents that need to have complex system changes require lengthy remediation. This extended recovery period should trigger heightened alertness for continued or new attacks.
1. Planning time can refer to the expected time for completing a project plan, or a period of time scheduled for an IT team to work together to plan out projects. It is not a consideration for incident remediation efforts.

During weekly scans, a system administrator identifies a system that has software installed that goes against security policy. The system administrator removes the system from the network in an attempt to limit the effect of the incident on the remainder of the network. Apply the Computer Security Incident Handling Guide principles to determine which stage of the incident response life cycle the administrator has entered.

1. The system administrator has entered the containment, eradication, and recovery stage by removing the system from the network. This action contains the incident and protects the other network resources. This is also the stage where the administrator will repair the system and bring it back online or replace it.
1. Preparation is the stage where the admin puts controls in place to prevent the software from being installed.
1. The identification stage was completed when the scan was conducted and the unauthorized software identified.
1. The lessons learned stage will occur after the containment, eradication, and recovery stage is completed and lessons learned will be utilized to improve the security of the network.

1. Artifacts refer to any type of data that is not part of the mainstream data structures of an operating system.


A systems breach occurs at a financial organization. The system in question contains highly valuable data. When performing data acquisition for an investigation, which component does an engineer acquire first?

1. The order of volatility outlines a general list of which components the engineer should examine for data. The engineer should first examine CPU registers and cache memory (including the cache on disk controllers and GPUs).
1. The engineer should acquire contents of nonpersistent system memory (RAM), including routing tables, ARP caches, process tables, and kernel statistics after any cache memory.
1. The engineer performs data acquisition on persistent mass storage devices after any available system caches or memory. This includes temporary files, such as those found in a browser cache.
1. The engineer performs data acquisition on persistent mass storage devices (such as HDDs or SSDs) after any available system caches or memory.

A systems breach occurs at a manufacturer. The system in question contains highly valuable data. An engineer plans a live acquisition, but ultimately, is not successful. What reason may be stopping the engineer?

1. A specialist hardware or software tool can capture the contents of memory while the host is running (live acquisition). This type of tool needs to be pre-installed or a standalone executable needs to be run, as it requires a kernel mode driver to dump any data of interest.
1. When a Windows host is in a sleep state, the system creates a hibernation file on disk in the root folder of the boot volume. This file is not a prerequisite for a live acquisition.
1. When Windows encounters an unrecoverable kernel error, it can write contents of memory to a dump file. This file is not a prerequisite for a live acquisition.

**Lesson 19**

Select the phase of risk management a company has performed if they analyzed workflows and identified critical tasks that could cause their business to fail, if not performed.

1. The first phase of risk management is to identify mission essential functions. Mitigating risk can involve a large amount of expenditure so it is important to focus efforts. Part of risk management is to analyze workflows and identify the mission essential functions that could cause the whole business to fail if they are not performed.
1. The second phase of risk management is to identify vulnerabilities for each function or workflow. This includes analyzing systems and assets to discover and list any vulnerabilities or weaknesses to which they may be susceptible.

A critical server has a high availability requirement of 99.99%. Solve the Maximum Tolerable Downtime (MTD) in hh:mm:ss to conclude which option will meet the requirement.

1. The Maximum Tolerable Downtown (MTD) metric states the requirement for a particular business function. High availability is usually described as 24x7. For a critical system, availability will be described from 99% to 99.9999%. In this scenario, the requirement is 99.99%, resulting in the maximum downtime of 00:52:34 (calculating MTD for a non-leap year: the total number of minutes is 365\*24\*60=525600, 0.01% of that is 52.56, 0.56 minutes is 33.6 seconds, resulting in 52 minutes and 34 seconds when rounded to the nearest second). Since 00:49:23 is less downtime than the maximum requirement, this results in the system meeting the requirement.
1. A downtime of 00:53:56 is more than the maximum annual downtime of 00:52:34. As a result, it is outside of the MTD.
1. A downtime of 01:24:19 is more than the maximum annual downtime of 00:52:34. As a result, it is outside of the MTD.
1. A downtime of 02:48:42 is more than the maximum annual downtime of 00:52:34. As a result, it is outside of the MTD.

1. The fifth phase of risk management is identifying risk response. A countermeasure should be identified for each risk and the cost of deploying additional security controls should be assessed.
1. The first phase of risk management is to identify mission essential functions. Mitigating risk can involve a large amount of expenditure, so it is important to focus efforts. Part of risk management is to analyze workflows and identify the mission essential functions that could cause the whole business to fail if they are not performed.
1. The second phase of risk management is to identify vulnerabilities for each function or workflow. This includes analyzing systems and assets to discover, and list any vulnerabilities or weaknesses they may be susceptible to.
1. The fourth phase of risk management is to analyze business impacts, the likelihood of a vulnerability being activated as a security incident by a threat, and the impact that incident may have on critical systems.

Management of a company identifies priorities during a risk management exercise. By doing so, which risk management approach does management use?

1. Risk posture is the overall status of risk management. Risk posture shows which risk response options management can identify and prioritize.
1. The result of a quantitative or qualitative analysis is a measure of inherent risk. Inherent risk is the level of risk before attempting any type of mitigation.
1. Transference means assigning risk to a third party, such as an insurance company or a contract with a supplier that defines liabilities.
1. Risk avoidance means that management halts the activity that is risk-bearing. For example, management may discontinue a flawed product to avoid risk.

Management of a company practices qualitative risk when assessing a move of systems to the cloud. How does the company indicate any identified risk factors?

1. Qualitative risk assessment uses categories or classifications such as Irreplaceable, High Value, Medium Value, and Low Value.
1. An Exposure Factor (EF) is the percentage of the asset value that would be lost in the event of an incident.
1. Annualized Loss Expectancy (ALE) is the amount that would be lost over the course of a year. To calculate the ALE, multiply the SLE by the Annualized Rate of Occurrence (ARO).

1. The Mean Time Between Failures (MTBF) represents the expected lifetime of a product and is for items that are repairable, such as a server.
1. Key Performance Indicators (KPI) determines the reliability of each asset. Main KPIs include MTBF and MTTR.
1. Mean Time to Failure (MTTF) represents the expected lifetime of a product and is for assets that are not repairable such as a hard drive.

A company has thirty servers that run for 125 hours, with three servers that fail. Rounding to the nearest whole number, calculate the Mean Time Between Failures (MTBF) for this scenario.

1. The calculation for Mean Time Between Failures (MTBF) is the total time divided by the number of total failures. In this scenario, the company has 30 servers that run for 125 hours (30x125), with the resulting product of 3,750. This result is then divided by the number of failures (3,750/3), which equals an MTBF of 1,250.
1. The calculation for Mean Time to Failure (MTTF) is the same test but divided by the number of devices. (30x125)/30, with a result of 125.
1. This answer choice (B) is derived by dividing the number of running hours by the number of systems. These two figures should be multiplied then divided by the failures for MTBF.
1. This answer choice (C) is the result prior to dividing by the number of failures. Dividing 3,750 by 3 will give the correct MTBF.

Select the example that provides an accurate simulation of a company engaging in the identifying threats phase of risk management.

1. The fourth phase of risk management is to analyze business impacts and the likelihood of a vulnerability being activated as a security incident by a threat and the impact of that incident on critical systems.














**Lesson 20**

An organization stores data in different geographic locations for redundancy. This data replicates so that it is the same in all locations. Engineers discover that some replicas are lagging with updates. What configuration do the engineers discover as the cause?

1. Asynchronous replication is not a good choice for a solution that requires data in multiple locations to be consistent. Asynchronous replication writes data to the primary storage first and then copies the data to the replicas at scheduled intervals. The engineers need to look into the schedules.
1. Synchronous replication writes data to all replicas simultaneously.
1. On-premises location refers to systems that are physically located at an organization's facility.
1. Cloud location refers to systems that are physically or virtually located at a cloud service provider rather than at an organization's facility.

A systems engineer reviews recent backups for a production server. While doing so, the engineer discovers that archive bits on files are clearing and incorrect backup types have been occurring. Which backup type did the engineer intend to use if the bit should not be cleared?

1. With a differential backup, all new and modified files since the last full backup are part of the backup set. With a differential backup type, the archive bit on a file is set to not cleared.
1. A full backup includes all selected data regardless of when the previous backup occurred. With a full backup type, the archive bit on a file is set to cleared.
1. Snapshots are a means of getting around the problem of open files when performing a backup. Snapshots use a copy of the data rather than the live data.
1. With an incremental type backup, new files, as well as files modified since the last backup are part of the backup set. With an incremental backup type, the archive bit on a file is set to cleared.

A systems engineer configures a disk volume with a Redundant Array of Independent Disks (RAID) solution. Which solution does the engineer utilize when allowing for the failure of two disks?

1. Redundant Array of Independent Disks (RAID) Level 6 has double parity or Level 5 with an additional parity stripe. This allows the volume to continue when two disks have been lost.
1. Level 1 uses mirroring where data is written to two disks simultaneously, which provides redundancy. The main drawback is its storage efficiency is only 50%.
1. RAID Level 0 is striping without parity resulting in no fault tolerance. Data is written in blocks across several disks.
1. RAID Level 5 has striping with parity. Data is written across three or more disks but calculates additional information. This allows the volume to continue if one disk is lost. This solution has better storage efficiency than RAID 1.

A recent systems crash prompts an IT administrator to perform recovery steps. Which mechanism does the administrator use to achieve nonpersistence?

1. Snapshot/revert to known state is a saved system state that the administrator can reapply to the instance on a system. This is a mechanism that achieves nonpersistence.
1. Configuration validation is a process that ensures that a recovery solution is working at each layer (hardware, network connectivity, data replication, and application).
1. Data replication is a process of reinstating data on a system. Nonpersistence would occur by separating any system restore from data replication.
1. Automation may restore a system as software may build and provision an instance according to any template instructions. This is a mastering instruction.

1. Change refers to control processes or management. Control involves careful planning, with consideration for how the change will affect dependent components.
1. Enterprise-level networks often provision resiliency at the site level. An alternate processing or recovery site is a location that can provide the same (or similar) level of service. Resiliency itself does not provide diversity.

A natural disaster has resulted in a company moving to an alternate processing site. The company has operations moved almost immediately as a result of having a building with all of the equipment and data needed to resume services. The alternative site was actively running prior to the natural disaster. Evaluate the types of recovery sites to determine which processing site the company is utilizing.

1. The company is utilizing a hot site for recovery. A hot site can failover almost immediately. The site is already within the organization's ownership and is ready to deploy.
1. A cold site takes longer to set up (up to a week) and does not have the equipment or data needed to set up immediately.
1. A warm site contains features of both hot and cold sites. An example of a warm site is a building with the computer equipment available, but the company must supply the latest data set to be operational.
1. Replication is the process of duplicating data between different servers or sites.

An organization configures both a warm site and a hot site for disaster preparedness. Doing so poses which difficulties for the organization? **(Select all that apply.)**

1. Creating a duplicate of anything doubles the complexity of securing that resource properly. Having multiple sites increases the complexity of the infrastructure.
1. Providing redundancy on a scale that includes multiple locations can be very expensive. Businesses often lease sites from service providers to reduce costs.
1. Enterprise-level networks often provision resiliency at the site level. An alternate processing or recovery site is a location that can provide the same (or similar) level of service.
1. Technology diversity refers to environments that are a mix of operating systems, applications, coding languages, virtualization solutions, etc. The diversity level should not change according to the number of sites as they are simply mirrored.

Analyze automation strategies to differentiate between elasticity and scalability. Which scenarios demonstrate scalability? **(Select all that apply.)**

1. Scalability is defined as the costs involved in supplying the service to more users is linear. For example, if the number of users doubles in a scalable system, the costs to maintain the same level of service would also double (or less than double). If costs more than double, the system is less scalable. A company that is hired to provide data processing for ten additional clients and has a linear increase in costs for the support is a scalable system.
1. A company that has a 10% increase in clients and a 5% increase in costs is highly scalable due to the cost increase being less than the client increase.
1. Elasticity refers to a system's ability to handle changes in demand in real time. A company that is hired to provide data processing for 10 additional clients and can utilize the same servers to complete the task is displaying elasticity.
1. A company that has a 10% increase in clients and a 10% decrease in server performance is demonstrating linear elasticity.

Management has reason to believe that someone internal to the organization is committing fraud. To confirm their suspicion, and to collect evidence, they need to set up a system to capture the events taking place. Evaluate which option will best fit the organization's needs.

1. A system that is placed on the network with the intent of attracting attackers or to detect internal fraud, snooping and malpractice is called a honeypot. This system will be placed within the current network.
1. An entire decoy network is called a honeynet. A honeynet can be an actual network or simulated.
1. An exploitation framework is a means of running intrusive scanning and uses the vulnerabilities identified by a scanner and launches scripts or software to attempt to exploit selected vulnerabilities.
1. Metasploit is the best-known exploit framework.

A company is working to restore operations after a blizzard stopped all operations. Evaluate the order of restoration and determine the correct order of restoring devices from first to last.

1. The order of restoration states that switch infrastructure, then routing appliances, followed by firewalls, and then Domain Name System (DNS) should be enabled in that order. The final step is to enable client workstations and devices.
1. The DNS should not be enabled prior to routers and firewalls. Both routers and firewalls are needed prior to DNS being operable.
1. Routers should be restored prior to firewalls. Routers should be restored immediately following switch infrastructure as firewalls are not needed until routers are online.
1. Client workstations should be restored last as firewalls and DNS must be restored prior to bringing the client workstations back online.


IT staff looks to provide a high level of fault tolerance while implementing a new server. With which systems configuration approach does the staff achieve this goal?

1. A system often achieves fault tolerance by provisioning redundancy for critical components and single points of failure. Although not required, a redundant component is available for system recovery.
1. Elasticity refers to the system's ability to handle any changes in resource demand in real-time. Elasticity often applies to processing power and storage.
1. A system achieves scalability by adding resources. To scale out is to add more resources in parallel with existing resources.
1. A system achieves scalability by adding resources. To scale up is to increase the power of existing resources.

A hurricane has affected a company in Florida. What is the first step in the order of restoration?

1. The first step in the order of restoration is to enable and test power delivery systems such as grid power, Power Distribution Units (PDUs), and secondary generators.
1. The second step in the order of restoration is to enable and test switch infrastructure, followed by routing appliances and systems.
1. The third step in the order of restoration is to enable and test network security appliances, such as firewalls and proxies.
1. The fourth step in the order of restoration is to enable and test critical network servers, such as directory services. The back-end and middleware will be next, followed by the front-end. The final step is to enable client workstations and devices.

Security specialists create a sinkhole to disrupt any adversarial attack attempts on a private network. Which solution do the specialists configure?

1. A popular disruption strategy is to configure a DNS sinkhole to route suspect traffic to a different network, such as a honeynet, where it can be analyzed.
1. Port triggering or spoofing can disrupt adversarial attacks by returning fake telemetry data when a host detects port scanning activity.
1. To create disruption for an adversary, a security specialist can configure a web server with multiple decoy directories or dynamically generated pages to slow down scanning.
1. Fake telemetry can disrupt an adversary by reporting IP addresses as up and available when they actually are not.

A system has a slight misconfiguration which could be exploited. A manufacturing workflow relies on this system. The admin recommends a trial of the proposed settings under which process?

1. Change management involves careful planning, with consideration for how the change will affect dependent components. For most significant or major changes, organizations should attempt to trial the change first.
1. The admin performs a change control process prior to the actual change. This process requests and approves changes in a planned and controlled way.
1. An asset management process tracks all the organization's critical systems, components, devices, and other objects of value in an inventory.
1. Configuration management ensures that each component of ICT infrastructure is in a trusted state that has not diverged from its documented properties.

A Redundant Array of Independent Disks (RAID) is installed with data written to two disks with 50% storage efficiency. Which RAID level has been utilized?

1. Redundant Array of Independent Disks (RAID) Level 1 uses mirroring where data is written to two disks simultaneously, which provides redundancy. The main drawback is its storage efficiency is only 50%.
1. RAID Level 0 is striping without parity resulting in no fault tolerance. Data is written in blocks across several disks.
1. RAID Level 5 has striping with parity. Data is written across three or more disks, but additional information is calculated. This allows the volume to continue if one disk is lost. This solution has better storage efficiency than RAID 1.
1. RAID Level 6 has double parity or Level 5 with an additional parity stripe. This allows the volume to continue when two disks have been lost.















**Lesson 21**

An organization plans the destruction of old flash drives. In an attempt to erase the media, an employee uses an electromagnet, only to discover that it did not destroy the data. Which method has the employee tried?

1. Degaussing involves exposing a magnetic hard disk to a powerful electromagnet. This disrupts the magnetic pattern that stores the data on the disk surface. Degaussing cannot erase non-magnetic disks, such as flash drives.
1. Pulping involves mixing any shredded remains of destroyed documents with water to provide an extra measure of protection.
1. Pulverizing involves destroying media by impact. It is important to note that hitting a hard drive with a hammer can actually leave a surprising amount of recoverable data. Industrial machinery should perform this type of destruction.
1. Burning or incineration is an effective method for all media types, as long as a furnace designed for media sanitization performs the task.

An engineer receives an alert from a mobile system equipped with an RFID tag. Upon investigating, the mobile system is missing from its assigned station. Which alarm type prompted the engineer to investigate?

1. A proximity alarm may use radio frequency ID (RFID) tags and readers that can track the movement of tagged objects within an area. This can form the basis of an alarm system to detect whether someone is trying to remove equipment.
1. Employees manually trigger a duress alarm if they come under threat. There are many ways of implementing this type of alarm. An automobile key fob with a panic button is an example of a duress alarm.
1. Linked to a detector, a motion-based alarm is triggered by any movement within an area (defined by the sensitivity and range of the detector).
1. A circuit-based alarm sounds when the circuit is opened or closed, depending on the type of alarm. A door or window opening or a fence being cut can trigger the alarm.

An organization plans the destruction of old HDDs. In an effort to save money, the organization damages the media by impact, but they did not destroy all of the data. Which method has the organization tried?

1. Pulverizing involves destroying media by impact. It is important to note that hitting a hard drive with a hammer can actually leave a surprising amount of recoverable data. Industrial machinery should perform this type of destruction.
1. Degaussing involves exposing a magnetic hard disk to a powerful electromagnet. This disrupts the magnetic pattern that stores the data on the disk surface.
1. Pulping involves mixing any shredded remains of destroyed documents with water to provide an extra measure of protection.
1. Shredders destroy documents. Some shredders are powerful enough to destroy optical media too. Industrial shredders can destroy hard drives and flash drives.

A project manager has designed a new secure data center and has decided to use multifactor locks on each door to prevent unauthorized access. Compare the following types of locks that the project manager may use to determine which example the facility is utilizing.

1. A multifactor lock is one that may combine different methods to enter, such as a smart card with a PIN.
1. A token-based lock is a smart lock that opens using a magnetic swipe card or features a proximity reader, to detect the presence of a wireless key fob or a one-time password generator.
1. An electronic lock operates by entering a PIN on an electronic keypad. A cipher, a combination, or keyless are other names for this type of lock.
1. A deadbolt is a bolt on the frame of the door, separate from the handle mechanism.


A secure data center has multiple alarms installed for security. Compare the features of the types of alarms that may be installed, and determine which is an example of a circuit alarm.

1. Circuit alarms sound when the circuit is opened or closed. This could be caused by a door or window opening.
1. A motion-based alarm is linked to a detector triggered by any movement within an area, such as a room.
1. Duress alarms are triggered manually by staff if they come under threat. There are many ways of implementing this type of alarm which include a panic button under a desk.
1. Pendants are also an example of a duress alarm. These can be pushed without alerting an intruder or attacker and will silently call for assistance.

A security team suspects that sensitive systems may have active wireless connections that are prone to eavesdropping. Which solution does the team secure the systems with to remedy the situation?

1. A faraday cage is an enclosure that features a charged conductive mesh that blocks signals from entering or leaving the area.
1. A vault is a room that is hardened against unauthorized entry by physical means, such as drilling or explosives.
1. Some data centers may contain racks with equipment owned by different companies (colocation). Technicians can install these racks inside cages so that they can only physically access the racks housing their own company's servers.
1. A physical DMZ is a location or an empty area surrounding a high-value asset, which security closely monitors for intrusions.

A project manager is developing a site layout for a new facility. Consider the principles of site layout design to recommend the best plan for the project.

1. The project manager should try to minimize traffic having to pass between zones. The flow of people should be in and out, rather than across and between.
1. Secure zones, such as equipment rooms, should be located as deep within the building as possible. External walls, doors, and windows should be avoided for these rooms.
1. Security mechanisms in public areas should be high visibility to increase deterrence. Use signs and warnings to enforce the idea that security is tightly controlled.
1. In secure zones, do not position display screens or input devices facing toward pathways or windows. Alternatively, use one-way glass so that no one can look in through windows.

Compare physical access controls with network security to identify the statements that accurately connect the similarities between them. **(Select all that apply.)**

1. Authentication creates access lists and identification mechanisms to allow approved persons through the barriers.
1. Authorization determines the barriers around a resource so that access can be controlled through defined entry and exit points.
1. An example of authentication is a user who logs into a network with a smart card. In terms of physical security, authentication is represented by an employee using a badge to enter a building.
1. An example of authorization is used to determine which files a user has on the network after authenticating. In physical security, the same can be said of the barriers in place to determine which employees can access a controlled room.

Which of the following are appropriate methods of media sanitization? **(Select all that apply.)**

1. There are several ways to perform media sanitization, defined as decommissioning various media, including hard drives, flash drives, and tape media. Data sanitization can be performed by overwriting old data on each location on the media using either zeroes or a random pattern.
1. Low-level format can be used to reset a disk to its factory condition. Most disk vendors supply tools to reset a disk and is often described as low-level format tools. It will have the same type of effect as disk wiping software.
1. A magnetic disk can be mechanically shredded or degaussed, exposing the disk to a powerful electromagnet. The machine used to perform this action is costly and will render the disk unusable, meaning it cannot be repurposed or resold.
1. Optical media cannot be reformatted. Discs should be destroyed before discarding. Shredders are available for destroying Compact Disks (CDs).

The security team at an organization looks to protect highly confidential servers. Which method does the team propose when protecting the servers against explosives?

1. A vault is a room that is hardened against unauthorized entry by physical means, such as drilling or explosives.
1. An air gapped host is one that is not physically connected to any network. Such a host would also normally have stringent physical access controls, such as housing it within a secure enclosure.
1. A faraday cage is an enclosure that features a charged conductive mesh that blocks signals from entering or leaving the area.
1. Some data centers may contain racks with equipment owned by different companies (colocation). Technicians can install these racks inside cages so that they can only physically access the racks housing their own company's servers.
