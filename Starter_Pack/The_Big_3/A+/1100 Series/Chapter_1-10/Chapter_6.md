- **Motherboards**
  - Foundation of the personal computer
  - Components plug into or connect indirectly to the motherboard
  - Contains wires (traces) that make up the system buses
  - Holds majority of ports for peripherals and distributes power from the power supply

- **Historical/Conceptual**
  - **How Motherboards Work**
    - Three defining characteristics: form factor, chipset, components
    - Chipsets typically from Intel or AMD, supporting CPU and RAM types
    - Form factor determines physical size and layout of components
    - Layers of PCB enable complex wiring without increasing board size

  - **Form Factors**
    - Industry-standardized shapes and layouts
    - AT, ATX, and ITX among common form factors
    - ATX became predominant due to more connectors and flexibility

  - **Chipset**
    - Handles CPU interfacing with other devices
    - Originally composed of northbridge and southbridge, now mostly integrated into CPU
    - Different chipsets offer support for various hardware options

- **Standard Components**
  - CPU socket and RAM slots
  - Ports for standard mass storage devices
  - Onboard sound, networking, and video support
  - RAID support, case fan connectors

- **Expansion Bus**
  - Connects expansion slots to CPU or chipset
  - PCI and PCIe slots for adding expansion cards
  - PCIe offers faster point-to-point serial connections, with varying lane configurations

- **Try This!**
  - Observe different motherboard form factors and features in a computer store
  - Familiarize with various expansion slots like PCI and PCIe

**Shopping Trip**
- Research higher-end motherboards online or at local computer stores
- Identify combinations of PCIe slots on single motherboards
- Compare specifications to find motherboard with most PCIe lanes
- Consider factors like compatibility, features, and performance

**Installing Expansion Cards**
- Four steps for successful installation: knowledge, physical installation, device drivers, verification
- Knowledge: Ensure compatibility with system and OS, check for proper drivers
- Physical Installation: Handle card carefully to avoid damage, insert firmly into available expansion slot
- Device Drivers: Install correct drivers, update if needed, uninstall old drivers if necessary
- Verification: Inspect installation, check Device Manager, test device functionality

**Upgrading and Installing Motherboards**
- Choose appropriate motherboard based on CPU, form factor, features, and compatibility
- Select compatible case that matches form factor and supports necessary components
- Gather necessary information and assess requirements before making recommendations
- Follow installation steps carefully, ensure proper mounting, and connect front panel wires accurately
- Test system functionality after installation, troubleshoot any issues encountered

- **Symptoms of Motherboard Failure:**
  - Catastrophic failure: Computer won't boot, accompanied by a pop sound and smell of ozone.
  - Component failure: Flaky connections or intermittent problems with devices.
  - Ethereal symptoms: Random failures like reboots or blue screens of death.

- **Troubleshooting Techniques:**
  - Isolate the problem by eliminating potential causes.
  - Use a modern POST card for diagnostic screening.
  - Employ a three-part system: check, replace, verify good component.
  - Document actions to avoid repetition and identify patterns.

- **Options for Fixing Motherboard Failures:**
  - Catastrophic failure: Replace the motherboard for stability.
  - Component failure: Replace the failed component with an add-on card.
  - Upgrade BIOS to address technology issues.
  - For ethereal problems, try flashing the BIOS or replacing the motherboard as last resorts.
