- Flash memory is used for data archiving, software distribution, and system backup.
- Flash memory comes in USB thumb drives and memory cards, suitable for various devices.
- USB thumb drives are hot-swappable and don't require an external power source.
- Memory cards include CompactFlash (CF) and Secure Digital (SD) cards, with various storage capacities and speeds.
- SD cards have different speed classes, including Speed Class, UHS Speed Class, and Video Speed Class.
- SD cards also have Application Performance Class ratings (A1 and A2) for smartphone usage.
- Card readers are required to access data on flash memory cards.

**Optical Media:**
- Optical discs include CDs, DVDs, and Blu-ray Discs, used for data storage and media playback.
- CD formats include CD-ROM, CD-R, and CD-RW, each with different write capabilities.
- DVD formats include DVD-ROM, DVD-R, DVD-RW, and DVD-RW DL, offering varying capacities and write capabilities.
- Blu-ray Disc formats include BD-ROM, BD-R, and BD-RE, with higher capacities and superior audio/video quality.
- Optical drives use interfaces like SATA for internal drives and USB/Thunderbolt for external drives.
- Blu-ray Disc players are commonly found in game consoles like Xbox One and PlayStation 3 or later.

**Installing Optical Drives:**
- Internal optical drives typically use SATA connections, while external ones use USB or Thunderbolt.
- Optical drives can be distinguished by their function stamped on the front or printed on a label.
- Most modern systems don't come standard with optical drives, but they can be custom-ordered or connected externally.
