- **CHAPTER 28: Operational Procedures**
  - **Introduction**
    - Operational procedures cover various aspects like safety, security risks, organizational policies, communication techniques, and professionalism.
    - Business continuity is essential for organizations to maintain operations amidst changes and disasters.
  - **Implementing Best Practices Associated with Documentation and Support Systems Information Management**
    - **Asset Management**
      - Involves tracking physical and virtual assets using methods like inventory lists, database systems, barcodes, and asset tags.
      - Procurement life cycle consists of phases like identifying needs, evaluating suppliers, negotiating terms, processing payment, delivery and audit, and maintaining records.
    - **Warranty and Licensing**
      - Tracking warranty and licensing documentation is crucial to ensure compliance and avoid penalties.
      - Assigned users are individuals authorized to use specific software products.
    - **Documentation for Policies, Procedures, Industry Standards, and Compliance**
      - Organizations should maintain documents outlining policies, procedures, industry standards, and compliance regulations.
      - Standard operating procedures (SOPs) ensure consistency, security, and regulatory compliance.
      - Acceptable use policies (AUPs) define permissible use of organizational resources.
    - **Network Topology Diagrams**
      - Diagrams illustrate how network components connect and function, aiding in troubleshooting and maintenance.
      - Compliance with regulatory requirements ensures workplace safety and adherence to laws.
      - Splash screens may be used to inform users about data privacy and terms of service.
    - **New-User Setup Checklist**
      - Ensures new employees have necessary equipment, access, and understanding of company policies.
    - **End-User Termination Checklist**
      - Facilitates the return of equipment, removal of network access, and knowledge transfer upon employee departure.
    - **Ticketing Systems**
      - Used for submitting and resolving technical assistance requests efficiently.
      - Include user information, problem description, progress notes, and resolution details.
      - Clear and concise communication is essential for effective ticket resolution.

- **Knowledge Base/Articles**
  - Organizations utilize documentation for cooperation and coordination among employees and departments.
  - Documentation aids in troubleshooting various issues from a tech's perspective.
  - Company knowledge base is crucial, comprising documents detailing equipment, encountered problems, and solutions, including third-party tech articles relevant to the organization's equipment.

- **Change-Management Best Practices**
  - CompTIA A+ techs offer valuable insights into change management based on their experiences.
  - Change can originate from both grassroots and top-down approaches.
  - Every organization has formal and informal change-management processes overseen by designated individuals.
  
- **Documented Business Processes**
  - Rollback Plan: Defined steps to return infrastructure to its pre-change state in case of failure.
  - Sandbox Testing: Isolated environment for experimenting with new or updated applications.
  - Responsible Staff Member: Oversees activities like rollback plans and change management.
  
- **Change-Management Process**
  - Request Forms: Initiate the change-management process by stating the problem, necessary fixes, and desired outcomes.
  - Determine the Purpose of the Change: Document the reasons behind proposed changes.
  - Determine the Scope of the Change: Define the affected systems, resources, and personnel.
  - Document the Date and Time of the Change: Establish clear timelines for implementation.
  - Determine Impact: Assess how the change will affect interconnected systems and users.
  - Analyze the Level of Risk: Evaluate potential problems and their impact on the change.
  - Change Board Approvals: Present documentation to a board for approval or further review.
  - Plan for the Change: Prepare resources, schedules, and contingencies for implementation.
  - End-User Acceptance: Educate end users on the need for change and how to adapt to new systems.

- **Environmental Impacts and Local Environmental Controls**
  - Temperature, Humidity, and Ventilation: Ensure proper environmental conditions for computer equipment.
  - Hazardous Materials: Understand and comply with regulations for handling dangerous substances.
  - Recycling E-Waste: Dispose of electronic components responsibly through recycling centers.
  
- **Prohibited Content/Activity and Privacy, Licensing, and Policies**
  - Data Classification: Categorize data based on sensitivity and retention requirements.
  - Regulated Data: Protect credit card transactions, personally identifiable information, and personal government-issued information in compliance with relevant laws and regulations.

- **Protected Healthcare Data**
  - PHI (Protected health information) includes health status, medical records, and healthcare services.
  - Like PII, PHI should never be shared without the owner's permission.

- **Compliance**
  - Members of an organization must abide by all applicable rules.
  - Compliance reduces support calls and helps focus on more serious issues.

- **Licensing, End-User License Agreement, and Digital Rights Management**
  - Software licensing varies from personal use to corporate use.
  - License validity, expiration, open source licenses, and EULA (End-User License Agreement) terms are important.
  - DRM (Digital Rights Management) controls software and media access.

- **Incident Response**
  - **First Response:**
    - Secure the area, determine scope, and analyze impact.
  - **Incident Reporting:**
    - Document and report incidents to supervisors for record and pattern recognition.
  - **Inform Management/Law Enforcement:**
    - Determine the incident's scope and seriousness, involving law enforcement if necessary.
  - **Chain of Custody:**
    - Establish a process for identifying, storing, and transferring evidence during an incident response.

- **Beyond A+**
  - Review and practice for the CompTIA A+ exams.
  - Consider further certifications like CompTIA Network+ and CompTIA Security+ for comprehensive tech skills.
