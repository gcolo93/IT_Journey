- **Chapter 22: Virtualization**
  - Introduction
    - Virtualization is a concept rather than a tangible object
    - Central idea: replacing existing components with a layer of software for flexibility
    - Virtual memory as an early example
  - Importance of Virtualization
    - Enables new capabilities and simplifies management
    - Introduction to cloud computing
  - **1101: Hardware Virtualization**
    - Definition and purpose
    - Hypervisor and virtual machines (VMs)
    - Example: Hyper-V running Linux and Windows 10
    - Importance in server environments
  - **Client-side Virtualization**
    - Supervisor's role in operating systems
    - Hypervisor's role in client-side virtualization
    - Hypervisor options: Hyper-V, Oracle VM VirtualBox, KVM, VMware
  - **Benefits of Virtualization**
    - Saving Resources
      - Consolidating multiple systems into one physical computer
      - Energy savings and reduced hardware maintenance
      - Examples: Windows user needing Linux access, support techs accessing multiple OS versions
    - Simplifying System Management and Security
      - Easy setup and management of VMs
      - Enhanced security through isolation and snapshots
      - Importance of regular security measures for VMs
  - **Purpose of Virtual Machines**
    - Sandboxing
      - Types of sandboxes and VM's role in isolation
    - Development Testing
      - Ensuring software compatibility across different systems
    - Application Virtualization
      - Virtualizing OS capabilities for application usage
  - **Creating a Virtual Machine**
