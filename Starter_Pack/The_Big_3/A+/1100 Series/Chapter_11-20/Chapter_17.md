- **Chapter 17: Display Technologies**
    - **Video Displays**
        - Three types: flat-panel displays, projectors, virtual reality headsets
        - Flat-panel displays are the most common
        - Projectors are used in boardrooms and classrooms
        - Virtual reality headsets use similar display panels
        - Technology variations and connection options discussed
    - **Flat-Panel Displays**
        - Majority of computing devices use flat-panel displays
        - Evolution from bulky CRT displays to LCD and OLED panels
        - LCD Panels:
            - Composed of liquid crystal molecules between polarizing filters
            - Different types: twisted nematic (TN), in-plane switching (IPS), vertical alignment (VA)
            - Backlights: LED technology replacing CCFL
        - OLED Panels:
            - Use organic compounds to emit light, no need for backlight
            - Expensive but offer superior contrast compared to LCD
    - **Projectors**
        - Generate images and project them onto a screen
        - Front-view projectors are common for presentations
        - Technologies: LCD and DLP
        - Key considerations: lumens, throw, light sources
    - **Common Display Features**
        - Connections: VGA, DVI, HDMI, DisplayPort, Thunderbolt, USB Type-C
        - Adjustments: On/Off button, OSD menu
        - VESA Mounts for wall or stand mounting
        - Add-on Features: USB hubs, speakers, webcams, microphones
    - **Display Adapters**
        - Graphics processor, video memory, integrated GPUs, connections
        - Graphics processors from NVIDIA, AMD, and Intel
        - Video memory types: GDDR, HBM
        - Integrated GPUs becoming more powerful, common in laptops

- **Connector Types and Associated Cables**
  - VGA
  - DVI
  - HDMI
  - DisplayPort
  - Thunderbolt (including mDP Thunderbolt 1 and 2 ports, and USB Type-C Thunderbolt 3 and 4 ports)
  - USB Type-C

- **Video Card Connectors**
  - Examples:
    - VGA
    - DVI-I
    - S-video
    - HDMI
    - DisplayPort
  - Some older cards may feature multiple connector types for various media devices like cameras, projectors, and TVs.

- **Installing and Configuring Video**
  - Considerations during physical installation:
    - Compatibility with case size and other components
    - Ventilation space for cooling
    - Power connector requirements
  - Midrange to high-end cards may require additional PCIe power connectors.
  - Tips for installation and troubleshooting.

- **Software**
  - Configuring video software:
    - Installing drivers
    - Display Settings and Personalization Settings in Windows
    - Display options in macOS and Linux

- **Troubleshooting Video**
  - Common issues and troubleshooting steps:
    - Checking monitor settings
    - Addressing audio issues
    - Cable and connection checks
    - Isolating problems between computer and display
    - Troubleshooting monitors: common problems and solutions
    - Dealing with high-resolution monitors: adjusting element size in Display Settings

- **Cleaning Monitors**
  - Avoid directly spraying liquid onto the screen to prevent damage to electronics.
  - Refrain from using cleaners, solvents, or prepackaged disposable wipes.
  - Start with a clean, dry microfiber cloth and gently wipe the screen.
  - If needed, dampen part of the cloth with water and continue gently wiping, then dry promptly.

- **Privacy with Multiple Monitors**
  - Consider privacy screens to limit wide-angle viewing and reduce glare from external objects.

- **Multiple Monitor Mishaps**
  - Ensure compatibility of monitors in terms of size, resolution, and orientation to avoid misalignment issues.
  - Properly designate monitor positions in Display Settings to prevent display extension errors.

- **Troubleshooting Projectors**
  - Allow projector lamps to cool before maintenance.
  - Keep spare lamps and batteries on hand for quick replacement.
  - Clean dust from fans, filters, and vents to prevent overheating and shutdowns.
  - Reboot the projector if it goes into sleep mode or displays no image.
  - Address incorrect color display or fuzzy images by cleaning the lens and adjusting settings.

- **Troubleshooting Video Cards and Drivers**
  - Identify and address bad or incompatible drivers causing issues like Blue Screen of Death.
  - Roll back or delete corrupted drivers in Safe mode and reinstall the correct ones.
  - Monitor for signs of failing components like fans or RAM, which can cause screen anomalies.

- **Evaluating Monitors**
  - Consider resolution, pixels per inch (PPI), brightness, viewing angle, response rate, refresh rate, contrast ratio, color depth, panel technology, and high dynamic range (HDR) when selecting a monitor.
  - Understand the significance of these properties for various user needs and budgets.

- **Additional Display Topics**
  - Stay informed about emerging display technologies such as microLED and external GPUs for future considerations in display selection and setup.
