- **Wireless Networking**
    - **Historical/Conceptual**
        - Wireless networks are popular and easy to configure but often lack understanding, which can hinder troubleshooting.
    - **Wireless Networking Components**
        - Wireless networks use radio waves instead of wires, with WLANs and Bluetooth being common technologies.
        - Wireless capabilities are built into many devices, and external adapters can also be used.
        - Wireless access points (WAPs) connect wireless devices to a wired network and may also function as switches and routers.
        - Power over Ethernet (PoE) allows a single cable to provide power and network connection to WAPs.
    - **Wireless Networking Software**
        - Wireless devices use the same networking protocols and operate using carrier sense multiple access/collision avoidance (CSMA/CA) scheme.
        - Wireless adapters are plug and play, but configuration utilities may be needed to set parameters.
    - **Wireless Infrastructure**
        - WAPs connect wireless devices to wired networks, with multiple WAPs forming an Extended Basic Service Set (EBSS) for larger areas.
        - Wireless repeaters/extenders can improve signal coverage, and mesh networks can dynamically route traffic.
    - **Wireless Networking Security**
        - MAC address filtering, authentication, and data encryption are used to secure wireless networks.
        - Changing default SSID and password, adjusting access point placement and radio power, and enabling guest networks are recommended security practices.
        - Wireless security protocols like WPA2 and WPA3 provide authentication and encryption.
    - **Wireless Networking Standards and Regulations**
        - IEEE 802.11 standards define methods for wireless communication, primarily using the 2.4 GHz, 5 GHz, and 6 GHz bands.
