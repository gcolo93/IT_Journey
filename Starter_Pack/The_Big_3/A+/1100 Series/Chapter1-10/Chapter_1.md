### Expectations and follow up ###

- Do what the customer is paying for.
- Give follow-up confirmation and guidance after the job is complete.
- Timeline
  - Customers appreciated if they are given a general idea of how long the work will take to complete. It is fine to hold off on the time frame prediction until you have run your diagnosis.

- **Electrostatic Discharge (ESD):**
  - Occurs when static electricity jumps improperly, potentially damaging devices.
  - Examples include lightning and ESD from human contact.
  - Can destroy sensitive computer parts.

- **Antistatic Tools:**
  - Electrostatic discharge (ESD) straps keep user and computer at the same electrical potential.
  - Antistatic mats eliminate static risk when handling components.
  - Antistatic bags prevent static damage during component storage.
  
- **Electromagnetic Interference (EMI):**
  - Magnetic fields interfering with electronics.
  - Can cause permanent damage or data loss in storage devices.
  - Avoid using magnets near computer equipment.

- **Radio Frequency Interference (RFI):**
  - Causes strange noises in speakers and cell phones.
  - Devices emitting radio waves include cell phones, wireless networks, and microwaves.
  - Shield devices from each other to prevent interference.

- **Physical Tools:**
  - Basic toolkit includes screwdriver, Torx wrench, nut driver, tweezers, grabber tool, and screwdrivers.
  - Specialized kits for mobile devices include spudgers and magnifying glasses.

- **Personal Safety:**
  - Stay organized to avoid tripping hazards.
  - Use proper lifting techniques for heavy boxes.
  - Beware of hot components and use caution when handling live systems.
  - Remove jewelry and secure loose clothing to prevent accidents.

- **Troubleshooting Methodology:**
  - Follows steps to diagnose and fix computer issues.
  - Includes identifying the problem, establishing a theory of probable cause, testing, implementing solutions, verification, and documentation.

- **Identify the Problem:**
  - Talk to users to understand the issue.
  - Ask about recent changes and environmental factors.
  - Consider backing up critical files before making changes.

- **Establish a Theory of Probable Cause:**
  - Analyze symptoms to develop a theory.
  - Conduct external or internal research if needed.

- **Test the Theory to Determine the Cause:**
  - Verify the theory through testing.
  - Replace broken parts if necessary.
  - Escalate if the issue is beyond skill level or permissions.

- **Establish a Plan of Action to Resolve the Problem:**
  - Develop a plan considering scope and permissions.
  - Refer to vendor instructions for specific equipment.

- **Verify and Prevent:**
  - Confirm the solution with the user.
  - Implement preventive measures if applicable.
  - Educate users to prevent future issues.

- **Document Findings, Actions, and Outcomes:**
  - Record troubleshooting history for future reference.
  - Helps track recurring problems and solutions.
  - Essential for incident reporting and knowledge sharing among techs.
