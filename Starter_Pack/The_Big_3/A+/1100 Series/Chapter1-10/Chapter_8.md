    - Types: HDDs and SSDs.
    - HDD Composition: Platters, read/write heads, actuator arms, and servo motor.
    - Spindle Speed: RPM and its impact on performance and lifespan.
    - Form Factors: 2.5-inch and 3.5-inch.
  - **Solid-State Drives**
    - Advantages over HDDs: Speed, durability, and lack of moving parts.
    - Form Factors: 2.5-inch, mSATA, and M.2.
    - Sizes and Designations: Width and length dimensions.
    - Technology: NAND flash memory.
    - Cost: Comparison with HDDs and types of memory technology.
    - Performance Variables: Sequential read/write, random read/write, and latency.
  - **Connecting Mass Storage**
    - Physical Connections: SATA, PATA, and their differences.
    - Protocols: ATA/ATAPI standards.
    - PATA: Cable types, connectors, revisions, and introduction of S.M.A.R.T.
    - SATA: Advantages over PATA, cable differences, throughput, and hot-swapping.
    - SATA Express (SATAe): Utilization of PCIe bus, performance enhancements, and connectors.
    - External Drives: eSATA and current use of USB and Thunderbolt ports.

- **Exam Tips**
  - Knowledge of IDE cables, Molex connectors, and cable lengths.
  - Understanding of SATA revisions, form factors, and performance metrics.
  - Awareness of advancements in external drive connectivity.

- **Refining Mass Storage Communication**
    - The original ATA standard defined specific commands for CPU to drive controller communication.
    - Current command sets: AHCI and NVMe.

- **AHCI**
    - Efficient SATA communication with Advanced Host Controller Interface (AHCI).
    - Supports native command queuing (NCQ) and hot-swapping.
    - Enabling AHCI at CMOS level unlocks features; enabling after OS installation causes issues.

- **Successfully Switching SATA Modes Without Reinstalling**
    - Steps for switching to AHCI in Windows without reinstalling.
    - Back up data, run elevated command prompt exercise, then change BIOS/UEFI settings.

- **NVMe**
    - Non-Volatile Memory Express (NVMe) enables direct OS-SSD communication through PCIe.
    - Supports high-speed SSDs with formats like M.2, offering faster speeds than AHCI.

- **Protecting Data with RAID**
    - RAID ensures data safety and improves speed.
    - RAID levels include RAID 0, 1, 5, 6, 10, and 0+1, each with different features.

- **SCSI**
    - SCSI used in server market, evolved from parallel to serial interfaces.
    - Serial Attached SCSI (SAS) provides fast, robust storage for servers.

- **Implementing RAID**
    - RAID methods enhance data redundancy and speed; can be hardware or software-based.
    - Thousands of RAID configurations possible; choice depends on RAID level, OS, and budget.

- **Dedicated RAID Boxes**
    - External RAID boxes add storage and backup options.
    - Support various RAID configurations for data safety and speed.

- **Installing Drives**
    - Choose appropriate drive, consider placement and connections.
    - Properly install drives, ensuring correct cabling and configuration.

- **BIOS Support: Configuring CMOS and Installing Drivers**
    - Configure hard drive controllers in CMOS; enable AHCI for best performance.
    - Troubleshoot drive installation using autodetection and CMOS setup.

- **Troubleshooting Hard Drive Installation**
    - Check BIOS recognition, physical connections, and controller settings.
    - Use CMOS setup to diagnose and resolve hardware configuration issues.
