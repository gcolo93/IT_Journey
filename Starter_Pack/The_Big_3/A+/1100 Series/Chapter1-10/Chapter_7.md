- **Power Supplies:**
  - Computers require electricity to operate.
  - Desktop computers use a power supply unit (PSU) to transform wall socket electricity into usable power.
  - Power supply issues can lead to system instability, crashes, and data loss.
  - Understanding electricity principles and variations of PC power supplies is crucial for techs.

- **Historical/Conceptual:**
  - **Understanding Electricity:**
    - Electricity is the flow of electrons through matter, similar to water flow in pipes.
    - Voltage (V) represents electrical pressure, while current (A) measures electron flow.
    - Power (W) is the product of voltage and current (V × A = W).
    - Wires have resistance (Ω), and conductors facilitate electron movement.
  - **Circuit Protection:**
    - Circuit breakers and ground wires protect against overload and provide a path for excess electricity.
    - Fuses and circuit breakers prevent overheating and electrical fires.
  - **AC and DC Electricity:**
    - Electricity comes in direct current (DC) and alternating current (AC) forms.
    - PCs use DC power, but power companies supply AC power for efficiency.

- **Powering the PC:**
  - **Supplying AC:**
    - Power supplies receive AC power from the wall socket.
    - Power cords connect the power supply to the electrical outlet.
    - Modern power supplies support dual voltage and autosensing.
  - **Testing Your Power Source:**
    - Multimeters or specialized devices test AC outlets for proper voltage and grounding.
  - **AC Adapters:**
    - AC adapters convert AC current to DC for devices.
    - Matching voltage, amperage, and polarity is crucial for compatibility.
    
- **Protecting the PC from Spikes and Sags in AC Power:**
  - **Surge Suppressors:**
    - Surge suppressors protect against voltage spikes and surges.
    - Joules rating and UL certification are important considerations.
    - Surge suppressors should also protect telephone and cable connections.
  - **Uninterruptible Power Supply (UPS):**
    - UPSs provide backup power during sags or outages.
    - UPS capacity is measured in watts and volt-amps (VA).
    - Different types of UPSs offer varying levels of protection and functionality.

- **Supplying DC**
  - The power supply unit converts AC electricity into usable DC voltages (3.3V, 5V, and 12V) for PC components.
  - Power supplies come in various shapes and sizes, with the standard size being 150 mm × 140 mm × 86 mm.
  - Different components within the PC utilize different voltages, with motors using 12V and onboard electronics using 3.3V and 5V.
- **Power to the Motherboard**
  - Modern motherboards use a 20- or 24-pin P1 power connector, with additional connectors sometimes required for extra power.
- **Power to Peripherals: Molex, Mini, and SATA**
  - Peripherals like hard drives and optical drives are powered by connectors such as Molex, mini, and SATA.
  - Molex connectors supply 5V and 12V, while mini connectors typically supply 5V and 12V to peripherals.
  - SATA power connectors support SATA drives with 15 pins.
- **Testing DC**
  - Techs commonly test DC voltages using a multimeter to ensure proper functionality.
  - Molex and P1 connectors are tested to ensure correct voltage outputs.
- **ATX**
  - ATX power supplies feature a 20- or 24-pin motherboard power connector and support soft power functionality.
  - Updates to ATX standards include ATX12V 1.3, EPS12V, multiple rails, and ATX12V 2.0.
- **Niche-Market Power Supply Form Factors**
  - Smaller and quieter PCs have led to the development of niche-market power supply form factors like Mini-ITX and microATX.
- **Active PFC**
  - Active power factor correction (active PFC) smoothens power coming from the wall to prevent harmonic damage.
- **Wattage Requirements**
  - Power supplies need to provide sufficient wattage to support all components in a system, with efficiency ratings provided by programs like 80 Plus.
- **Installing and Maintaining Power Supplies**
  - Power supplies are installed using standard screws and should be handled carefully, with ATX systems requiring the power to be unplugged before any work.
- **Cooling**
  - Power supply fans and case fans help regulate temperature within the PC, with case fans typically connecting to the motherboard for monitoring.

- **Maintaining Airflow:**
  - A closed computer case enables fans to create airflow, cooling off interior components efficiently.
  - Warm air rises, so positioning intake and exhaust fans accordingly helps in effective cooling.
  - Slot covers should cover empty expansion bays to maintain steady airflow and keep dust out.
  
- **Reducing Fan Noise:**
  - Manually adjustable fans or larger fans spinning slowly can reduce noise while maintaining airflow.
  - Motherboards often allow fan control through software, enabling automatic adjustment based on temperature.
  
- **Troubleshooting Power Supplies:**
  - Power supplies can fail suddenly or slowly over time, leading to various issues.
  - Testing power supply voltages using a multimeter can help diagnose issues.
  - An ATX power supply tester can also be used to check power supply functionality.
  
- **When Power Supplies Die Slowly:**
  - Intermittent problems may indicate a failing power supply, warranting replacement.
  - Symptoms of a failing power supply include booting issues, system errors, and intermittent lockups.
  
- **Fuses and Fire:**
  - Fuses blow for a reason, and attempting to replace them may be hazardous.
  - Electrical fires can occur due to malfunctioning power supplies, necessitating proper precautions.
  - Using the appropriate fire extinguisher type (Class C) is crucial in case of electrical fires.
  
- **Redundant Power Supplies:**
  - Redundant power supplies (RPS) ensure uninterrupted power supply by employing two identical power supplies.
  - Load balancing occurs when both power supplies share the electrical load, providing resilience against failure.
  
- **Modular Power Supplies:**
  - Modular power supplies allow users to connect only the necessary cables, reducing clutter and improving aesthetics.
  - While modular cables may slightly reduce efficiency due to added resistance, they offer a cleaner look.
