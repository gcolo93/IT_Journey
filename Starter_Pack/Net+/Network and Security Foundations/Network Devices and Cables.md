A **switch** is a data link layer device. It is available either as a standalone or integrated with other devices, such as wireless routers or modems that can plug in physical devices. A switch keeps the traffic between the source and destination ports from interfering with other devices in the network. (Data Link and Network Layer Device)

A **router** operates at the network layer and can connect your home network to the Internet. In a business scenario, a router can connect your web server to your database server. (Network Layer Device)

**Firewalls** can operate at multiple layers of the OSI model, including data link, network, transport, session, and application - and in certain circumstances, presentation as well.

At the data link and network levels the firewall defines what traffic should go between two networks.

At the transport layer, the firewall filter settings are port-based. You can also filter traffic using a range of ports or a combination of IP addresses and ports.

The firewall that operates at the network and transport layers is called the **Layer 4 firewall**, and the one that works at the sesion, presentation, and application layers is the **Layer 7 firewall**.

The Layer 7 firewall is also smart enough to decrypt and analyze the content flowing through, thereby adding one more level of filtering to the IP address and port combination.

Firewalls can be software devices that run inside a virtual machine or physical server or can also be hardware devices like Fortinet’s Fortigate device.

A **modem** is a device necessary for sending and receiving data. Modems allow computers to transport digital information over analog lines, such as phone or cable lines. Types of modems include cable modems, DSL modems, and satellite modems. (Physical and Data Link Layer Device)

A **router** is a point of connection between two or more networks that forwards data packets between the networks. To have internet in your home, you need an internet router that connects the networks on the internet to the network of your home. You can access the internet’s network either through a wired Ethernet port, or via Wi-Fi.

A **switch** is used to connect devices in a specific network and allows them to communicate efficiently within the network. A switch is a more complex version of a hub, in that switches have the capability to add security measures and function far more intelligently, sending traffic directly from the sender to the receiver without the other devices being aware of the communication. Thus, a switch is less chatty and allows for more simultaneous conversations between devices. Most internet routers include a switch in the form of wired and wireless Ethernet connections.

A **bridge** is similar to a router in that it connects two or more networks. The difference is that a router analyzes data packets to determine where to send the packet next, whereas a bridge simply forwards the data to the next network without analysis. This makes for fast data transfer that lacks versatility. Bridges are not widely used in modern networks, as routers and switches are the favored devices. (Network Layer Device)

A **repeater** is a device used to strengthen, replicate, and regenerate signals that are weakened (for example, because of distance) during transmission. In many large homes, the Wi-Fi signal does not extend to the end of the house farthest from the router. A range extender is a form of repeater that takes the distorted Wi-Fi signal and transmits it to the formerly dead zone. (Physical Layer Device)

A **hub** connects the router to the network, takes the data packets from the router, and sends them to all the devices connected on the network. An example is a USB hub. By connecting a USB hub to your computer, data packets are able to be transferred to multiple devices connected to your computer; each device then looks at only the traffic destined for it and ignores the rest. (Physical Layer Device)

The least expensive and most common type of cable is the **unshielded twisted pair (utp).**

**Shielded twisted pair (stp)** has an extra shielding to prevent the leakage of electrical noise from one wire to another.

**UTP cables** come in six different standard types as defined by TIA/EIA 568. You can identify the type of cable you have by looking at the writing on the cable itself.

- **Cat3** supports up to 10 Mbps for up to 100 meters and is commonly used for phone lines today.
- **Cat4** supports 16 Mbps for up to 100 meters and is not commonly used today.
- **Cat5** is used in Ethernet LANs containing two twisted pairs allowing for up to 100 Mbps up to 100 meters between the device and the switch, hub, or router. This has been practically replaced by the Cat5e specification.
- **Cat5e** doubles the number of twisted pairs to four for up to 1 Gbps over up to 100 meters.
- **Cat6** is also used in Ethernet LANs and data centers. Cat6 is made up of four tightly woven twisted pairs (more twists per linear foot) and supports 1 Gbps for up to 100 meters or 10 Gbps for up to 55 meters.
- **Cat6a** is an improvement of the Cat6 standard, supporting the same standards and lengths (with the ability to run 10 Gbps over 100 meters maximum), but using a higher quality cable that is more resistant to interference. This is most commonly used in wired networks today.

**RJ11:** A connector that supports two pairs of wires (four total); typically used in telephones.

**RJ45:** This is an end connector typically used with Ethernet cables and supports four pairs (eight wires).

**Coaxial cables:** Analog cables made of copper but specifically engineered with a metal shield intended to block signal interference. The protection on the coaxial cable allows them to be laid next to metal gutters or other objects without receiving interference. Today, coaxial cables are mostly used by cable TV companies to connect their customers to the company’s facilities.

**ST:** Stands for straight tip connector. This was the most commonly used connector with multimode fiber until the mid-2000s.

**LC:** Stands for lucent connector. This is a smaller version of the standard connector (SC). This supports more ports to be used in the same space.
