# Linux Essentials Certification #

Study information for the Linux Foundations Certification.  

Recommendation:

- Use this as a jump start for the certification
- Use RHEL 8 and/or Ubuntu with this information. If anything else is used you may have to do some research on the 1:1 for certain commands and processes.
- Practice, practice, practice. Practicing the commands in real scenarios will better help you understand what exactly does what.
