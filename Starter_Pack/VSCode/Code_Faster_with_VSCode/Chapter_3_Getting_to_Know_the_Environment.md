Chapter 3. Getting to Know the Environment
“A mobile robot has to devote a tremendous amount of processing time simply to avoid obstacles in the environment. Human beings do, too, but they’re never aware of it—until the lights go out. Then they learn painfully just how much processing is really required.”

— Michael Crichton “Prey”
Too often we take our environment for granted—the little things that we see every day and, yet, fail to notice. This section is meant to awaken you to the possibilities in your Visual Studio environment.

Most notably, the purpose is to highlight how best to work with your window layouts, how to use the toolbox to your advantage, and how to work with commands properly, among other things. Take time to really explore the Visual Studio environment, and you can unlock the secrets to navigating that same environment successfully.

Docking and undocking windows in the IDE has always been interesting. In Visual Studio, we have a tool called the Guide Diamond that is used to assist our efforts. The following illustration shows the Guide Diamond in Visual Studio 2008.


Unfortunately, this doesn’t really provide good visual cues to help determine the final position of a window. Visual Studio 2010 provides a new and improved Guide Diamond that makes docking much easier, as shown in the following illustration.


Now you can clearly see how your docked window will look based on the image in the diamond. Just drag the title bar of your window over one of the previews in the Guide Diamond.


When the preview matches where you want your window to go, just release the mouse and the window docks at that location.

Press Alt+F6 (next) or Alt+Shift+F6 (previous) to begin going through your open tool windows. It’s important to understand what the word “open” means in this context. An “open” tool window is one whose tab appears in the IDE. For example, suppose you have the following view:


The Error List, Command Window, and Breakpoints are “open” tool windows—even though the tool windows are hidden. This is an important distinction as you use this tip, because it explains why you cycle through all the open tool windows—whether or not they are hidden.

Ever wonder why the windows seem to shift around when you go from Design to Debug Mode? The answer is simple: window layouts.

You might have seen them if you have ever tried to export your window layouts. You can find it under General Settings | Window Layouts, as shown in the following illustration.


The four window layout modes in Visual Studio are as follows.

Design View
This view is the one you see when you start up Visual Studio. It’s what most people refer to as the “normal” view.

Debugging View
This is the view that you get when you enter Debug Mode as you are stepping through your code.

Full Screen
This is the view that you get when you go to View | Full Screen (Shift+Alt+Enter).

File View
This is the lesser-known view that you can get when you open up a file via devenv.exe [filename].


The thing to remember here is that your tool windows and your command bar customizations are saved separately for each state. There is no way to tell Visual Studio to use one state for all modes at this time. Additionally, when you shut down Visual Studio in any state, all four states are saved.

In vstipEnv0051, 03.08 Window Layouts: The Four Modes, page 90, I discussed the four layout modes in Visual Studio. I thought it would be instructive to demonstrate the three most common modes together here.

As we discuss these modes, keep in mind that each has its own layout that can be customized to your needs. For example, you might clearly need some windows in Design Mode (for example, the Pending Changes window) that perhaps aren’t necessary in Debug Mode.

Design Mode
This is the mode you see when you first start up Visual Studio. It is one of the two most common modes you will find yourself in. The following illustration shows a view of my Design Window Layout for a website.


Debug Mode
When I enter Debug Mode, the second most common mode, I see my Debug Window Layout, as shown in the following console application.


Full Screen Mode
I addressed this mode in vstipEnv0024, AX.20 Full Screen Mode, in Appendix B (http://go.microsoft.com/FWLink/?Linkid=223758). You can get here by pressing Shift+Alt+Enter. An example of what it looks like is shown in the following illustration.

The Toolbox is a pretty cool place, and one of its best features is the ability to organize items by using tabs.

Creating Tabs
To create a custom tab, right-click inside the Toolbox and choose Add Tab, as shown in the following illustration.


Just type in a name for your new tab, and press Enter.


Adding Items
You can add items to your custom tab as you see fit. For example, to add controls to this new tab from existing tabs, just pick the control you want and copy it.


Then go to your customized tab, and paste inside it to get a copy of that control for your use.


You can also click and drag items onto new tabs.


Custom Controls
Of course, if you want custom controls, you can always right-click in the custom tab and select Choose Items, as shown in the following illustration.


Renaming Tabs
If you don’t like a tab name, you can always rename it:


Deleting Tabs
Also notice the option to delete the tab, shown in the preceding illustration. If you choose this option, the following dialog box appears. When you click OK in this dialog box, you lose the tab as well as all the items on it.


This action is just an organizational mechanism and doesn’t permanently delete any controls from your system, so you can add them as needed to any future tabs.

When you are doing web development in Visual Studio, you might want to use a different default browser than you are currently using. You can do this by using the Browse With dialog box.

Getting to this dialog box is a little interesting because it is context sensitive. It is best to have either your web project or a webpage selected in Solution Explorer to see the Browse With option on the File Menu or when you right-click:


The Browse With dialog box appears as shown in the following illustration.


Adding New Browsers
Visual Studio automatically detects some browsers. For example, I installed Firefox and the preceding dialog box automatically detected it. However, if you don’t see your browser in the Browse With dialog box, you can click Add, enter the path to the executable in the Program Name field, and enter a friendly name for your browser in the Friendly Name field, as shown in the following illustration.

When using the Visual Studio command prompt (or any command prompt), you have several ways to use tab completion.

Simple Search
You can type the first letter of a file, as shown in the following illustration.


Then press Tab one or more times to see all the files that begin with that letter.


Wildcard Search
Not as well-known is the ability to use wildcards to match characters. You can use an asterisk (*) to represent any number of characters and a question mark (?) to represent a single character.

So if you want to find a file name that has the letter “a” anywhere in it, you would use *a* as shown in the following illustration.


Then press Tab to get the first result.


Press Tab several times, and notice that each file name listed contains the letter “a” somewhere in it.

What about a two-letter file that begins with a “c” but can have any other character and any extension? Use c?.* and press Tab.


Press Tab again.


This feature extends to any commands you want to use as well. You can type something like edit *a*, as shown in the following illustration.


Then press Tab to see the following result:


If I keep pressing tab, it continues to cycle through all file names that contain an “a”.

Finally
As you can see, tab completion is a very useful and powerful feature with the command prompt. You definitely want this skill in your tool belt.

Docking and undocking tool windows is a common activity. In this tip, we look at the different techniques you can use to accomplish these tasks.

Undock
You have multiple ways to undock a single tool window in a group.

Click and drag
With the mouse, you can click and drag the tab out of the group.


Menu
With the tool window active, you can select Window | Float from the menu bar, as shown in the following illustration.


Control box (Visual Studio 2010 only)
Press Alt+minus (–) to get the tool window menu.


Then press “F” to make the tool window float.

Result
Whichever method you use, the result is the same: You wind up with an undocked tool window.


Dock
To dock a floating tool window back into a group (assuming it came from a group), you also have multiple options.

Click and drag
By far, the hardest option is to click and drag the tool window back into the group. The best way to do this is to drag the tool window title bar over the title bar of another tool window in the group you want it to join, as shown in the following illustration.


Notice how the target shading looks like a tab being put onto the existing group? That is what you look for when doing it this way. Of course, I would do it this way only if I were taking a tab from one group to another, not if I were returning a floating tool window back to its original group.

Menu
The menu option is pretty easy: Just go to Window | Dock, as shown in the following illustration.


Control box (Visual Studio 2010 only)
And then there is the Control menu. Press Alt+minus (–) to get the menu.


Then press “K” to make the tool window dock back to its original location.

Result
You can use any of these methods to put the tool window back into the group it came from, with the notable exception of the click and drag method, which can be used to put the tool window anywhere.

Just about everything you do in Visual Studio comes with an associated command. But what exactly is a command?

According to the MSDN documentation (http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/kcc7tke7.aspx), commands “allow direct interaction with the integrated development environment (IDE) from the keyboard. Dialog boxes, windows, and other items within the IDE have a command equivalent that you can type into the Command window or Find/Command box to display and, in some cases, execute the item.”

In plain English, commands allow you to perform actions in Visual Studio. Let’s take adding a class as an example.

First, let’s examine the typical way you add a class. Normally, you would just go to Project | Add Class.


Obviously, this command is used to add a new class to your project and shows the Add New Item dialog box.


That’s too much extra work for something I like to use all the time. I want to search and see whether a specific command is associated with this action. To do this, I’ll use what most people refer to as the “command well,” because it is a deep “well” of commands. It’s where all the commands that you can use are located. To get there, go to Tools | Options | Environment | Keyboard, as shown in the following illustration

NOTE
For this example, I’m using the General keyboard settings, so your settings might have a shortcut key assigned already. You can still follow this tip to create a new shortcut.


I’ll type a keyword in the Show Commands Containing area to narrow down the command list. In this case, the keywords Add Class are used in the menu item, so I will use them here. In the following illustration, you can see how I have removed the spaces for the command.


Notice that among the available commands is the Project.AddClass command. It’s common to find a command that follows the menu structure, and this one is no exception.


Also notice that no shortcuts are associated with the command. We can now add one. For this example, let’s use Ctrl+M, Ctrl+7 as the shortcut key to be assigned.


For now, I won’t get into the nuances of assigning shortcut keys, but you can get the details at vstipTool0063, 03.26 Keyboard Shortcuts: Creating New Shortcuts, page 127. Assuming the key was assigned correctly, you can click OK and then press Ctrl+M, Ctrl+7 to see the Add New Item dialog box pop up, as shown in the following illustration.


Now you understand the power of commands. They can be quite useful, and after you assign a shortcut key, you can see it in the menu as well (if applicable).

It is sometimes cumbersome to type in a full command. You can use aliases to quickly use a command without having to type in the full command syntax. If you want a list of the current aliases, just open the Command Window (Ctrl+Alt+A) and type alias.


By the way, you can clear the Command Window out at any time by typing cls, just in case you get a lot of clutter in the window.

Let’s take a simple alias as an example. How about the “Debug.ToggleBreakpoint” command? Notice in the preceding list that the alias is “bp”. Let’s find a line of code.


Now we can go to the Command Window and type bp, as shown in the following illustration.


It puts a breakpoint on the line.


Create a New Alias
In addition to the aliases that are already there, you can create new ones. Let’s create one for the Project.AddClass command. Simply type alias [alias to use] [command]. In our case, let’s put in alias ac Project.AddClass, as shown in the following illustration.


Anytime we want to add a class, we can type the command alias ac and get the Add New Item dialog box.


Viewing Assigned Aliases
To show what command an alias is assigned to, just type alias [alias]. So, in this case, I would put in alias ac to see what command “ac” is bound to.


Delete an Alias
To get rid of an alias, type alias [alias] /d[elete]. To get rid of the alias we just made, we would type alias ac /d.


You can confirm the alias is gone by typing alias ac. You should see the result shown in the following illustration.

Some commands take arguments and switches so that you can quickly execute them without having to deal with user interface elements. You can get a list of commands that take arguments by going to the MSDN Documentation article entitled “Visual Studio Commands with Arguments,” at http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/c338aexd.aspx.

The best way to learn is by doing, so let’s use the Edit.Find command. If you want to know more about what Find can do, take a look at vstipFind0007, 05.02 Using Quick Find, on page 172.

Basic Use
First, open up the Command Window (Ctrl+Alt+A) and run the command without any arguments, as shown in the following illustration.


The preceding command opens the Find And Replace dialog box, shown in the following illustration.


Arguments and Switches
According to the “Find Command” documentation at http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/295dhke9.aspx, the Edit.Find command takes one argument and 12 possible switches. The general syntax for the command is as follows:

Edit.Find findwhat [/case] [/doc | /proc | /open | /sel] [/markall] [/options] [/reset] [/
up] [/wild | /regex] [/word]
I’ll resist the urge to copy and paste from the documentation here and just focus on the items we are going to use.

Argument
findwhat—Required. The text to match.

Switches
/doc or /d—Optional. Searches the current document only. You can use only one of the available search scopes: /doc, /proc (procedure), /open (all open documents), or /sel (current selection).

/markall or /m—Optional. Places a [bookmark] on each line that contains a search match within the current document.

/wild or /l—Optional. Uses predefined special characters in the findwhat argument as notations to represent a character or sequence of characters.

List Current Options
You can list out the current options that are set for the Edit.Find command by typing Edit.Find /options, as shown in the following illustration.


Reset Options
You can reset the options to the default values by typing Edit.Find /reset.


Using the Arguments and Switches
Let’s put this command to the test. We want to bypass the Quick Find dialog box and just find things. We will use the following command:

Edit.Find *c* /wild /doc /markall
This command finds any line in the current document (/doc) that has the letter “c” anywhere in it, using wildcards (/wild) and placing a bookmark (/markall) on each line.

The following illustration shows the code we are going to use before we run the command.


We run our command.


The result is shown in the following illustration.


And now we have a working command that bypasses the Quick Find dialog box and just finds things.

Make an Alias
What if we want to use this all the time? We can make an alias out of the command. In this case, we type alias findc Edit.Find *c* /wild /doc /markall, as shown in the following illustration.


More information on aliases can be found in vstipTool0068 (03.20 Understanding Commands: Aliases, page 113). You can double-check the alias assignment by typing alias findc.


From now on, you just type findc in the Command Window, and it performs the predefined search.

Throughout these tips, I include the command when available. But you might be wondering how to test a command to see how it works. Let’s take a look at one quick way.

First, figure out what command you want to test. In our case, let’s test “View.ViewCode”.

Press Ctrl+Alt+A to bring up the Command Window.


Because we’re testing “ViewCode”, we have a Design window open so that it can switch to the code. Now start typing the command we want to test (case doesn’t matter).


As you can see in the preceding illustration, we have IntelliSense helping us with the command. Now we just press Enter to see the command in action.


Now you have tested a command. Feel free to try various commands to see what they do, but make sure to set up the context as we did in this example to ensure that the command works properly. Some commands can’t be run from the Command Window and might require that you assign a shortcut key or use the Find Combo box.

Whenever you work with commands, you have four main ways you can run them. For example, not all commands will run from the Command Window, so it is a good idea to familiarize yourself with the other options. Let’s take a look at each way.

Shortcuts
The easiest way to run a command is when a shortcut is attached to it. For example, View.Code has a couple of shortcut keys attached to it.

NOTE
For more information about shortcut keys, see vstipTool0061 (03.24 Find Keyboard Shortcuts, on the next page).


Command Window
The Command Window (Ctrl+Alt+A) is specifically designed to run commands. Just type in the command, and press Enter.


Immediate Window
You can run many commands from the Immediate Window (Ctrl+Alt+I) by typing a greater-than sign (>). Then type any command and press Enter.


Find Combo Box
A little-known feature enables you to run commands from the Find Combo Box (Ctrl+D) on the standard toolbar. Just type a greater-than sign (>), then type any command, and press Enter.


For most language settings, you can bypass the typing of the greater-than sign by using Ctrl+Forward Slash (/), which takes you to the Find Combo Box and automatically inserts the sign for you.

Ever just want to see the keyboard shortcuts available in Visual Studio? Let’s say, for example, that you want to see if View | Code has any keyboard shortcuts. A quick look at the menu doesn’t reveal anything.


But that’s not the end of the story. If we go to Tools | Options | Environment | Keyboard, we get the following dialog box.


Pretty much everything you do in Visual Studio has a command that runs to execute that action. In our case, we know that View | Code is the path to the command we want, so let’s start by trying to see whether we have a “View.Code” command. Notice that commands use dot notation between items:


Sadly, what we want isn’t there. OK, so either it isn’t there or it’s called something else. We still know it’s off the View menu, so let’s type in View. and browse to see whether anything pops up.


If we scroll down far enough, we actually find an entry for “View.ViewCode”. If we look under Shortcuts For Selected Command, we see a couple of shortcut entries, as shown in the following illustration.


It looks like pressing F7 in the Designer does the trick, so let’s try it.


Go to the Designer and press F7.


As we can see in the preceding illustration, we have discovered the shortcut key for viewing code in the Designer.

There is also another entry for the Class Diagram that uses Enter to show us code. Let’s open up a Class Diagram and select a class.


Then press Enter.


It takes us to the code as well. So now you know how to find shortcut keys (if they exist) for a command.

One of the most important places you can go in Visual Studio is the Tools | Options | Environment | Keyboard area, shown in the following illustration.


In vstipTool0061, 03.24 Find Keyboard Shortcuts, page 122, we looked at how to find shortcut keys for given commands. Now let’s focus on the Apply The Following Additional Keyboard Mapping Scheme drop-down list.


This list allows you to apply additional keyboard shortcuts that were common in certain previous versions.


Let’s take an example. If we have the default mapping scheme and want to see the shortcuts for View.ViewCode, we see the options presented in the following illustration.


However, if we add an additional mapping scheme (Visual C++ 6 in this example), this gets the following result:


Notice that we have a new shortcut that wasn’t there before. This is how adding additional mapping schemes work. If you don’t want these additional keys, just set Apply The Following Additional Keyboard Mapping Scheme to Default (or General, if it is available in the list).

Creating keyboard shortcuts is easy. Let’s walk through an example to show you how. First, go to Tools | Options | Environment | Keyboard.


Now let’s assume we want to modify the “View.ViewCode” command to include a new shortcut. Notice the existing shortcuts (assuming no additional keyboard mapping schemes).


We want to add Ctrl+Z as the shortcut, so click in the Press Shortcut Keys area and press Ctrl+Z.


There is a problem. Looking down at the Shortcut Currently Used By area, we see that Ctrl+Z is already mapped to the Edit.Undo command. Because that is an important key combination to us, let’s try a new set of shortcut keys. How about Ctrl+Alt+4? Just use backspace to get rid of the current entry, and press Ctrl+Alt+4.


Perfect. It isn’t being used by anything currently—but we aren’t done yet. We have to decide what scope we want this shortcut to be available in. Notice the drop-down to the left of the new shortcut under Use New Shortcut In? The default scope is global, so you can use it at any time. However, you can narrow the scope down to a specific area.


For example, if we wanted to have this shortcut available only when we’re editing XML, we would change Global to XML (Text) Editor. For now, let’s keep the Global setting.


After we’ve decided on the scope and the shortcut keys, all we have to do is click Assign, as shown in the preceding illustration, to make the shortcut available.


If you mess up here, you can choose the shortcut key and click Remove to start over.

WARNING
You can remove any shortcut, so be careful to remove only the shortcuts you actually want to eliminate.

Click OK, and let’s go test our new shortcut. Go to Design View in any project.


Press Ctrl+Alt+4 to see the following result:


It should take you to the code. You now know how to map new keyboard shortcuts.

Reset
If you make a mistake with your shortcut keys, you can always click the Reset button in Tools | Options | Environment | Keyboard.


Don’t take this option lightly. Refer to vstipTool0064 (03.27 Keyboard Shortcuts: Reset All Your Shortcuts, page 131).

On rare occasions, you might lose track of all the custom shortcuts you have made, or maybe you just want to reset all your shortcuts back to their default settings. You can reset all your keyboard shortcuts by clicking the Reset button in Tools | Options | Environment | Keyboard.


When you click this button, you get the following warning message:


NOTE
Take this warning seriously! It resets all keyboard mappings to their default values if you click Yes, so you should use this only if you are sure of the consequences.

When using commands, sometimes you want to keep a log of the ones you used. This is especially useful when you are experimenting with commands to see what iterations you went through. The syntax for logging is as follows:

log [filename] [/on|/off] [/overwrite]
Or you can use the following:

Tools.LogCommandWindowOutput [filename] [/on|/off] [/overwrite]
Arguments
The following sections describe what the preceding arguments do.

Filename
It’s highly recommended that you use a path and file name; otherwise, the default file name is cmdline.log and the log file is stored at C:\Users\<user>\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\VisualStudio\<version>.


/on /off
This argument turns logging on or off.

/overwrite
By default, all logging operations append to your log file. The /overwrite switch changes this behavior and erases any previous commands from the log when a new log session starts.

Example
First, type the “log” command in the Command Window (Ctrl+Alt+A) and specify a file name by typing log C:\Users\<user>\Documents\vslog.txt /on, as shown in the following illustration.


Now type in a couple of commands. The specific commands don’t matter here, so feel free to substitute your own commands instead of using mine if you like. I used the commands View.ViewCode to get a code window, and I used Edit.Find sys to find some text.


At this point, you’re done typing comments. Turn logging off by using the log /off command.


Now browse to the My Documents folder to see the file.


If you open the file, you should see something similar to the following:


As you can see, the file contains a running log of the commands you entered, including the last command to turn logging off.

If you want to add additional external tools, you can go to Tools | External Tools.


As an example, let’s add the Visual Studio command prompt to our external tools list. First, click Add and put in a Title of Visual Studio Command Prompt.


In this case, the Visual Studio command prompt has an icon that we can use to get the information we need. Let’s go to its properties.


After you click Properties, you see the following dialog box.


As you can see, the Target field points to %comspec%, with some arguments after it. The variable %comspec% points to the command prompt on the current Windows system and can be used on just about any version of Windows. Let’s put that into the Command field for our purposes.


If you weren’t using a system variable like this, you could type in the path to the command or use the ellipsis and browse.


For the Arguments field, again, let’s just take from the Visual Studio command prompt properties and enter the path shown in the following illustration.


If you want to add items specific to Visual Studio, you can click the arrow to the right and get a large list of variables you can insert as arguments.


The Initial Directory lets you define where you want to start up. I don’t have a preference here, so I will leave it blank, but I could type in a path or use one of the variables available to me by clicking on the arrow to the right of the Initial Directory field.


Finally, you can choose from several options at the bottom.


Use Output Window
Selecting this option runs the command and puts any output into the Output window. This is useful for commands that just return some data you want to look at. For our command prompt, this wouldn’t be a good choice because we want to type in commands.

Treat Output As Unicode
If your tool returns Unicode output, you would select this check box.

Prompt For Arguments
This option shows a dialog box that enables you to modify the arguments before the command is run or to put in completely new arguments.


Close On Exit
Selecting this option determines whether the window should close when the tool closes. In the case of our command prompt, with this option checked when we type exit and press Enter, the window closes. However, if this option is not checked and we do the same thing, we get the result shown in the following illustration.


When you are all done, just click OK, and you now have your command showing up in the external tools list off the Tools menu.

Now you can press any letter that is underlined to access that item. For example, if the letter “G” if pressed, it opens up the Create GUID tool. You can see how this is created by going to Tools | External Tools on the menu bar.


Notice the ampersand (&) before the “G” in “GUID”? Anytime you put an ampersand before any character in your title, the next character after it becomes the accelerator key.

As a developer, you are always looking for images that can be used in your applications. Visual Studio comes with a set of images to help you out. In fact, it comes with over 2000 output files, images ready for immediate use, as well as a variety of source files that you can use to create your own images if needed. These images come from Microsoft Windows, the Office system, Microsoft Visual Studio, and other Microsoft software.

You can find them in a .zip file located at “C:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio <version>\Common7\VS<version>ImageLibrary\1033.” For example, I found my images at “C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio 10.0\Common7\VS2010ImageLibrary\1033”:


Types of Files
The Visual Studio Image Library folders contain source files and output files.

Source files
Source files contain building blocks intended for use with an image editor to generate new or to customize existing icons.


Output files
Typically, output files are composite images made up of a base concept with 1–3 adorners, ready for immediate use by developers.


Image Library Contents
The following illustration provides an idea of what is included in the Visual Studio Image Library and what each group of images is used for:


_Common Elements
Have you ever tried to edit an existing image that is made up of several overlapping elements? Then you know how hard it is to make simple changes in an output file. In this section, each source file is made up of various sizes of each element on a transparent background. When used with an image editor that utilizes layers, such as Adobe Photoshop or Paint.NET, you can choose the size of an element that fits best with what you’re trying to do and then make adjustments by layering the pieces, moving them around without editing the bits that are in the lower layers.


When the final image is composed just the way you like it, you can then flatten and save the file in a usable format such as .ico, .bmp, or .png. A typical use of source files would be to take an existing image and add an adorner from the _Common Elements source files, such as adding a “new” star to the upper left to indicate a command that creates a new item of that base type:


Actions
The Actions folder set contains output file images that represent verbs. Most commands are verbs, so if you are building a toolbar or ribbon, you would find most of those images in the Actions folder. In the Visual Studio Image Library, the Actions images are separated by format (24-bit, 32-bit, .ico, and .png), size (16x16, 24x24, 32x32), and style (Office/Visual Studio, DataTools, Windows Vista, and Windows XP).



Use the format that works best within your code; 24-bit .bmp files use a fuchsia color that you can map to the background color of your user interface so that it appears to have a transparent background; 32-bit .bmp files contain a transparent background, although in File Explorer it appears black, and .ico and .png files have transparent backgrounds as well. Also, each style is illustrated differently, so generally, you should choose one style and stay consistent, not mixing different styles in the same user interface.

Animations
This folder contains a few of the common animations that you see in Windows and that are used in dialog boxes or other user interface elements to indicate that a process is underway. You have .avi and .gif formats available for most of the animations; which format you use will be determined by which format is best supported by the technology you’re using for your user interface.


Annotations_Buttons
The Annotations_Buttons folder contains images for notifications, simple actions such as expand/collapse, or to describe the state of an object or process—for example, running, paused, or offline. This group of files is also separated out by format (24-bit .bmp, .ico, and .png) as well as style. Notice that the Windows Vista .ico annotations contain the full range of sizes that can be viewed in the File Explorer and appear correctly in accordance with the size required by your user interface.


Objects
Objects are output image files representing nouns. Because they represent objects, the most common usage for these files is in tree views, list views, or containers such as toolboxes. When used in this way, these images enable the user to scan a list of elements and to identify types of objects without needing to read the name of the item. Sometimes objects can also represent commands, such as a command to create a new object of that type (New File) or to launch a user interface element related to that object (for example, a stopwatch image used to indicate Start Timer).


In the png_format Windows Vista folder, you can find a wide variety of sizes and colors of various flags, arrows, +/- signs, and so forth, which can be used to indicate a variety of meanings. Generally, Object images are used as base elements when creating a new compound icon. Base elements augmented by annotations or other actions/object images can indicate the state or type of the base image and form a visual language when used with variations of similar icons:


Using the Images
The images are meant to be used for their original intent. So, for example, you can’t use the Paste image for something other than a paste operation. When you are using or creating these images, it is important that you make sure to use the images in a manner that is consistent with the description of the respective image in the readme document found in its respective folder:
