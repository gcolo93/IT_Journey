CHAPTER 16

Troubleshooting Operating Systems

In this chapter, you will learn how to

-   Perform common Windows OS troubleshooting steps

-   Identify symptoms of and troubleshoot common Windows OS problems

-   Identify symptoms of and troubleshoot problems related to motherboards, RAM, CPU, and power

As we have discussed in previous chapters, you can perform regular maintenance, keep your system updated, and be vigilant with respect to security, but inevitably something will go wrong. Sometimes the cause is human error, but quite often things simply go wrong with both software and hardware. Knowing what to check and how to address issues will be a very large part of your job.

In this chapter we'll look first at some common Windows troubleshooting procedures that can serve as a good foundation for dealing with all kinds of issues. From there, we'll consider a list of more specific symptoms that you should know about. Finally, we will wrap up with talking about how to identify and troubleshoot hardware-related issues. All of these are major themes on the CompTIA A+ 1101 and 1102 exams, so take time to digest this material.

NOTE   We are going to be doing a lot of troubleshooting in this chapter, so now is a good time to turn back to Chapter 1 and review CompTIA's troubleshooting methodology.

1102

Common Windows Troubleshooting Procedures

Learning how to troubleshoot and fix specific problems efficiently is part of becoming a great troubleshooter, but in my mind it's even more important to know how to hit the ground running when you honestly have no clue why a system is acting up. In this section we'll look at several troubleshooting procedures for Windows that you can fall back on to get your systems up and running in a pinch. Buckle up!

NOTE   The CompTIA A+ 1102 objectives call these troubleshooting steps, but I'm using the word procedures because they aren't a well-ordered list of things you should follow sequentially.

Turning Things Off and Back On

For as long as we've had computers, turning them off and back on has been an important troubleshooting procedure. Because software and hardware can both have tiny defects, the longer a system runs without a reboot, the more likely it is to run into trouble. One common cause of this slow descent into chaos is programs that don't properly clean up and release the resources they've been using, preventing the system from allocating those resources to other applications. This is most common with memory---so common, in fact, that we have a special term for it: a memory leak.

You can waste a lot of time trying to figure out what's going wrong only for a reboot to instantly clear up the problem. As long as there isn't a good reason not to reboot a system, I'd reboot it any time you run into a problem that you don't recognize, just to see if it clears up. You might feel like rebooting is throwing up your hands in defeat, but there will always be problems that we have to manage with reboots until some developer or manufacturer releases an update.

Don't think these kinds of problems just apply to programs that you run as a user. Long-running services wear a lot of important hats in modern operating systems. Compared to in-your-face desktop applications, it's easy to forget all about services when they behave themselves. But they are still software---and most software has bugs and defects.

No matter which app you are using, when some general feature of your OS stops working---maybe it can't connect to the network, print a document, or find files that you know are there---there's a decent chance a misbehaving or crashed service is to blame. In the "Services Not Starting" section later in this chapter, I'll show you how Windows will warn you if a particularly important service fails to start when you boot the system.

One way to troubleshoot cases like this is to try to restart services to see if the problem goes away. In my opinion, you'll often be able to reboot a system when you run into a problem like this. It is rarely even obvious which service to restart! The main time you'd want to go to the effort of restarting services is when there's a good reason you can't reboot---perhaps the system is acting as a database server or in the middle of processing a massive print job.

CompTIA, however, wants you to know that restarting services is a common troubleshooting procedure (especially if Windows notifies you that a critical service failed to start). It's possible the service failed for a temporary reason and giving it a swift kick may get it going again.

NOTE   Refer to Chapter 12 for the lowdown on how to stop and start services with both the Task Manager and the Services MMC snap-in.

System File Check

Most of the time Windows will either work just fine or collapse in a heap, but if you use it long enough, you'll eventually run into cases where it's acting strange. Whenever problems like this persist even after I reboot, the hair tends to stand up on my arms. As you'll see in Chapter 27, erratic behavior is one of the telltale signs of a malware infestation. But there are still some simpler explanations to rule out before you panic.

Back in Chapter 15 I showed you a cool little Windows utility called sfc (System File Checker). It'll search your system files to ensure they're all present and not corrupted---and try to replace the files if there's a problem. It isn't the best thing since sliced bread, but running it is a good idea to rule out these kinds of issues if a system's misbehaving.

EXAM TIP   The CompTIA A+ 1102 exam objectives call this troubleshooting procedure system file check, but the actual tool is named System File Checker. Don't get tripped up by this difference if it pops up on the exam!

Uninstall/Reinstall/Update Applications

From time to time, an application will just break on you. Most of the time it'll be broken from the moment you install it or break right after you update the application or your OS. Once in a blue moon, the application will just break for no obvious reason. It'll work fine one time, and then...not at all.

If a program isn't working quite right, a good first step is to see if it has any updates available and, if so, apply the updates and confirm you still see the problem on the newest version. If the program destabilizes the system, you should uninstall it before doing anything else.

If the program broke after you updated it or the OS, either one might have a bug or might no longer be compatible with the other. Verify that the program and OS are still compatible. If not, you might need to update the OS to a newer version, or even set aside a system to run an older (compatible) version of the OS. It's also possible that the software requirements have changed---make sure to verify them.

Less frequently, a program may just stop working out of the blue even though nothing's changed recently. Many programs read and write data to files on the system as they run, and even the tiniest problem in these data files could crash the program. These incompatibilities can be caused by things like an application crash, the power going out, or restoring older copies of the data files. Uninstalling and reinstalling the program may clear the bad data and get you on your way.

Some programs store data files in locations that aren't deleted when you uninstall the program, so they'll keep right on failing after you reinstall them. In this case, you'll need to research the file locations (they differ from program to program) and manually delete them.

If none of these steps help---especially if you know the software is running fine on similar systems---the failure may actually be an early sign of hardware trouble. The specifics can vary from program to program, but an application that tickles your system just right can easily turn up early signs of failure in almost any component or peripheral plugged into your system!

NOTE   Refer back to Chapter 14 if you need to refresh your knowledge of compatibility problems between programs and the OS or review the actual process of updating, uninstalling, or reinstalling applications.

Resource Requirements

When a system or its applications start misbehaving out of nowhere, it's natural to focus on the exact program or feature that isn't working, or recent changes such as updates. That'll usually lead you in the right direction, but it can also blind you to the obvious.

Our systems are constantly changing in ways that can affect the resources available to our programs and OS. Every new application we install takes more resources. Every file we create or download takes up a little storage space. Every time the OS or an application automatically updates, it may use more resources, fewer resources, or just a different balance of them.

When we're having unexplained trouble, good techs aren't afraid to ask simple questions like whether the device meets the system requirements for the OS and programs the user is trying to run. If the answer is no, the solution is usually to move the user to a newer system or add resources (upgrade the RAM, storage, processor, graphics card, and so on) to the existing one.

EXAM TIP   The CompTIA A+ 1102 objectives refer to this troubleshooting procedure as verify requirements. These are the system requirements (CPU, RAM, graphics, storage, and so on) discussed in Chapter 14. Be prepared to see the follow-on procedure---add resources---on the exam as well.

Recovering When Windows Breaks

When things get hairy enough that Windows can't even load or work right, you can usually get the system running again with a special set of tools called the Windows Recovery Environment.

EXAM TIP   Techs often refer to the Windows Recovery Environment as WinRE or Windows RE. Because the CompTIA A+ 1102 objectives don't refer directly to WinRE---they just refer to the options you'll find inside it---I'm not sure if you'll see any of these names on the exam. Microsoft also refers to the options themselves as the System Recovery Options. To be safe, be ready to recognize all of these names plus the names of the individual options!

WinRE includes an impressive, powerful set of both automated and manual utilities that collectively diagnoses and fixes all but the most serious of Windows boot problems. Although WinRE does all the hard work for you, you still need to know how to access and use it. When faced with a failure-to-boot scenario in modern versions of Windows, WinRE is one of your primary tools.

In Windows, you can access WinRE in a few ways depending on the state of your system. First, if your system boots, you can hold SHIFT while clicking the Restart button on the Start menu or login screen. Alternatively, from the Settings app, open the Update & Security category (System category in Windows 11), click Recovery, and then click Restart now in the Advanced startup section. But if you can't boot Windows, you can boot from the Windows installation media and select Repair your computer (see Figure 16-1).

Figure 16-1  Repair your computer option on the Windows 11 installer

You can also create Windows installation media by downloading it directly from Microsoft (https://www.microsoft.com/software-download/) and making a bootable USB drive. If you're already using a Windows machine, select the version of Windows you want to install and download the corresponding Windows media creation tool. Insert a USB drive and run the media creation tool to create a bootable USB drive. (If you aren't already using a Windows machine, you'll need to download the ISO file and look up how to create a bootable USB drive on your OS.)

Using the advanced startup options to boot into WinRE usually works, so it's a good place to start. You should access WinRE from the Windows installation media if your system is too messed up to boot WinRE or you think the system may have malware.

WinRE offers few choices initially, so you'll have to click around a bit to find the good stuff. Don't be surprised if you see something different than what's shown in the screenshots in this section---Microsoft likes to fiddle with the options from version to version, and they can also differ from system to system. In Windows 11, the main menu starts (see Figure 16-2) with a few options:

Figure 16-2  Recovery Environment main screen in Windows 11

-   Continue

-   Use a device

-   Troubleshoot

-   Turn off your PC

Click the Troubleshoot option to see a couple more options, as shown in Figure 16-3. (If you boot from the installation media, clicking Troubleshoot will take you directly to the Advanced options screen discussed next.)

Figure 16-3  WinRE Troubleshoot screen

-   Reset this PC

-   Advanced options

Clicking Advanced options reveals another menu (see Figure 16-4) that shows a lot of options (you may have to click See more recovery options to see them all). I want to discuss seven of these (you may see them in a different order):

Figure 16-4  WinRE Advanced options screen

-   System Restore

-   Startup Settings

-   Uninstall Updates

-   System Image Recovery (not shown in Figure 16-4)

-   Startup Repair

-   Command Prompt

-   UEFI Firmware Settings (if your system has UEFI)

Let's look at the details of these options plus Reset this PC.

EXAM TIP   Make sure you know how to access the Windows Recovery Environment and what each of the available tools does.

System Restore

System Restore enables you to go back to a time when your computer worked properly. This option gives those of us who make many restore points---snapshots of a system at various points in time---a handy way to return a system to a previous state (see Figure 16-5).

Figure 16-5  System Restore list of restore points

NOTE   As we discussed back in Chapter 14, System Restore is now disabled by default. So, if you are attempting to fix a Windows machine by rolling back with System Restore, there is a good chance you will find that there are no snapshots available.

Startup Settings

It isn't in the CompTIA A+ 1102 exam objectives, but the Startup Settings option enables you to control some special troubleshooting and developer modes that Windows can start up in. Sooner or later, there's a good chance you'll need to use these settings to access Safe Mode (a staple of Windows troubleshooting for decades)!

Uninstall Updates

Use the Uninstall Updates option in the very off chance that Microsoft pushes out an update that breaks things in your system. It's happened in the past, so Microsoft includes this option just in case. You'll likely never need to use it.

System Image Recovery

Use the System Image Recovery tool to restore a system after a catastrophe. This is a great tool if you manage a set of uniform systems, typical in many workplaces. Keep a default image on hand, including OS settings, network settings, and applications, and you can quickly reimage a borked computer to get clients up and running. You can keep a simpler image as well, one that reloads the OS for further customization.

If you have the drive containing the system image plugged in when you first run the wizard, it should detect your latest backup and give you the option to restore it. After you select the image you want to restore, the utility presents you with some additional options that affect how it will reimage your system.

After you click Finish on the confirmation screen, which also contains a final warning, the restore process begins. The utility removes the old system data and then copies the backed-up system image to the hard drive(s). Once the process completes, your system reboots and should start up again with all of your data and programs just where you left them when you last backed up.

Startup Repair

The Startup Repair utility serves as a one-stop, do-it-all option (see Figure 16-6). When run, it performs a number of repairs, including:

Figure 16-6  Startup Repair's rather bare-bones interface for Windows 11 in actio

-   Repairs a corrupted Registry by accessing the backup copy on your hard drive

-   Restores critical boot files

-   Restores critical system and driver files

-   Rolls back any non-working drivers

-   Rolls back updates

-   Runs chkdsk

-   Runs a memory test to check your RAM

Startup Repair fixes almost any Windows boot problem (Windows can even start it automatically if it detects a boot problem). In fact, if you have a system with one hard drive containing a single partition with Windows installed, you'd have trouble finding something Startup Repair couldn't fix. Upon completion, Startup Repair will let you know whether it succeeded and where to find a log file called srttrail.txt that lists exactly what the program found, what it fixed, and what it failed to do. Its content may look cryptic, but you can type anything you find in this file into a search engine and easily find more information.

EXAM TIP   The CompTIA 1102 exam objectives have their own terms for referring to these WinRE procedures. They refer to System Restore as restore, Uninstall Updates as roll back updates, System Image Repair as reimage, and Startup Repair as repair Windows. Make sure you recognize these names for the exam!

Command Prompt

The nerdiest option in the WinRE menu is Command Prompt. The WinRE command prompt functions similarly to the regular cmd shell in Windows, covered in Chapter 15. WinRE's command prompt enables you to do some low-level rocket surgery on your system in order to recover from thorny problems.

The WinRE command prompt contains utilities for repairing or modifying the low-level structure that points to the files your system needs to boot up (bootrec and bcdedit), utilities for working with your system's storage devices and file systems (diskpart, fsinfo, fsutil), and more. Luckily for you, the CompTIA A+ 1102 objectives cover many fewer of these utilities than previous versions of the CompTIA A+ objectives. Know that these tools are here in case you need them someday---but for now I'll focus on the only one you'll see on the exam: diskpart.

NOTE   The Startup Repair tool runs many of these command-prompt utilities automatically. You need to use the WinRE command prompt only for unique situations where the Startup Repair tool fails.

The diskpart utility is a fully featured partitioning tool. It lacks many of the safety features built into Disk Management (covered in Chapters 8 and 9), so proceed with caution. You can, for example, delete any partition of any type at any time. Starting diskpart opens a special command prompt as shown here:

C:\Windows\system32>diskpart

Microsoft DiskPart version 10.0.17134.345

Copyright (C) Microsoft Corporation.

On computer: MIKESPC

DISKPART>

You can list volumes (or partitions on basic disks):

Select a volume to manipulate (you may also select an entire drive):

DISKPART> select volume 1

Volume 1 is the selected volume.

DISKPART>

You can run commands at the diskpart prompt to add, change, or delete volumes and partitions on drives, mount or dismount volumes, and even manipulate software-level RAID arrays. Use the format command to format a newly created volume.

Run the clean command at the diskpart prompt to wipe all partition and volume information off the currently selected disk. This tool handles nasty corruptions that simply won't let Windows boot and serves as my last-ditch step before I toss a drive.

UEFI Firmware Settings

Getting into system settings in UEFI-based motherboards can be a challenge. Although pressing the DELETE key repeatedly works sometimes, the opportunity flashes by very quickly. The UEFI Firmware Settings option enables you to access the system setup utility when you restart your computer via the Recovery option in Settings. Use the UEFI Firmware Settings option when you're tweaking things like CPU or RAM timings, or you want to change the boot order for some reason.

EXAM TIP   CompTIA won't ask about the UEFI Firmware Settings option on the CompTIA A+ 1102 exam---but it is a helpful little option when you're already in WinRE.

Reset This PC

When less aggressive options (such as Startup Repair or System Restore) fail to get you back up and running, you may need to bite the bullet and reinstall Windows. Luckily, Microsoft makes this pretty easy---it's exactly what the Reset this PC option mentioned earlier in this section does. As a reminder, to access it from the main WinRE menu, click Troubleshoot and you'll find it listed with Advanced options (refer to Figure 16-3). Reset this PC has two suboptions with dramatically different outcomes:

-   Keep my files Reinstalls Windows but preserves your files and settings and any applications purchased from the Windows Store. Note well: this option deletes every other application on your system.

-   Remove everything Nukes your system---all apps, programs, user files, user settings---leaving you with a fresh installation of Windows. Use it as a last resort when troubleshooting a PC. And back up your data first.

EXAM TIP   If you're wondering where Reset this PC gets this fresh copy of Windows, you're asking a great question. Back in Chapter 11 I mentioned that systems often keep a spare copy of the OS on a hidden recovery partition. That's exactly what Reset this PC is doing---using the copy hidden in the recovery partition to reinstall Windows. You might also see this referred to as a repair installation on the CompTIA A+ 1102 exam.

Rebuild Windows Profiles

Each user account on a Windows machine has an associated user profile that records settings such as Desktop preferences (like background and color), shortcuts, and other icons. A corrupt profile can block a user from logging in and getting access to his or her stuff. Corrupt profiles can also manifest as very slow profile load times. Anti-malware software can sometimes corrupt a profile, as can upgrading from one version of Windows to another. You have two options to rebuild a Windows profile: perform several direct Registry edits or create a new user account and copy the old profile settings to the new account.

The Registry edits are a little complex, so here are the steps. The first step is to get into Safe Mode (you'll find this in the WinRE Advanced options | Startup Settings discussed earlier). Once in Safe Mode, access an elevated command prompt. (Type cmd in the Search field, right-click the Command Prompt option, and select Run as administrator.) Type regedit and press ENTER to open the Registry Editor. Navigate to the following string to get to the screen shown in Figure 16-7:

Figure 16-7  ProfileList in Registry

HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\ProfileList

Click the ProfileList arrow on the left to see a set of entries that start with S-1-5. Select the one that matches the messed-up profile. Figure 16-7 shows a user named Scott (which you can barely make out in the ProfileImagePath on the right pane). At the bottom of the right pane, double-click the State entry, set the value to 0 (see Figure 16-8), and click OK.

Figure 16-8  Setting the State to 0

Here's the last step. If you have an option for RefCount on the right, double-click it and set the value to 0. If you don't have that entry, create it: Edit | New | DWORD (32-bit) Value. Close the Registry Editor and reboot the computer. That profile should work.

If the profile doesn't work, then the next option is to create a new user account and essentially duplicate the earlier profile. Boot back into Safe Mode and open an elevated command prompt. You need an administrator account to create a new user, so that's what you're about to access. To activate the super-secret-hidden local administrator account, the command to use is net user. Type net user and press ENTER:

net user administrator /active:yes

Reboot the computer and log in as the local administrator you just activated. Create a new user account: Settings | Accounts | Other users | Add someone else to this PC (see Figure 16-9). Give the account a unique name. Go to the Users folder of the corrupted account and copy all the contents to the new account's Users folder, but do it one folder at a time to avoid copying any of the corrupted hidden files.

Figure 16-9  Creating a new user account in Windows 10

When you reboot the computer, you should be able to log on to the newly created account and access all the old/corrupt accounts files. Once verified, log back on as administrator, delete the corrupted account, and rename the new account to the same as the old account.

Both processes for recovering a corrupted user profile are clunky, but they work. Expect to see a question or two on this topic on the CompTIA A+ 1102 exam.

Troubleshooting Common Windows OS Symptoms

If you have used the same PC for any period of time, you know things will inevitably go wrong. An application might crash, the system drags along incredibly slowly, or it might present you with the dreaded BSoD! This is when most users reach for tech support. But we're not most users, we're techs! In this section, we are going to cover the most common symptoms that crop up when using Windows and how to troubleshoot them.

NOTE   Remember that these are just some of the most common issues you will work with. Rest assured that this is far from a complete list. Over time you will see all manner of problems arise; however, by being very methodical in how you troubleshoot, you will be able to solve almost any problem---even ones you have never seen before.

Blue Screen of Death

Device driver problems that stop Windows from loading look pretty sad. Figure 16-10 shows a Windows Stop error, better known as the Blue Screen of Death (BSoD). The BSoD only appears when something causes an error from which Windows cannot recover. The BSoD is not limited to device driver problems, but device drivers are one of the reasons you'll see the BSoD.

Figure 16-10  BSoD in Windows 10

Whenever faced with a scenario where you get a BSoD, read what it says. Windows BSoDs tell you the name of the file that caused the problem and usually suggest a recommended action (aside from the automatic restart). Once in a while these are helpful.

BSoD problems due to device drivers almost always take place immediately after you've installed a new device and rebooted. Take out the device and reboot. If Windows loads properly, head over to the device manufacturer's Web site. A new device producing this type of problem is a serious issue that should have been caught before the device was released. In many cases, the manufacturer will have updated drivers available for download or will recommend a replacement device. If Windows doesn't load properly, try the Startup Repair procedure discussed earlier.

Sluggish Performance

One day you realize that your once blazingly fast computer now runs at snail's pace. What happened? Where did the almost instantaneous startup go? Why are you watching apps load up in minutes rather than in seconds?

Like humans, computers tend to accumulate clutter over time. By the time you notice it, it's usually already started to affect your computer's performance. One source of clutter is programs that start automatically when you boot the device and consume resources that you'd probably rather use for something else. We talked about controlling autostarting software in Chapter 14, and that's exactly the cure for this disease.

To stop these unwanted programs from wasting time and resources, bring up the Task Manger's Startup tab (see Figure 16-11) and review the enabled applications for any you don't need. This tab shows the publisher of the app, whether autostart is enabled or disabled, and even an estimate of how much resource impact the app has at startup. If you aren't sure what a program is, you can right-click it and either select Properties to open its Properties dialog box or select Search online to find more information on the Web. As a bonus, the Startup tab can also be a useful place to look if you suspect your system may have some malware, but we'll save that discussion for a little later.

Figure 16-11  Startup tab in Task Manager

Once you've reviewed the list and decided which apps are essential to run at startup, it's time to get your computer back up to "ludicrous speed" where it belongs. It's as simple as right-clicking the app you want to disable and clicking Disable. Don't worry if you decide later that you want to use the app after all; you can always launch it normally from the Start menu or a desktop shortcut.

NOTE   There is always the possibility that a sluggish system is being slowed down by malware. If you can't find an obvious cause for the slowdown, it is a good idea to run a virus scan---just in case.

Boot Problems

Most failed-boot scenarios require you to determine where the fault occurred: with the hardware and configuration, or in Windows. Boot problems are pretty straightforward. Imagine that a user calls and says "My PC won't boot" or "My computer is dead." At this point, your best tools are knowledge of the boot process and asking lots of questions. Here are some I use regularly:

-   "What displays on the screen---if anything---after you press the power button on the case?"

-   "What do you hear---if anything---after you press the power button on the case?"

-   "Is the PC plugged in?"

-   "Do you smell anything weird?"

Hardware problems can give you a blank screen on boot-up, so you follow the tried-and-true troubleshooting methodology for hardware. Make sure everything is plugged in and turned on.

If the user says that the screen says "No boot device detected" and the system worked fine before, it could mean something as simple as the computer has attempted to boot to an incorrect device, such as to something other than the primary hard drive. This scenario happens all the time. Someone plugs a thumb drive into a USB port and the CMOS is configured to boot to removable media before hard drives---boom! "No boot device detected" error. The first few times it happened to me, I nearly took my machine apart before experiencing that head-slapping moment. I removed the thumb drive and then watched Windows boot normally.

Frequent Shutdowns

If you have used Windows for any amount of time, there is about a 99 percent chance that you have experienced a sudden shutdown. This can be extremely frustrating, not only because of lost time, but also because it poses the very real possibility of lost work. The problem gets worse when you start to experience frequent shutdowns. There are several possible causes, but on the software side there are three biggies.

Fast Startup

Windows has a feature called fast startup that, as the name implies, allows your computer to boot up quicker than normal. However, fast is not always better. One example of this has to do with drivers. If your system has a lot of drivers installed, fast startup may not give them all enough time or resources to boot properly and, as a result, they will crash. In turn, this will cause Windows to shut down at some random point thereafter. You can disable fast startup but you have to go through a bit of a maze to get there, so let's walk through it together.

In Windows 10, go to Settings | System | Power & sleep. Once you're in the Power & sleep menu, look for the Related settings section and click Additional power settings. In the Power Options window that opens, click Choose what the power buttons do on the left and then click Change settings that are currently unavailable. Under Shutdown settings, uncheck the Turn on fast startup (recommended) checkbox (see Figure 16-12) and then click the Save changes button to save your changes. See what I meant when I said it was a bit of a maze? That was a lot of different menus!

Figure 16-12  Turning off fast startup

Sleep Mode

Sleep mode is intended to save power when you are away from your computer. However, sometimes your computer might shut down instead of going to sleep. So, if you notice that Windows is shutting down while you are away from your computer, this is the likely culprit. When this is the case, you will want to disable sleep mode.

To do this in Windows 11, go to Settings | System | Power & battery. On this screen you will see two drop-down menus under Screen and sleep: On battery power, PC goes to sleep after and When plugged in, PC goes to sleep after. Set both menus to Never, as shown in Figure 16-13.

Figure 16-13  Setting sleep mode to Never

EXAM TIP   The CompTIA A+ 1102 exam objectives want you to know about something else you can do with these power options. Choose what closing the lid does enables you to configure a laptop to automatically shut down, sleep, hibernate---or even keep on running---when you close the lid. You might want to use different options if you use your laptop on the go rather than stationary on your desk all day.

Driver Problems

If neither of the previous solutions resolves the issue of frequent shutdowns, it is likely that you have an issue with a driver. Specifically, you may have a driver that needs updated or you have a driver that has become corrupted. Follow the same procedure you used for unruly drivers back in the "Blue Screen of Death" section.

Services Not Starting

Windows loads many services as it starts. In a scenario where a critical service fails to start, Windows informs you with an error message. The important word here is critical. Windows will not report all service failures at this point. If a service that is less than critical to Windows doesn't start, the OS usually waits until you try to use a program that needs that service before it prompts you with an error message (see Figure 16-14).

Figure 16-14  Service error

To work with your system's services, go to the Control Panel | Administrative Tools | Services and verify that the service you need is running. If not, restart the service. Also notice that each service has a Startup Type---Automatic, Manual, or Disabled---that defines when it starts. It's very common to find that a service has been set to Manual when it needs to be set to Automatic so that it starts when Windows boots (see Figure 16-15).

Figure 16-15  Autostarting a service

Applications Crashing

Occasionally, an application gets released that isn't ready for prime time and bugs in the code cause the application or even the operating system to crash. I've seen this most often with games rushed to market near the winter holidays. The results of this rushed code can be pretty spectacular. You're right in the middle of a thrilling fight with the bad guy and then what happens? A crash to desktop (CTD).

Poorly written or buggy programs and device drivers can have awful effects on you and your clients. Some of the scenarios caused by such programs are the computer locking up or unexpectedly shutting down. The system might spontaneously shut down and restart. That kind of improper shutdown can cause problems---especially if a program was in the middle of editing an important file!

The problem here is that these crashes can also be caused by hardware. You've got to keep in mind all of these things as you approach troubleshooting a crash. Look out for more on hardware causes later in the chapter.

Low Memory Warnings

Imagine you are listening to music, writing a report in Word, and have a few dozen too many browser tabs open for research. All of the sudden you get a low memory warning, or more specifically, a message pops up that says "Your computer is low on memory."

Wait. How can that be? Is my RAM going bad? The answer is usually that the running programs are using nearly all of your system's available memory. So, what do you do? The easiest thing is to close tabs and applications that you don't need---but if an open program is suffering from a memory leak, you may have to reboot to get a fresh start.

There is also a more precise way of evaluating what is hogging your system's memory. Open the Processes tab in the Task Manager and click the Memory column head to arrange running processes by the amount of RAM they are using. If you locate an app that is using too much memory, right-click on it and select End task.

EXAM TIP   If you are dealing with an application that is hogging memory or locked up on macOS, you can use Force Quit to close it. You can access Force Quit by selecting Force Quit from the Apple menu, by holding the OPTION key and right-clicking the app in the Dock, or via the Activity Monitor app.

USB Controller Resource Warnings

Sometimes you will see USB controller resource warnings, or more specifically, a message pop up that says "Not Enough USB Controller Resources." Most of the time there is a very simple reason for this message---you have too many things plugged into your USB ports. This happens because USB controllers have a fixed number of communication channels, each of which is known as an endpoint. Think of endpoints as lanes on a highway.

On a highway that is ten lanes wide, traffic will flow normally as long as the amount of traffic does not exceed the ten-lane capacity. Some devices will require more than one lane to travel on this "highway." So, imagine that you have three pieces of hardware that each require four lanes and they are trying to run on the ten-lane highway---at this point you don't have enough USB controller resources.

To fix the problem, you will have to assess what devices you have connected and potentially disconnect some. If your system has a mix of USB versions, it may help to move some USB 3.0 devices to a USB 2.0 port or vice versa. If you have to choose, reserve the higher-version ports for high-bandwidth devices like storage drives or video interfaces.

System Instability

System instability is something of a catch-all term. Even in perfectly configured systems there will be occasional errors, but when those errors start to become more frequent and more diverse, we can say that the system is unstable. These types of errors can be occurring in the OS, apps, or various other places. Plus, the older a system gets, the more likely it is to experience stability issues.

It's easy enough to know if your own system is unstable by just paying careful attention to it. But how do you determine this if it's not your system? Fortunately, Reliability Monitor in Windows can give you a quick overview of how often the system locks up or crashes. To open it, go to the Control Panel | Security and Maintenance, click the Maintenance drop-down arrow, and click View reliability history. Reliability Monitor generates a report and displays it in the default Days view (see Figure 16-16). This lets you see all the errors that have occurred on each day over the last few weeks.

Figure 16-16  Reliability Monitor

As shown on the right side of Figure 16-16, the graph has several categories, including Application failures, Windows failures, Miscellaneous failures, Warnings, and Information. In addition to the types of errors, you will also be able to see when they are occurring and get additional information. In short, blue circle icons with an i are informational and not indicative of problems. A red circle icon with an × indicates where something bad went wrong. A yellow triangle icon with an ! denotes where a warning occurred. Therefore, when you see lots of recuring red and yellow icons, it's a clear indication that a system is potentially unstable. Checking Reliability Monitor isn't a perfect way gauge system stability, but it is a good place to keep tabs on the general health of your system and diagnose emerging problems.

No OS Found

The first time you see this error message, it will likely make you panic a little---I sure did! It's pretty unnerving to think that your OS and data might be gone, but the key is to remain calm and work through this systematically. Back in Chapter 14 we discussed the single best way to beat back this sense of dread: regularly back up your data and confirm that you can recover a working system from it. Having rock-solid confidence that you'll be able to recover whatever was on the system makes it way easier to focus on the problem.

Back in Chapter 5, we discussed how the system firmware (aka BIOS) looks for an OS to boot from. If it can't find one, then it displays an "Operating system not found" error. Some causes are relatively simple to resolve, like bad BIOS configurations, while others can be related to a dying or dead hard drive. Here are a few common tactics/steps that you can use to troubleshoot and fix the underlying problem.

First, verify whether you (or someone else) left any new removable media (such as a flash drive or optical disc) in the system. If so, see if the system boots correctly without it connected. If it boots right up, the system is trying to boot from removable media that isn't bootable. If it doesn't, you should reboot and enter the system setup utility to confirm that the hard drive containing your OS comes first in the boot sequence (which is also called the boot priority or boot order).

As a quick refresher, accessing the system setup utility varies from manufacturer to manufacturer. It usually requires pressing ESC, DEL, or one of the FN keys during the boot process. A quick search online should identify which key your PC uses. For more details on accessing the system setup utility and changing the boot sequence, refer back to Chapter 5.

NOTE   If your hard drive doesn't even show up in the system setup utility, make sure it's connected correctly. If that doesn't help, try resetting the system setup utility's settings to default. If you still don't see your hard drive, it's probably having hardware issues (which will require an entirely different type of troubleshooting and potentially expert repair).

If the correct drive is already first in the boot sequence, the master boot record we talked about back in Chapter 9 may be corrupt and need to be rebuilt. First, boot to a Windows recovery drive (or installation media) and navigate to the System Recovery Options that you read about earlier in this chapter in the "Recovering When Windows Breaks" section. From here, you have two options: the easy way and the quick way.

The easy way is to just launch the Startup Repair utility and go do something else while it runs. I recommended the easy way, but if you're feeling impatient, you can do this a little faster if you're willing to roll up your sleeves and learn the bootrec and bcdedit commands. I'm not going to go into detail here because you won't see these commands on the CompTIA A+ 1102 exam.

Slow Profile Load

As I discussed earlier in the "Rebuild Windows Profiles" section, user profiles are a very useful part of Windows, but they can start to load slowly (or not at all) if they get corrupted. This can be a drag on its own, but combine it with some of the causes of sluggish performance we dealt with earlier in the chapter, and it becomes a real nuisance.

Earlier, in the "Frequent Shutdowns" section, we discussed how sometimes Fast startup can cause problems because there are too many processes trying to start at once. That is also a possibility here, so first disable Fast startup if it's enabled and see if this makes any difference in load time.

Another possibility is that there is too much stuff on your desktop. We have all been there---it is easy to create a new file and place the copy on your desktop, swearing that you will put it in the proper folder later. However, later never seems to come and the next thing you know you have a few gigs of data on your desktop. Try temporarily moving these files into a folder that isn't on your desktop to see if it helps.

If none of these did the trick, it's time to turn to the procedure that I laid out in the "Rebuild Windows Profiles" section earlier in the chapter.

Time Drift

A lot of people who haven't looked under the hood take the concept of "time" for granted. If you've ever noticed the time on something like a wall or stove clock drifting slowly out of step with the time your cellphone shows, you've brushed up against a fundamental truth: all clocks drift apart, and the best we can do is resynchronize them occasionally.

The clock inside every computer is subject to time drift (also known as clock drift) and slowly diverges from the actual time (and may do so more rapidly when the system works hard). Since many applications are dependent on precise time measurements, time drift can cause applications to not start, crash, or perform poorly. Because security protocols frequently use keys that expire after a certain amount of time, it can also cause security and login problems.

To keep their clocks mostly right, modern operating systems regularly (once a week for Windows) synchronize with time servers that exist just for this purpose. Microsoft has set up its own at time.windows.com. As long as time drift isn't causing trouble, it's usually okay to ignore it between syncs. If you have systems suffering enough time drift to cause problems---or you notice that the gap continues to grow---there are a few things to consider.

If the systems are continuing to drift beyond a week, they may not be configured (or able) to communicate with the time server. The easy way to check this is to open the Time & Language category in the Settings app, ensure that Set time automatically is enabled, and click Sync now to see if the process completes. If it can't reach the time server, it'll show a spinner for a few minutes and then a "Time synchronization failed" message (as shown in Figure 16-17); this likely indicates that the system is offline or network settings need adjustment (which we'll discuss in detail in Chapters 18 through 21).

Figure 16-17  A failed time synchronization

If the time synchronizes just fine but the system keeps experiencing time-related problems, it may be a hardware issue (see the upcoming "Inaccurate System Date/Time" section).

EXAM TIP   I don't think CompTIA will expect you to be able to troubleshoot network-related time synchronization failures on the A+ 1102 exam. If they did, the right answers probably involve ensuring the system is using a well-known time server (like time.windows.com) or using the ping command to verify that the time server is reachable. Keep an eye out for ping in Chapters 18--21.

Troubleshooting Problems Related to Motherboard, CPU, RAM, and Power

So far in this chapter, we have discussed problems related to the OS and applications from a software perspective. Unfortunately, trouble with the hardware in your system can cause many of the same symptoms---and to be a good troubleshooter, you need to be able to recognize when you can and can't rule out hardware problems.

In the early chapters of this book, we discussed how computers are built and how each component plays a critical role in maintaining the overall health of the system. We covered CPUs in Chapter 3, RAM in Chapter 4, motherboards in Chapter 6, and power supplies in Chapter 7. Each chapter included a "Troubleshooting" section in which I called out common symptoms and problems related to the component covered in that chapter. For easy review, I want to close out this chapter by taking a moment to sweep up several hardware problems related to motherboards, CPUs, RAM, and power that you'll need to recognize for the 1101 exam.

Power-On Self-Test

As we discussed in Chapter 5, when you start your PC, it runs through the power-on self-test (POST) that checks your computer's hardware to make sure everything is working correctly before booting the OS. If the computer passes the POST, you will mostly likely hear a single beep and then Windows will start booting. If a component fails the POST, you will either hear a beep code (a sequence of beeps) or, on some of the more recent motherboards, see the power light or internal LED blinking. Check your motherboard's manual for details on what the beep codes, also known as POST codes, mean for your PC and then start troubleshooting the problem component.

Proprietary Crash Screens

In the first part of this chapter, we discussed the BSoD from a software perspective, with an emphasis on bad drivers or applications. However, a BSoD that occurs during the initial boot sequence could also be caused by bad hardware, with drivers being a leading culprit. As was the case with software, be systematic in testing components, removing only one at a time, starting with any that were recently installed. macOS systems display a spinning pinwheel (also called a beachball) to indicate an issue.

EXAM TIP   The CompTIA A+ 1101 exam objectives list this symptom as proprietary crash screens (blue screen of death [BSOD]/pinwheel). Be prepared to see all three of these terms together, or to know that they're all associated if you see them separately!

Black Screen

Though it is far from the worst thing that could go wrong, a black (or blank) screen can be extremely frustrating because it provides absolutely no information suggesting what the problem might be. So, if your computer is powered on but you are seeing a black screen, where do you start?

EXAM TIP   We'll take a much closer look at all kinds of hardware- and software-related display and graphics troubleshooting issues in Chapter 17. In this section, I'll keep the focus on basic hardware issues pertaining to your motherboard, RAM, CPU, and power.

If the computer was running fine earlier and the screen has suddenly gone black, confirm that the monitor is plugged in, turned on, and properly connected to your computer. These may seem like no-brainer checks, but modern video cables don't have screw mounts like the old ones---a pet or a user with restless legs can easily knock one loose.

If it's not the monitor, see if it comes back on after a reboot. If so, leave it alone until it happens regularly. A one-time occurrence could be the computer's fault, but it can also be caused by something like a power fluctuation. It's annoying, but it's worse to spend tons of time troubleshooting and fiddling with options, think you've fixed it, only to be confused when it happens few months later during a bad storm.

If the cables seem fine and the monitor is powered on, connecting it to a different system is a quick way to sort out whether the display or the computer is to blame. It's also worth trying a different set of known-good cables in case those are the problem. If it's the cables, replace them. If it's the display, stay tuned for more display-specific troubleshooting in Chapter 17.

When it seems like the computer is the problem, a black screen usually indicates that some hardware is misconfigured, misconnected, or not working. If you are hearing or seeing any of the POST codes discussed earlier, follow the procedure for troubleshooting POST codes.

If you don't hear or see a POST code but you've been tinkering inside your case lately, ensure any components you touched are properly connected. If you added a component, see if the display comes on without it. Booting a system with the RAM mis-seated (or with no RAM at all), for example, can cause the computer to power on, issue no POST codes, but never boot up.

We'll talk more about the difference between integrated and dedicated graphics in Chapter 17, but one more common issue arises when you're trying to use a video connector on the motherboard but the integrated graphics are disabled in the system setup. In this case, consult your motherboard manual and perform a CMOS reset (this will restore the default settings, which should have the integrated graphics enabled).

No Power

You press the power button and nothing happens. What do you do now? First, make sure that that wall socket is getting electricity, your computer is plugged in, surge suppressors are turned to the on position, and the power cord is properly plugged in to the computer.

Next, open your system and verify that the CPU and motherboard cables are connected. If all of these things are hooked up correctly and nothing happens when you press the power button, look for indicator lights on the motherboard. If you don't see anything, then you likely have a bad power supply.

If you do see indicator lights on the motherboard, things get a little more complicated. However, you should move on to checking that your front-panel button is connected properly. Look inside your case near the front panel for a small bundle of wires that connects to your motherboard to enable the power button, front USB ports, and any number of other ports and features your specific case may have. The connector typically has two rows of pins and is encased in a plastic box. Remove the side panel on your computer and make sure the cable is tightly connected.

If your system starts but fails to boot, refer to the previous section on POST. If nothing happens, you likely have additional hardware issues and may need to take a closer look at the hardware.

Sluggish Performance

In the first part of this chapter, we discussed how preventing apps from running at startup can improve performance. Unfortunately, just about every component in a computer can fail suddenly or fail slowly---and slowly failing components often cause performance or stability problems.

NOTE   In this section I'm assuming that you've already followed the steps for troubleshooting software-related sluggishness. This includes adding resources such as additional RAM or a newer CPU if the system isn't meeting your needs. In the real world, you'll be simultaneously considering software and hardware causes of sluggishness.

If the sluggishness started after you installed new hardware, disconnect the new device and uninstall the associated driver. If your system speeds up, you have found the cause. The manufacturer's Web site may provide a new driver or another workaround so that you can go on happily using their product.

If you haven't changed anything and the sluggishness is new, you'll want to check up on your existing components. Since overheating can cause sluggish performance, a good place to start is by following the recommendations in the next section, "Overheating." Beyond heat issues, you need to see if individual components are failing.

I like to keep in stock some spare known-good components like RAM modules, CPUs, hard drives, and motherboards for both emergency repairs and troubleshooting unexplained performance problems. I also keep a spare working system to swap the components into. Work one component at a time. I like to start with the RAM because it's easiest---but go with your gut after that.

TIP   If you want to make an investment in your own future sanity, pick out one or more computer performance benchmark suites, occasionally run them on your systems, and keep a copy of the results. It's a bit of extra work, but having a few snapshots of how the device used to perform can enable you to diagnose a failing component by just rerunning the benchmark suite and comparing the results.

Overheating

If your computer starts freezing up, randomly shutting down or restarting, making strange noises, or displaying strange graphical glitches, and you can feel heat radiating off of it, you are probably dealing with overheating. When a computer starts to overheat, ensure it is well ventilated. Check that all the vents are clear and not blocked by pet hair or other obstructions. (May you never see the matted mess that cat hair can make of a computer's vents and heatsinks!)

Make sure you're grounded, as discussed in Chapter 1, and open the computer to give it a good cleaning. Dust and hair building up over the years can form a component-smothering blanket. Use a can of compressed air to give the system a good cleaning, paying particular attention to areas around the vents, fan, and power supply.

Once all the vents and fans are clean and clear and the system has had a good cleaning, ensure that there aren't other sources of heat near the system.

NOTE   Consider using compressed air on a particularly dusty computer only if you are outside or in a well-ventilated area that will be easy to clean up afterward.

If a good dusting doesn't help, check the fans (not just your case fans---but also any on components inside). Over time, fans can begin to run slowly and seize up. An easy way to tell if your fan is bad is to unplug it and spin it with your finger. If it stops suddenly or slows down too quickly, you likely need a new one. Other signs are if the fan makes any strange noise, visibly wobbles, or obviously runs slower than other fans in the case. The good news is that fans are cheap.

If the system is running hot, you should also notice the fans spinning faster as it warms. Listen closely when you're gaming or doing other processing-intensive tasks; can you hear the fans spin up and get louder? If not, make sure the system setup utility is set to ramp up fan speeds when things start to get hot.

Once you've made sure that the PC is clean and the fans are spinning and installed correctly, it's a good idea to keep an eye on the actual temperature of the CPU and GPU (these generate a lot of heat and are most likely to be damaged by overheating). You can usually check the CPU temp in the system setup utility, but you can't really do this while you're playing a game or editing a movie. There are many free utilities you can use to keep an eye on the CPU and GPU temps when performing processing-intensive tasks. One of my favorites is HWiNFO64.

Burning Smell

When overheating reaches a critical stage, you may notice a burning smell. It may remind you of an electrical fire, melting plastic, some combination of the two, or another "hot" smell. Regardless, your nose will tell you when something is on fire. This can be a symptom of both extreme overheating and a sudden electrical failure.

If you're in the room when this happens, disconnect the system from power ASAP and observe it for long enough to know whether opening the case is safe. Don't open it if it's actively smoking (and get your handy-dandy Class C fire extinguisher ready).

NOTE   This is, in my mind, where cases with one or more big windows are worth whatever they cost. It's hard to put a price on being able to quickly confirm whether there's an active fire!

Once you're sure nothing is on fire, open the case to investigate (but be careful---accumulated dust or a critically overheated component could catch fire when exposed to the inflow of oxygen). Move your hand around the components without touching them to identify any hot spots (focus on the CPU, GPU, and anything else with a fan). If nothing feels unusually hot, see if you can sniff out where the offending smell is coming from.

If there was smoke but neither of these steps locates a source, you need to visually inspect any dust for signs of burning, dust the computer out, break it down, and visually inspect every component for scorch marks (often around connectors and capacitors). You do not want to try to boot up a computer with electrical damage, so I recommend treating everything in the computer as a loss unless you can locate an obvious cause of the smoke.

Frequent Shutdowns

Earlier in this chapter we looked at several software issues that can cause frequent shutdowns, but hardware issues can cause the same problem. Rule out the easy things first. If a system starts to overheat, it should thermal throttle or even shut itself down to avoid damage or fire. These measures might not be enough, so it's still a good idea to check for overheating.

Since most systems will automatically reboot after they encounter a proprietary crash screen such as a BSoD, it's a good idea to investigate whether these crashes are at fault. Shutdowns can also be a side-effect of instability caused by problems in the motherboard firmware. If random or frequent reboots have always been a problem, or they start right after a firmware update, look for a newer version or flash the firmware you were using previously. (For more on this process, refer to "Flashing the ROM" in Chapter 5.)

Just like sluggish performance, frequent shutdowns can also be a sign of slowly failing hardware, so the recommendations in the "Sluggish Performance" section may help identify a troublesome component.

If none of the previously described items are the cause of frequent shutdowns, check all connections to make sure there is not a short or loose connector. Finally, dust and corrosion can wreak havoc long before that. Dust or corrosion in motherboard slots (mainly RAM and PCIe) or on the component pins themselves can also cause flaky connections and occasional shutdowns. This is where careful cleaning comes in. Depending on the contaminant, the cleaning tool of choice might be compressed air and a microfiber cloth, a cotton swap with a dab of isopropyl alcohol on it, or even a pencil eraser (it can help clean the gold-plated contacts, but I always treat this as a last recourse).

Application Crashes

We looked at software issues that can cause application crashes earlier in the chapter, but hardware issues can cause the same problem. Suppose you're playing a graphically intensive game, when the screen and Windows both lock up. As we saw earlier, the program might just be buggy, but it could also be the case that the video card is slowly failing and throws a fit when you push it too hard. It could be that the system accessed a section of RAM that has gone bad.

You've already confirmed that software isn't causing the problem, so you should rule out problems like overheating and loose connectors. If the problem is happening regularly, the best way to figure out which component is causing the problem is to swap them out one by one with a known good component until the problem goes away.

Grinding Noise

You turn on your computer and you hear a grinding noise. Nothing strikes fear in the heart of both car and computer owners like unexpected metallic grinding noises. Luckily, there are only two things in modern computers that make this type of noise: fans and traditional magnetic hard drives.

If you have only solid-state drives, then you immediately know it is a fan---you don't have to worry about a catastrophic loss of data. If you have a traditional magnetic hard drive or more than one fan, you'll need to open the case and listen carefully to identify where the grinding is coming from. It can also help to place a finger on the outside of a hard drive or fan to feel for vibrations.

In both cases, the result is the same: the component is on its way out and you should promptly replace it.

NOTE   If it's the hard drive, you'll also need to consider its data. When was the last backup? What might you lose if you replace the drive now? If there is critical data on the drive that you don't have backed up, shut off the computer until you're ready to back up the drive. (A hard drive making this noise might last for months---or minutes.) If it's a boot drive, I'd attach it to another system to perform the backup. It could fail at any time, and the extra stress of booting the OS from it isn't worth the risk!

Capacitor Swelling

In the world of motherboards, a capacitor is a tiny electrical component that helps regulate the voltage going to other components, like video cards and hard drives, to prevent power spikes from damaging them. Age, overcurrent, and design or manufacturing defects can all cause capacitors to bulge (usually at the top)---and the CompTIA A+ 1101 exam objectives refer to this as capacitor swelling. Capacitors can even split open and leak some of the chemicals inside.

As part of routine cleaning, you should examine capacitors on the motherboard for bulges. If you see any, it is time to either replace the motherboard or send it off for service. (You can technically replace a capacitor yourself if you're comfortable with a soldering gun---but that's well beyond what you'll need to know for the CompTIA A+ 1101 exam!)

NOTE   Since we usually don't peek inside smaller devices such as laptops and cellphones, it's good to keep an eye out for bumps or bulges in the case of these devices. It might be swollen capacitors---but the lithium batteries contained within our laptops and phones can also swell (and potentially burst into flames). We will go over that specific problem in Chapter 23.

Inaccurate System Date/Time

Small discrepancies between the time your computer and other devices report usually come down to time drift, covered earlier in this chapter, but large discrepancies (months or even years) tend to have a completely different cause: the CMOS battery. As we discussed back in Chapter 5, the CMOS battery powers the storage for a number of values---including the time---while the system is completely off. Refer back to the procedure in the "Losing CMOS RTC Settings" section in Chapter 5 for more details on how to replace the CMOS battery.

CHAPTER 17

Display Technologies

In this chapter, you will learn how to

-   Summarize different display technologies

-   Understand how computers display and capture video

-   Install and configure video

-   Troubleshoot basic video problems

The term video encompasses a complex interaction among numerous parts of personal computing devices, all designed to put a picture on the screen. The monitor or video display shows you what's going on with your programs and operating system. It's the primary output device for most devices. The display adapter handles communication between the CPU and the monitor or display (see Figure 17-1). The operating system needs to know how to handle communication between the CPU and the display adapter, which requires installing drivers specific to each card.

Figure 17-1  Typical monitor and video card

All of these components fall into the category of display technologies. This chapter explores monitors, video displays, and display adapters, discusses how to troubleshoot a variety of display issues, and closes with a look at some topics you won't find on the exam---including a review of the display qualities and features you should know in order to understand and compare product listings.

Video displays for computing devices come in three varieties: flat-panel displays, projectors, and virtual reality headsets. Almost every modern personal computer uses a flat-panel display, and there's a pair of similar display panels mounted inside serious virtual reality headsets. You'll find projectors in boardrooms and classrooms, splashing a picture onto a screen. This section explores the technology variations in video displays and describes the connection options.

Flat-Panel Displays

Almost every computing device today uses some sort of flat-panel display as the primary visual output component. Because standalone monitors don't have to be replaced along with the rest of the computer, it's good to keep in mind that there are always some pretty old displays still in service.

The industry is always hard at work to create displays that are thinner, faster, prettier, and more efficient, but the biggest leaps usually come after an innovative new display technology is finally good enough or cheap enough to dominate the market. Once we hit that tipping point, things can change quickly! This also means we can see exciting headlines about new display technologies for years---decades, even---without them ever becoming common in desktop monitors.

When the first desktop computers stole our hearts, they did it despite bulky, heavy monitors with tiny (by modern standards) cathode-ray tube (CRT) displays---the same technology used in TVs at the time. CRTs ruled our desktops for decades---from the 1970s up through the early 2000s---when flat-panel displays dethroned them (a little over a decade after the first models appeared).

The early flat-panel displays incorporated a liquid crystal display (LCD) panel---and LCD monitors still hold the crown despite a healthy challenge from organic light-emitting diode (OLED) panels. Let's take a closer look at both of these panel technologies.

NOTE   See the "MicroLED" discussion in Beyond A+ for a look at a potential competitor to LCD and OLED. We'll also revisit OLED in Chapter 24 in the context of mobile devices.

LCD Panels

A color LCD screen is composed of tiny liquid crystal molecules (called sub-pixels) arranged in rows and columns between polarizing filters. When electric current is applied to the liquid crystal molecules, they act as a shutter to enable light to pass through. A translucent sheet above the sub-pixels is colored red, green, or blue. Each tiny distinct group of three sub-pixels---one red, one green, and one blue---forms a physical pixel, as shown in Figure 17-2.

Figure 17-2  LCD pixels

Current LCD monitors use some form of thin film transistor (TFT) or active matrix technology (see Figure 17-3) with one or more tiny transistors to control each color dot, providing faster picture display, crisp definition, and much tighter color control than the earliest LCD panels could provide.

Figure 17-3  Active matrix display

The typical LCD monitor is composed of two main components: an LCD panel to create the image, and a backlight to illuminate the image so you can see it. Some older models need inverters to send power to backlights that require alternating current (AC) electricity. Figure 17-4 shows a typical layout for the internal components of an older LCD monitor.

Figure 17-4  LCD components

LCD Panel Technologies  LCD panel manufacturers use a lot of variation in things like the orientation of the liquid crystal molecules within the glass substrates and the underlying electronics to try to create displays that respond quickly to user demands and show accurate color and details. The three most common panel types today are twisted nematic (TN), in-plane switching (IPS), and vertical alignment (VA).

Technically, TN panels are the fastest but offer adequate color; IPS panels display beautiful color at slower speeds; and VA panels fall somewhere in between the two in terms of responsiveness and color accuracy. In reality, the steady march of technological improvement has left us with IPS displays that are fast enough for most purposes.

NOTE   Samsung offers a proprietary version of IPS called Plane to Line Switching (PLS). Samsung claims PLS is better, naturally, though it functions very similarly to IPS and can be considered an IPS variation.

Backlights  Backlights light up the panel, as mentioned, but vary according to the technology used and the implementation of the lighting. Current LCDs use light-emitting diode (LED) technology for backlights; early generations used cold cathode fluorescent lamp (CCFL).These modern monitors are marketed as LED displays to differentiate them from the older CCFL panels. LEDs took over from CCFLs because LEDs use DC electricity (just like the logic boards and panels in LCDs), consume much less electricity, and give off little heat. LEDs enable super thin screens like you see on almost every computing device today, from smartphones to tablets to desktop monitors. Figure 17-5 shows an illustration of a typical modern LCD (note the inverters missing from the previous figure).

Figure 17-5  Modern LCD internals

The LCD illustrated in Figure 17-5 has two backlights: one at the top and one at the bottom. That's a typical implementation for backlights, called edge LED backlighting. The drawback is that you can sometimes see that the edges are a little brighter than the center.

Direct LED backlighting puts a bank of LEDs behind the panel, providing better uniformity of image. This is more expensive and uses more electricity than edge backlighting, but it's becoming more common on higher-end LCD televisions and filtering into computer monitors as well.

NOTE   You'll find a variety of improvements to direct LED backlighting technologies in real displays (none of which are included in the exam objectives). Mini LED, for example, uses smaller LEDs to better control how the display is lit. Quantum dots (QD) are also sometimes used to improve the overall color accuracy and brightness of the display.

OLED Panels

OLED screens use organic compounds between the glass layers that light up when given an electrical charge. Since they emit their own light, they don't require backlight---and this makes them perfect for ultra-thin, energy-efficient displays. OLED pixels can turn off completely, enabling pure black and thus phenomenal contrast compared with LCD panels.

OLED is generally more expensive than LCD, so much of its success has been limited to a small number of niches. Since OLED first started appearing in teeny-tiny displays in the early 2000s, it has built up three niches where it is most competitive: high-end televisions, viewfinders for mirrorless interchangeable lens cameras, and small mobile/wearable devices (including smart watches, smartphones, and virtual reality headsets).

After a few false starts, OLED panels finally started turning up in a growing number of laptops and desktop monitors in the late 2010s and early 2020s. There's a decent chance you'll need to support users with OLED displays, but the continued evolution of LCD technology makes me skeptical that OLED will ever wear the crown.

NOTE   OLED displays have created an exciting learning opportunity for early adopters (and those using massive OLED TVs as monitors) who missed tough lessons we learned with older CRT and plasma displays. Much like these earlier technologies, OLED panels have image retention problems that are exacerbated by using them as computer monitors. We'll take a closer look at these image retention issues in the "Troubleshooting Monitors" section.

Projectors

Projectors generate an image in one device and then use light to throw (or project) it onto a screen or some other object. You'll mostly encounter front-view projectors, which shoot an image out the front and count on you to place a screen in front at the proper distance. Front-view projectors connected to PCs running Microsoft PowerPoint have been the cornerstone of every meeting almost everywhere since the 1990s (see Figure 17-6). This section deals exclusively with front-view projectors that connect to PCs.

Figure 17-6  Front-view projector (photo courtesy of Dell Inc.)

Much like monitors, projector technologies evolve over time. Their two main needs are also similar: generating an image, and generating enough light to project the image onto distant objects. I'll give you a quick overview of the most-common image technologies, and then we'll focus a little more closely on three things you should understand about the process of generating and projecting tons of light: lumens, throw, and light sources.

Image Technologies

It may sound like the exciting part of the process, but most modern projectors generate the image in one of two ways, and you're already pretty familiar with one of them by now! Given that light shines through an LCD panel, LCD projectors (see Figure 17-7) are a natural fit for front projection. Just like their monitor equivalent, LCD projectors have a specific native resolution.

Figure 17-7  LCD projector (photo courtesy of ViewSonic)

The other main option, proprietary Digital Light Processing (DLP) technology from Texas Instruments, uses an array of tiny mirrors to project a front-view image. The technology differs substantially from LCD. DLP projectors produce better color and a softer image than LCD. DLP projectors also tend to weigh less than LCD projectors.

Lumens

The brightness of a projector is expressed in lumens, a measure of the amount of visible light given off by a light source. A higher number of lumens means a brighter projector, but the "right" lumen rating depends on the size of the room and how dark it will be when the projector is in use. There's no single answer, but use this as a rough guide: If you use a projector in a small, dark room, 1000 to 1500 lumens will work well. If you use a projector in a mid-sized room with typical lighting, you'll need at least 2000 lumens. Projectors for large rooms have ratings over 10,000 lumens and are very expensive.

Throw

A projector's throw indicates the size of the image at a certain distance from the screen. All projectors have a recommended minimum and maximum throw distance that you need to take into consideration. Throw is expressed in terms of the distance between a video projector lens and the screen on which it shines. For example, for an 80-inch diagonal screen, a standard-throw projector needs to be 132--144 inches feet away from the projection surface. A short-throw projector needs just 48 inches, and an ultra-short-throw projector needs a mere 15 inches away (although such a lens is expensive). Figure 17-8 illustrates the different throw distances.

Figure 17-8  Projector throw variations

Light Sources

Most projectors use one of three light sources: powerful light bulbs, LEDs, or lasers.

Lamps---light bulbs that produce a lot of lumens in a small form factor---have been the standard for a long time. They're also the bane of traditional projectors. They produce tons of heat, have to warm up before you can use them, need a noisy fan to cool them off both while the projector runs and after you turn it off, and only last about 3000 hours. Replacement lamps are also expensive, usually in the range of a few hundred dollars (U.S.).

LED-based projectors don't generate as much heat, so their fans are smaller and quieter. LED projectors used to cost more than lamp-based ones, but that price difference has narrowed. They haven't historically offered nearly as many lumens (they typically require a much darker room), but they have also narrowed this gap over the years. LED light sources also have long lifespans of 30,000+ hours.

Laser-based projectors produce vibrant, high-contrast images. Laser-based projectors are currently more expensive than competing technologies, but the price is coming down, and laser light source can last 20,000+ hours.

TIP   You may also see LED and laser-based light sources referred to as light engines, light modules, or similar. Since they don't need a long warm-up time, projectors with these light sources are ready to work more or less instantly. The light source may or may not be replaceable.

Common Display Features

All standalone video displays share characteristics that you need to know for purchase, installation, maintenance, and troubleshooting. They vary in connection types, on-screen controls for adjustments, mounting brackets, and additional features such as built-in USB hubs, webcams, speakers, and microphones.

Connections

Standalone displays have one or more connectors (most often on the back) for connecting them to a video source. I want to zoom out to talk about connector versions, and then I'll show you each of the connectors you're likely to see in the wild.

Much like USB, modern video connector standards (HDMI, DisplayPort, and Thunderbolt) are occasionally updated with new versions as the technology improves. You don't need to know about these versions for the CompTIA A+ exams, but you will need to have them in mind any time you're purchasing, installing, or troubleshooting displays.

NOTE   Legacy connectors such as VGA and DVI don't have versions to keep track of.

To take full advantage of the bandwidth and features of the latest version of a standard, your display, cable, and video source must all support at least that version. You should also pay careful attention to the bandwidth and features supported by the different connectors on both the video source and display. For example, a given video source or monitor might have three different connectors, but only one may support the device's highest refresh rate and resolution---and only if the video source, cable, and display all support this refresh rate and resolution.

VGA  Video Graphics Array (VGA) is as old as the hills by this point, but you'll still find a 15-pin, three-row, D-type connector (see Figure 17-9) on quite a few monitors. This legacy connector has a lot of names, including D-shell and D-subminiature, but most people simply call it the VGA connector. VGA is the oldest and least-capable monitor connection type.

Figure 17-9  A VGA connector

DVI  The Digital Visual Interface (DVI) standard helped build a bridge between the world of old analog displays and modern digital ones (and even served as the foundation of HDMI, which we'll discuss next). DVI is actually three different connectors that look very much alike: DVI-D (digital), DVI-A (analog), and DVI-A/D or DVI-I (interchangeable---it accepts either a DVI-D or DVI-A).

As a legacy standard, DVI appears on fewer and fewer new devices---but DVI-D and DVI-I connectors (which may be single-link or dual-link) can still power low-end displays. Single-link DVI can drive a display with a resolution of 1920 × 1080 at a refresh rate of 60 Hz, and dual-link DVI (see Figure 17-10) can drive a 2048 × 1536 display at 60 Hz. (We'll take a closer look at resolution and refresh rate later in the chapter.)

Figure 17-10  Dual-link DVI-I connector

HDMI  Many monitors, projectors, and VR headsets connect to a computer via the High-Definition Multimedia Interface (HDMI) connector, which carries both video and audio signals (see Figure 17-11). The latest version of HDMI can handle just about any resolution, but keep in mind that an older version may not.

Figure 17-11  HDMI port on a monitor

NOTE   The CompTIA A+ exam objectives don't touch on them, but HDMI technically has more than one type of connector. They aren't common, but don't be shocked if you see an HDMI logo next to an unfamiliar mini or micro port on a compact device such as a digital camera.

DisplayPort, Thunderbolt, and USB Type-C  Using DisplayPort (DP), Thunderbolt, and USB Type-C connections are an increasingly common way to supply video and audio to displays.

EXAM TIP   On the CompTIA 1102 Exam, USB Type-C is referred to as USB-C. They are both used interchangeably and are both trademarks of USB Implementers Forum. To remain consistent with our previous CompTIA A+ publications, we will continue to use the USB Type-C designation wherever mentioned in this chapter.

Each of these is technically its own standard with different capabilities, but I'm lumping them together here for a reason. Full-sized DP connections are common these days, like with my Dell monitors (see Figure 17-12). These connect to full-sized DP ports on display adapters, as you would expect.

Figure 17-12  DisplayPort connection on monitor

Thunderbolt 1 and Thunderbolt 2 adopted the same connector type that's used for the small version of DisplayPort, called Mini DisplayPort (mDP). Thunderbolt 3 and 4, however, use the USB Type-C connector. USB 3 and 4 also both support using the Type-C connector to drive a display without Thunderbolt.

If that isn't confusing enough, buckle up: you'll find monitors that connect mDP-to-mDP without using Thunderbolt 1 or 2, and many USB Type-C connectors and cables lack Thunderbolt 3 or 4 support. If you're lucky, you'll find a little Thunderbolt symbol next to the ports (see Figure 17-13) to distinguish them---but it isn't always present. Your best bet is to consult the manufacturer's documentation!

Figure 17-13  Logos for plain mDP (left), Thunderbolt 2 mDP (center), Thunderbolt 3/4 USB Type-C (right)

HDBaseT  Some projectors use a connection technology called HDBaseT (see Figure 17-14) that enables long-range connectivity for uncompressed HD video and audio over Cat 5a or Cat 6 network cables (we'll talk about network cabling in Chapter 18). This enables you to connect a projector in a conference room via runs of up to 100 meters. HDBaseT isn't on the CompTIA A+ 1101 exam, but you might encounter it in the real world.

Figure 17-14  HDBaseT port on a projector

Adapters  You will most likely find yourself in a situation where you need to connect a display and video source that don't have a connector in common. In such a case, you can use a small adapter device, like the DVI-to-VGA adapter in Figure 17-15. There are tons of these things out there.

Figure 17-15  DVI-to-VGA adapter

Using an adapter is a good solution if you already have a cable for connecting the devices, but if you don't, getting a cable with different end connectors may be more convenient. Figure 17-16 shows a typical DVI-to-HDMI cable.

Figure 17-16  DVI-to-HDMI cable

Adjustments

It's almost always possible to fiddle with a range of display properties to adjust a display's color balance, brightness, contrast, and so on---but the process differs from display to display. All monitors have an On/Off button; additional buttons may enable you to select among multiple inputs, directly control features like brightness, contrast, and volume, or bring up and navigate the onscreen display (OSD) menu (see Figure 17-17).

Figure 17-17  Typical OSD menu controls

Every monitor maker provides a different way to access its OSD menu, but each provides at least two functions: physical screen adjustment (bigger, smaller, move to the left, right, up, down, and others) and image adjustments like brightness, contrast, and color. Make sure the user understands how to adjust these settings.

VESA Mounts

Almost every monitor these days has a standardized bracket option for mounting the monitor on the wall or on a special stand called a VESA mount. Figure 17-18 shows the bracket option on a monitor. Figure 17-19 shows a stand for mounting two monitors side-by-side. VESA mounts vary with size---big televisions need a larger mounting bracket than 24-inch computer monitors.

Figure 17-18  VESA mounting option on monitor

Figure 17-19  Dual-monitor stand that uses VESA mounts

Add-on Features

Some monitor manufacturers add extra features to their products, such as USB hubs, speakers, webcams, and microphones. These are supported by an upstream USB port on the monitor that you connect to a USB port on the computer. On newer devices, both ends usually use Type-C connectors. Figure 17-20 shows USB ports on the side of a monitor---it's a very handy feature!

Figure 17-20  USB ports on monitor

Display Adapters

The video source for most monitors is a computer's display adapter (also called a graphics card or video card). This device handles a number of video-related chores for the computer---though the most fundamental is processing information from the CPU and sending it to the display. The display adapter is a complex set of devices. A graphics processor of some type processes data from the CPU and outputs commands to the display. Like any other processor, the graphics processor needs RAM. The graphics processor needs fast connectivity between it, the CPU, and system RAM. The display adapter must have a connection compatible with the monitor.

Traditionally, and still quite commonly in Windows PCs, the display adapter was an expansion card that plugged into the motherboard (see Figure 17-21). Although many new systems have the display adapter circuitry built into the CPU and motherboard, most techs still call it the video card, so we'll start there. This section looks at five aspects that define a video card: motherboard slot, graphics processor, video memory, integrated GPUs, and connections.

Figure 17-21  Typical video card

Motherboard Slot

Every current discrete video card plugs into the PCIe slot on a motherboard. As mentioned, many CPUs/motherboards have the display adapter built-in. I'll discuss integrated graphics after talking about graphics processors and memory types, at which point the topic will make more sense. For now, let's look at PCIe.

PCIe

The PCI Express (PCIe) interface was developed to replace the older Peripheral Component Interconnect (PCI) and Accelerated Graphics Port (AGP) interfaces. PCIe was a natural fit for video because it is incredibly fast. All PCIe video cards use the PCIe ×16 connector (see Figure 17-22). PCIe replaced AGP as the primary video interface almost overnight.

Figure 17-22  PCIe video card connected in PCIe slot

Graphics Processor

The graphics processor handles the heavy lifting of taking commands from the CPU and translating them into coordinates and color information that the monitor understands and displays. Most techs today refer to the device that processes video as a graphics processing unit (GPU).

Video card discussion, at least among techs, almost always revolves around the graphics processor the video card uses and the amount of RAM onboard. A typical video card might be called an MSI Ventus GeForce GTX 3080 Ti 12-GB 384-bit GDDR6X PCI Express 4.0, so let's break that down. (Product listings vary---you won't always see the elements in exactly the same order.) MSI is the manufacturer of the video card; Ventus is one of a few different MSI product lines; GeForce GTX 3080 Ti is the graphics processor; 12-GB 384-bit GDDR6X describes the dedicated video RAM and the connection between the video RAM and the graphics processor; and PCI Express 4.0 describes the motherboard expansion slot the card requires.

NOTE   Many video cards come with a digital anti-theft technology called High-bandwidth Digital Content Protection (HDCP). HDCP stops audio and video copying between high-speed connections, such as HDMI, DisplayPort, and DVI. The technology also stops playback of HDCP-encrypted content (like Netflix) on devices designed to circumvent the system.

Many companies make the hundreds of different video cards on the market, but only three companies produce the vast majority of graphics processors found on video cards: NVIDIA, AMD, and Intel. NVIDIA and AMD make and sell graphics processors to third-party manufacturers who then design, build, and sell video cards under their own branding. Intel has long focused on building integrated GPUs into its processors, but it returned to the dedicated GPU market in 2021. Figure 17-23 shows an NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3080 Ti on a board made by EVGA.

Figure 17-23  NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3080 Ti

Low-end graphics processors usually work fine for the run-of-the-mill user who wants to write letters or run a Web browser. High-end graphics processors are designed for demanding tasks such as powering high-end displays and rendering beautiful 3-D graphics (whether that's for professionals such as graphic designers, animators, architects, and engineers---or for, you know...games!).

Video Memory

When you're working with demanding graphics applications (such as rendering special effects for a movie or playing a game with high-quality assets), video memory can prove to be a serious bottleneck in three ways: data throughput speed, access speed, and simple capacity. Manufacturers address these bottlenecks by upping the width of the bus between the video RAM and video processor, adding more and more total RAM, and developing special-purpose RAM.

Specialized types of video RAM (VRAM)---namely Graphics DDR (GDDR) and High Bandwidth Memory (HBM)---exist to meet these high speed and bandwidth demands. You'll generally find a recent generation of special-purpose video RAM---such as GDDR6X or HBM3---in the latest high-end graphics cards, but keep in mind that you may run into low-budget graphics cards that use a recent generation of generic DDR RAM.

NOTE   HBM has some big performance and efficiency advantages over GDDR, but it's also a newer, more expensive technology. It has appeared on a few consumer graphics cards, but has had better success in GPUs designed for use in data centers. We'll probably still be buying GDDR-based cards for years, but this could change in a hurry if the price of HBM drops.

Integrated GPUs

Some motherboards support CPUs with integrated GPUs and provide HDMI and/or Display ports along with the usual mix of USB, Ethernet, and other I/O connectors. When a system uses the CPU's internal GPU, we often say it has integrated graphics.

Traditionally, integrated GPUs aren't very powerful---but they are still fairly common in laptops because integrating them saves a lot of space and power. That said, gradual innovation driven by the popularity of mobile devices and laptops is starting to overturn this old assumption.

AMD and NVIDIA both make integrated GPU chips, Intel has long integrated the Intel Graphics Media Accelerator (GMA) into its chipsets, and Apple has recently made a splash with its M1 processor family, which combines a powerful CPU and GPU on the same chip.

The best of these now rival any CPU/discrete graphics card combination that you'd find in a comparable portable computer and are good enough for casual gaming. Even Intel's integrated graphics, which have long been a bit of a joke for anything beyond basic desktop productivity, have made big strides in recent years. NVIDIA's Tegra line is focused on gaming (Nintendo Switch) and automotive entertainment systems.

NOTE   There's a lot going on under the hood of a combined CPU/GPU. A single Apple M1 chip, for example, integrates 8 to 20 CPU cores, 7 to 64 GPU cores, 16 to 32 neural cores, 8 to 128 GB of low-power DDR4 memory, and cache memory. Wow!

Connector Types and Associated Cables

Display adapters have one or more connectors you can use to connect them to a video display---make sure you're familiar with each of the connectors we looked at earlier in the chapter:

-   VGA

-   DVI

-   HDMI

-   DisplayPort

-   Thunderbolt (including mDP Thunderbolt 1 and 2 ports, and USB Type-C Thunderbolt 3 and 4 ports)

-   USB Type-C

You can also find video cards (especially older ones) with a number of connector types for interfacing with other media devices such as cameras, projectors, television sets, and so on. The video card shown in Figure 17-24 has three connectors: VGA, DVI-I, and a once-common S-video connector. In the days before HDMI, an S-video connector like this was a decent way to connect your computer to a standard definition TV.

Figure 17-24  Video card connectors: VGA, S-video, and DVI-I

EXAM TIP   A graphics card isn't the only place you'll find a bunch of video connectors. Capture cards sport one or more video connectors to enable us to record, stream, or watch video from another video source. They may also have an output connector so that you can also pass the signal back to a normal display for simultaneous viewing.

The video card in Figure 17-25, in contrast, offers four connectors: HDMI, DP (×3). And yes, in case you were wondering, the card can drive four 4K monitors simultaneously!

Figure 17-25  Video card connectors: HDMI and DisplayPort

Installing and Configuring Video

As long as you have the right connection to your video card or integrated graphics, installing a monitor is straightforward. Installing the video card itself can be trickier.

NOTE   The installation steps in this section apply to Windows PCs and Linux computers. None of Apple's current macOS systems (except the super expensive Mac Pro) enable you to upgrade the internal display adapter, but you can still configure it or attach an external GPU. (See the Beyond A+ section "eGPUs" for more details.)

During the physical installation of a video card, watch out for three possible issues: long cards, the proximity of the nearest expansion card, and the presence of power connectors. Some high-end video cards simply won't fit in certain cases or will block access to needed motherboard connectors such as the SATA sockets. Unless your case includes a special mounting bracket for mounting the card in a different orientation, there's no clean fix for such a problem---you simply have to change at least one of the components (video card, motherboard, or case).

Because high-end video cards run very hot, you don't want them sitting right next to another card; make sure the fan on the video card has plenty of ventilation space. I leave the slot next to the video card empty to allow better airflow (see Figure 17-26).

Figure 17-26  Installing a video card

More powerful video cards have massive heat sinks and large cooling fans, so you don't have any choice but to take up double or triple the space. Midrange to high-end video cards typically require at least one (or two) additional PCIe power connectors because they use more power than the PCIe slot can provide. Make sure that your power supply can provide adequate power and has the correct type (6- or 8-pin) of PCIe power connectors.

Install a Video Card

You know how to install an expansion card from your reading in earlier chapters. Installing a video card is pretty much the same, so try this!

1\.   Refer to Chapter 6 for the steps on installing a new card and refer to Chapter 7 for a visual on video power connectors.

2\.   Plug the monitor cable into the video card port on the back of the PC and power up the system. If your PC seems dead after you install a video card, or if the screen is blank but you hear fans whirring and the internal speaker sounding off long-short-short-short, your video card likely did not get properly seated. Unplug the PC and try again.

Once you've properly installed the video card and connected it to the monitor, you've fought half the battle for making the video process work properly. You're ready to tackle the drivers and tweak the operating system, so let's go!

Software

Configuring your video software is usually a two-step process. First you need to load drivers for the video card. Then you need to open Display Settings and Personalization Settings. Let's explore how to make the video card and monitor work in Windows, then look briefly at display options in macOS and Linux.

Drivers

Just like any other piece of hardware, a video card needs drivers to function. Display adapter drivers install pretty much the same way as all the other drivers we've discussed thus far: Windows has the driver already; insert the installation media that came with the card; or download the latest driver from the Internet.

Video card makers are constantly updating their drivers. Odds are good that any video card more than a few months old has at least one driver update. If possible, check the manufacturer's Web site and use the driver located there if there is one. If the Web site doesn't offer a driver, it's usually best to use the installation media. Always avoid using the built-in Windows driver as it tends to be the most dated.

We'll explore driver issues in more detail after we discuss the Display Settings and the Personalization Settings. Like so many things about video, you can't fully understand one topic without understanding at least one other!

1102

Using Display and Personalization

With the driver installed, you're ready to configure your display settings. The Display Settings or Personalization Settings provide convenient, central locations for all of your display settings, including resolution, refresh rate, driver information, and color depth.

Display Settings  The Display Settings in Windows enable adjusting most display options. Open Display Settings by clicking Start | Settings | System. Figure 17-27 shows the default initial Display Settings screen (on a dual-monitor system). Each monitor attached to the system gets a number, and you can drag and drop them to change the location. Figure 17-28 shows a different system with two monitors stacked vertically.

Figure 17-27  Display Settings in Windows 11

Figure 17-28  Vertically stacked monitors in Windows 10 Display Settings

NOTE   There are small differences between how these elements look and work in Windows 10 and Windows 11, so I'm going to jump back and forth between them for these screenshots. They both have the same functionality, and it's important as a tech to get used to things moving around between different OS versions.

The two options in Windows 10 under Color are Night light and Color profile. Enabling the Night light setting helps to reduce eye strain for those of us who tend to work or play after dark. You can set it to change the screen automatically during the evening, reducing the blue in the default screen, turning the "white" into a vaguely pale orange color. This isn't on the exam, but it's a helpful feature. Color profile enables you to select a profile---a set of parameters specific to a monitor---to get the precise color on screen that you'll see in print (assuming the print device is calibrated for proper color as well). The Color profile in Figure 17-28 is grayed out because no profiles are installed (in Windows 11 the option will only appear if at least one of your monitors has the capability). Check the Color Management applet in Control Panel to adjust further (see Figure 17-29).

Figure 17-29  Windows 10 Color Management applet in Control Panel

Scrolling down in Display Settings reveals more advanced options (see Figure 17-30). You can change the scale of text, icons, and more with a drop-down menu. This helps with high-resolution monitors and people who need things a little bigger to navigate the screen options. Changing scaling is preferable to changing resolution, because the interface remains at the default (and best) resolution.

In some scenarios, you'll need to adjust the resolution or orientation of the monitor. The Resolution drop-down menu enables you to change the resolution (to match a projector, for example, so the presentation you see on the monitor looks the same as your audience will see). The Orientation drop-down menu enables you to change from the default Landscape mode to Portrait mode if you have a monitor that swivels (see Figure 17-31).

Figure 17-31  Windows 10 showing monitor in portrait mode

The Multiple displays option gives you control over what shows on the second (or more) screen. The default is Extend these displays, which gives you more desktop space for workflow. Figure 17-32 shows my editor working with extended displays configured. You can also duplicate the main display, so the same image shows on all connected monitors, or blank one or the other monitor.

Figure 17-32  My editor hard at work with two monitors

NOTE   You can readily add additional displays to a system. In years past, you would add a second video card to the system and plug the second monitor into it, then go to the Display Settings to extend the displays. Almost all video cards you can buy today have more than one port, often of different types. Get a cable that matches and plug in for better computing.

Click the Advanced display option for specific information about the monitor(s) connected. Figure 17-33 shows the settings for Display 2, an AORUS gaming monitor. Note the screen shows the resolution, refresh rate, and bit depth of the panel (as well as color format and color space, which we'll discuss in Beyond A+).

This screen also enables you to open the general Properties for the display adapter and monitor by clicking Display adapter properties (see Figure 17-34). The Adapter tab shows information about the adapter, such as GPU and RAM. Clicking the Properties button will open a dialog box to update or roll back the driver. See "Working with Drivers" a bit later in this chapter for more information.

Personalization Settings  Personalization-branded tools handle user preferences, such as background picture, colors of various interface elements, and that sort of thing. Figure 17-35 shows the Personalization Settings background screen. The changes you can make are pretty obvious: make your background a solid color or pick a picture; you can use one of the images that come with Windows or choose your own.

The list on the left gives you many more options for tweaking the look and feel of Windows, such as customizing a theme (the overall look and feel), changing the default font, and adjusting the Start menu and Taskbar. The Related Settings at the bottom can help people who have trouble with the default interface, with High contrast settings. The Sync your settings (Windows 10) or Windows backup (Windows 11) option under Accounts enables you to synchronize multiple Windows machines that you log on to with your Microsoft account (see Figure 17-36).

Figure 17-36  Windows 10 Sync your settings options

Display Options in macOS and Linux

macOS and most modern Linux distros offer clear options for changing display settings. To no one's surprise, you'll find the options in macOS in System Preferences (see Figure 17-37). The General settings enable you to change color schemes. You can change the Desktop background in Desktop & Screen Saver.

Figure 17-37  System Preferences in macOS

Click the Dock & Menu Bar option to access a screen that enables you to change the user experience a lot (see Figure 17-38). The Dock resides by default along the bottom of the screen. You can make the icons tiny and less distracting. You can move the Dock to the right or left. You can change the default animation behavior for mouseovers.

Figure 17-38  Dock & Menu Bar options

Different Linux distros put the display options in various places, but you'll commonly find one or more utilities in the System Settings. Figure 17-39 shows the Settings app in Ubuntu, for example, where you can alter most of your system settings, including the background, theme, and Launcher icon size.

Figure 17-39  Changing the system appearance in Ubuntu's Settings app

All the things you can modify in Windows, you can modify in Linux. You just might have to do a little hunting.

Working with Drivers

Now that you know the locations of the primary video tools within the operating system, it's time to learn about fine-tuning your video. You need to know how to work with video drivers from within Settings, including how to update them, roll back updates, and uninstall them.

When you update the drivers for a card, you have a choice of uninstalling the outdated drivers and then installing new drivers---which makes the process the same as for installing a new card---or you can let Windows flex some digital muscle and install the new ones right over the older drivers.

To get to the adapter settings, as you'll recall from earlier, open the Display Settings, click Advanced display, and click the Display adapter properties link to open the Monitor and Adapter Properties dialog box. Click the Properties button on the Adapter tab to open the Adapter Properties dialog box (see Figure 17-40). (Note that the "Adapter" in the dialog box will be the specific video card.) The General tab gives some information about the card, but the Driver tab gets to the heart of things.

Figure 17-40  Adapter Properties dialog box with Driver tab selected

To update drivers, click the Update Driver button. Windows will give you the option of searching for updated drivers on both your computer and the Internet or just on your computer (see Figure 17-41). The former option these days is pretty magical, as long as the computer is connected to the Internet, of course.

Troubleshooting Video

Users might temporarily ignore a bad printer or other device, but will holler like crazy when the screen doesn't look the way they expect. Some video problems always point to a specific component, but others have more than one potential cause. To fix the latter kind of video problems quickly, a good place to start is by isolating where, between the computer and the display, the problem lies.

When you run into common problems that could easily be caused by settings built into a monitor, give them a quick check first. If a display turns on but doesn't show anything (or shows the incorrect data/video source), flip through video sources (you might need to do this through an on-screen menu, a physical button, or a remote). If the image is a little bright, dark, washed-out, or has incorrect color display issues such as a consistent tint, double-check the image adjustment settings.

The process is similar when audio issues are the only problem---usually that the audio isn't working at all or is coming through the wrong device. Start by making sure the expected output device isn't muted and that the volume is at an appropriate level. If that's fine, check the device's audio/sound output settings to make sure the correct output device is selected. The location differs by OS, but each has an option to test a specific output device by playing a tone. If you don't see the correct output, ensure the devices are cabled correctly and that they all support audio. Keep in mind that VGA and DVI cables won't carry sound, and some displays have no speakers.

For rare, obvious visual problems such as a flashing screen, streaking, smearing, missing colors, and strange visual distortions, check the cable and connections for physical cabling issues first. Confirm the connectors are seated properly. Try another cable. If another cable works, replace the bad cable. If another cable doesn't work, double-check the ports on both ends for any debris or damage. If the cable is particularly long, it's also worth trying a shorter cable just in case you're getting bit by signal loss.

Connect the display to another system. If the cable isn't the culprit and the display works fine on another system, suspect the video card (see the upcoming "Troubleshooting Video Cards and Drivers" section). If the display's problem persists on another system, see the "Troubleshooting Monitors" section (and also the "Troubleshooting Projectors" section, if appropriate).

Troubleshooting Monitors

This section assumes you'll leave display repair to trained professionals and concentrates instead on giving a support person the information necessary to fix basic problems and decide whether a trouble ticket is warranted.

Common Display Problems

I don't recommend opening a monitor to work on it unless you've been trained how to do it safely, but you can still fix many display problems yourself. The following list describes the most common monitor problems and tells you what to do---even when that means sending it to someone else.

-   As displays age, they lose brightness. If the brightness control is turned all the way up and the picture seems dim, you'll have to replace the backlight, display, or the entire device. This is a good argument for using the power switch or OS power-management options to turn off displays whenever your systems are idle.

-   A display panel may have bad pixels. A bad pixel is any single pixel that does not react the way it should. A pixel that never lights up is a dead pixel, a pixel that is stuck on pure white is a lit pixel, and a pixel that is always some other specific color is a stuck pixel. If you discover bad pixels on a monitor under warranty, the best course of action is to contact the manufacturer. (Fair warning: The warranty of every panel manufacture requires a certain number of bad pixels to be present for the warranty to cover replacement even on a brand-new monitor! You need to check the warranty for your monitor and see how many bad pixels must be present before you may return it.) If the monitor isn't under warranty, you can try to revive the pixel using techniques discussed online, learn to live with the bad pixels, or replace the monitor.

-   If a display panel cracks, it is not repairable and must be replaced.

-   A flickering image usually points to a problem with the backlight or internal circuits. The exact fix will depend on the technologies in use---but you'll probably have to replace the backlight, display panel, or the whole monitor.

-   A dim image, especially on only the top or bottom half of the screen, points to a dead or dying backlight.

-   If the LCD goes dark but you can still barely see the image under bright lights, you lost either the backlight or the inverter. In many cases, especially with super-thin panels, you'll replace the entire panel and backlight as a unit.

-   If an older LCD with a CCFL backlight makes a distinct hissing noise, an inverter is about to fail. You can replace the inverter, but at this point I recommend replacing the display.

-   If an image displayed for a long time (common with interface elements in operating systems and games) leaves a shadow or impression, you're seeing image persistence. Most persistence problems these days are temporary and should go away if you turn the display off for at least as long as it was on. If not, it may be permanent display burn-in. Early generations of each new display technology tend to struggle with burn-in, so it's a good idea to protect them with time-tested solutions: configure the OS to turn off idle displays or protect them with an animated screen saver. Monitors particularly prone to burn-in (such as OLEDs) may also have menu options that help minimize the likelihood or appearance of burn-in. If the burn-in doesn't go away and you can't live with it, you'll have to replace the display.

Bottom line on fixing displays? You can find companies that sell replacement parts, but repairing displays is difficult, and there are folks who will do it for you faster and cheaper than you can. Search for a specialty display repair company. Hundreds of these companies exist all over the world.

Dealing with High-Resolution Monitors

High-resolution monitors offer beautiful visuals, but can make screen elements---buttons, menus, stuff for navigating operating systems and applications---too small for some viewers. If you recall from earlier in the chapter, display panels have a default resolution; the picture will degrade (and may look a little fuzzy) if you set the resolution lower than the default. But that's what a lot of people do, because it makes the screen elements bigger and thus useable. That's not the solution!

The best way to deal with the scenario of tiny screen elements is through the Display Settings. Every version of Windows enables you to change the size of screen elements directly, making the screen elements appear larger (or smaller). The resolution doesn't change; only the size of the screen elements change. Figure 17-42 shows the drop-down menu options in Windows 11. Note that changing the size of text, apps, and other items from 100 percent to 125 or 150 percent is a simple selection.

Figure 17-42  Changing the size of text, apps, and other items in Windows 11

Try This!

Scaling the UI

Most of you have access to a Windows computer, so try this! Open Display Settings and experiment with the element size settings. This is something you absolutely need to understand to help users with high-resolution monitors.

Cleaning Monitors

Cleaning monitors isn't like scrubbing a sink or even cleaning a window---you can't just pick whatever cleaning solution and rag are lying around and go to town. Even when a display is protected by a layer of glass, it's still likely to have delicate coatings that reduce glare and resist grime.

Before you dive in, consult your display's manual or other documentation for any special precautions, recommendations, or equipment. Here's what I recommend---as long as your display's documentation doesn't disagree!

-   Do not directly spray any liquid onto the screen. If it runs and leaks into any electronics, you could hurt yourself and fry the display.

-   Don't use any cleaners or solvents. Multiple display manufacturers explicitly caution against all of them---even common electronics cleaners such as alcohol.

-   Don't use prepackaged disposable wipes marketed for cleaning things like lenses or electronics. Some of the ones made specifically for cleaning monitors might be fine, but it isn't always easy to figure out what's in them---and many of them contain alcohol.

-   Start with a clean, dry microfiber cloth and gently wipe dirt and grime off the display. Don't push hard, scrape, or scrub---remember the delicate coatings!

-   If the screen still has grime on it, apply just enough water to dampen part of the microfiber cloth and continue to gently wipe the screen. This can be frustrating, but it's better to be patient and persistent than to damage an expensive display with force! Promptly dry the screen with the dry portion of your cloth.

Privacy with Multiple Monitors

Adding a second or third monitor to your setup can have a couple of downsides. The added viewing area can increase the potential for glare or reflection from other objects, making optimal monitor placement difficult. The extra visual real estate and viewing angles also make it easy for even casual passersby to see what you're viewing.

Monitor peripheral vendors address these problems with privacy screens. The screens fit over and slightly around the display. They stop wide-angle viewing of the screen and also drop the glare caused by external object reflection.

Multiple Monitor Mishaps

Video cards can handle multiple monitors that differ from one another in size or resolution, but this can create problems. Connecting an older 4:3 aspect ratio projector to a widescreen laptop for a presentation when you're mirroring the displays, for example, can create a pretty bizarre misalignment in layout. Using monitors with different orientation---landscape and portrait---can also produce undesirable effects. Try variations before your presentations!

Also, Windows enables you to designate which monitor is right or left or top or bottom. Making an alignment error here can cause problems when extending a display. You might drag the cursor to the right side of the left monitor, for example, and hit a wall because the "right" monitor is supposed to be on the left. These kinds of issues require a trip to the Display Settings.

Troubleshooting Projectors

Many of the concepts for troubleshooting traditional monitors also apply when you need to troubleshoot a projector, but there are also a few special points to keep in mind.

-   Projector lamps can produce a lot of heat. If your projector has a lamp, let it cool off before you work on it. After you turn it off, the fan will run for a while to cool the lamp. If that isn't an option, be very careful where you touch to avoid burning yourself.

-   Projector lamps have a relatively short life (usually a few thousand hours) compared to most other display components. They're expensive, but otherwise simple to replace. Keep a spare lamp on hand; not only will you be ready to save the day when one burns out before a big executive meeting, but a spare lamp will help you rule out lamp issues when troubleshooting a projector. You might (depending on the device) be able to do the same with LED or laser light engines (though you won't need to replace them nearly as often).

-   Speaking of replacement parts, keep some spare batteries around for the remote. Most projectors are mounted in a hard-to-reach location. If the projector won't respond, try swapping out the remote's batteries before you break out a ladder to reach the projector's physical buttons.

-   Projectors have a fan to cool off the lamp. If the fan goes out or the filter gets clogged, the lamp could overheat. The screen may suddenly go black if it goes into an overheat shutdown. If users haven't figured out that this is heat-related, they might describe random, occasional, or intermittent projector shutdowns. Trying to turn the projector immediately back on to troubleshoot the issue may not work at all. If it does, it certainly won't help the main problem. Clean dust out of the fans, filters, and vents---and confirm that the fan is working.

-   Like any display that goes unused for long enough, a projector might go into sleep mode. It'll usually wake up if you use the computer or press the right button on the remote. If the projector is clearly running but there's no image on the screen, you may have to reboot it.

-   If you notice incorrect color display issues such as a strong tint that aren't fixed by color adjustments or replacing the cables, an LCD or DLP component has failed and the projector will need service or replacement.

-   If the projector throws a fuzzy image, the lens might be dirty or out of focus (if its focus is adjustable), or the projector may not be at the intended distance from the screen. Check for dust and dirt, try adjusting the focus, and consult the documentation to ensure it's at the right distance from the screen.

Above all else, don't get too focused on the fact that you're dealing with a projector when you have to troubleshoot one. It's easy to jump straight to projector-specific solutions and miss simple problems like a poorly connected cable, or a laptop that isn't configured to extend or mirror its display to the projector.

Troubleshooting Video Cards and Drivers

Video cards rarely go bad, so the majority of video card and driver problems are bad or incompatible drivers or incorrect settings. Always make sure you have the correct driver installed. If you're using an incompatible driver, you might get a Blue Screen of Death (BSoD) as soon as Windows starts to load. A system with a suddenly corrupted driver usually doesn't act up until the next reboot. If you reboot a system with a corrupted driver, Windows will do one of the following: default into a lower resolution, blank the monitor, lock up, or display a garbled screen with weird patterns, incorrect color patterns, or a distorted image.

Whatever the output, reboot into Safe mode and roll back or delete the driver. The drivers may manifest as installed programs under Apps and Features, so check there first before you try deleting a driver via Device Manager. Download the latest driver and reinstall.

Video cards are pretty durable, but they have two components that do go bad: the fan and the RAM. Lucky for you, if either of these goes out, it tends to show the same error---bizarre screen outputs followed shortly by a screen lockup. Usually Windows keeps running; you may see your mouse pointer moving around and windows refreshing, but the screen turns into a huge mess (see Figure 17-43).

Figure 17-43  Serious video problem

Bad drivers sometimes also make this error, so always first try going into Safe mode to see if the problem suddenly clears up. If it does, you do not have a problem with the video card!

Excessive heat inside the case, even with the video card fan running at full blast, can create some interesting effects. The computer could simply shut down due to overheating. You'll recognize this possible cause because the computer will come back up in a minute or two, but then shut down again as you push it hard enough to heat it up again. Sometimes the screen will show bizarre artifacts or start distorting. Check your case fans and make sure nothing is too close to the video card. You might need to take the whole system outside to blow dust out of its filters, vents, fans, and heatsinks.

Beyond A+

Evaluating Monitors

The CompTIA A+ exam no longer addresses the technical properties that you'll need to know to help your customers find the right monitor for their needs. The popularity of portable and mobile devices with built-in displays has made this skill a little less important over the years, but I still think any tech that supports desktop users---or even laptop users that need a second or third screen---need to know this stuff! Let's look at the most important properties.

Resolution

A resolution, such as 2560 × 1440, describes the number of pixels on a display (in this case, 2560 pixels across and 1440 pixels down). Displays are designed to run at a single native resolution. You can't run a display at a resolution higher than the native resolution, and running it at a lower than native resolution degrades the image quality. The display has to use an edge-blurring technique called interpolation to soften the jagged corners of the pixels when running at lower than native resolution, which simply does not look as good. The bottom line? Always set the display at native resolution!

NOTE   Two display panels that have the same physical size may have different native resolutions.

The number of pixels arranged on the screen define the aspect ratio of the picture, such as 16:9 or 21:9 (see Figure 17-44). A typical widescreen monitor running at 1920 × 1080 is an example of 16:9 aspect ratio. An ultrawide monitor running at 3440 × 1440 is an example of 21:9. You can change the aspect ratio of many monitors in the operating system tools, such as Display in Windows, but the quality of picture will degrade.

Figure 17-44  Various aspect ratios compared

Modern computing devices use different aspect ratios. Many smartphones stick to 16:9, but a lot of newer Android and iPhone models have gone wider with aspect ratios like 18:9 and 19.5:9. Most Apple iPads, in contrast, have a 4:3 aspect ratio screen; the Microsoft Surface laptop uses a 3:2 screen.

Monitor marketing has always been a mess, but display manufacturers usually mention at least the physical size of the display. They often go on to indicate the panel technology, resolution, aspect ratio, and maybe one or two of its most important features.

Once upon a time, a display's native resolution was usually indicated by the name (technically an initialism) of the corresponding video mode---such as the ancient VGA (640 × 480) and SVGA (800 × 600) formats. These days, displays are usually marketed with some combination of shorthand borrowed from TV (such as HD, 1080p, FHD, UHD) or film (2K, 4K, 8K, and so on). These formats are easier to remember (mostly because there aren't as many), but it's good to know that these designations (especially the film-style ones) are applied to multiple similar resolutions.

Memorizing every possible resolution isn't a good use of your time (there are a ton of resolutions out there), but it is a good idea to be able to recognize the patterns in case you see them in the real world. Table 17-1 shows a mix of these terms and corresponding properties.

Table 17-1  Display Resolution Shorthand

PPI

The combination of the resolution and physical size of a display determines the pixels per inch (PPI) of a panel. The higher the PPI, the finer the picture a monitor can produce. That means, in practical terms, that a smaller high-resolution monitor will look substantially better than a much larger monitor running at the same resolution. A 24-inch 1080p monitor, for example, looks good at just under 100 PPI. A 32-inch 1080p monitor looks kind of grainy, because its PPI is sub-70. This PPI number is part of what makes a MacBook Pro laptop so crisp. The 15.4-inch screen has a resolution of 2880 × 1800, which puts it at 220 pixels per inch. That's sweet! Modern smartphones have outrageous PPI levels, which again is why they look so much better than a typical desktop monitor.

Brightness

The strength of any display's light-emitting components (the backlight, for an LCD, or the LEDs themselves in an OLED display) determine the brightness of the monitor. The brightness is measured in nits. Display panels vary from 100 nits on the low end to over 1000 nits or more on the high end. Average displays are around 300 nits, which most monitor authorities consider excellent brightness. Higher brightness levels also make it easier to view displays in bright rooms.

NOTE   One nit equals one candela/m2. One candela is roughly equal to the amount of light created by a candle.

Viewing Angle

Flat-panel displays have a limited viewing angle, meaning the screen fades out when viewed from the side (or any angle not dead center). Note the viewing angle when shopping for a monitor. Wider is better for typical users. Narrow isn't necessarily bad---especially when you want to limit what anyone but the user can see on the monitor.

Try This!

Test the Viewing Angle

Take a trip to your local computer store to look at displays. Don't get distracted looking at all the latest graphics cards, CPUs, motherboards, and RAM---well, actually, it's okay to look at those things. Just don't forget to look at monitors!

Stand about two feet in front of a display. Look directly at the image on the screen and consider the image quality, screen brightness, and color. Take a small step to your right. Compare the image you see now to the image you saw previously. Continue taking small steps to the right until you are no longer able to discern the image on the display. You've reached the edge of the viewing angle for that panel.

Do this test with a few different monitors. Do smaller panels, such as 20-inch displays, have smaller viewing angles? Do larger displays have better viewing angles? You might also want to test the vertical viewing angles of some monitors. Try to find a monitor that is on your eye level; then look at it from above or below---does it have a large viewing range vertically? There's also a curved monitor variant not discussed in this chapter, but worth looking at. What kind of viewing angle do they have?

Response Rate

A display's response rate is the amount of time it takes for all of the sub-pixels on the panel to change from one state to another. Manufacturers measure these response rates in milliseconds (ms), with lower being better. There are a few ways manufacturers measure this change. One is black-to-white (BtW): how long it takes the pixels to go from pure black to pure white and back again. The most common is gray-to-gray (GtG): how long it takes the pixels to go from one gray state to another.

NOTE   Manufacturers of gaming-oriented displays may also use moving-picture response time (MPRT): the minimum time a pixel stays lit once activated. If you're looking for a gaming monitor, look for an MPRT closer to 1 ms. If you aren't going to use the display for gaming, treat MPRTs as a sign you may be about to overpay for features you won't be using.

The GtG time will always be faster than the BtW time. A typical modern display has an advertised response rate of less than 5 ms. The manufacturer will almost always advertise the GtG response time, though some publish more than one measure. You might find older displays in use with response times over 20 ms---slow enough that you might notice image smearing if you try to watch a movie or play a fast-paced game.

Refresh Rate

The refresh rate for a display refers to how often a screen can change or update completely. Think of the refresh rate as a metronome or timer and you'll be close to how it works in a display. For most computing purposes, 60 Hz is fine and that's been the standard for the industry. Higher refresh rates smooth out movement and reduce lag, which is most important in fast-moving games. Common higher-end monitors today, though, go well beyond, offering refresh rates like 144 Hz, 165 Hz, 240 Hz, and so on.

NOTE   Higher-end video cards can push well beyond the limits of even the best monitor refresh rates. See the "Adaptive Sync" section later in this Beyond A+ material for the scoop.

Contrast Ratio

A good contrast ratio---the difference between the darkest and lightest spots that the monitor can display---is 450:1, although a quick trip to a computer store will reveal displays with lower levels (250:1) and higher levels (1000:1).

Display manufacturers market a dynamic contrast ratio number for their monitors, which measures the difference between a full-on, all-white screen, and a full-off, all-black screen. This yields a much higher number than the standard contrast ratio. My Samsung panels have a 1000:1 contrast ratio, for example, but a 20,000:1 dynamic contrast ratio. Sounds awesome, right? In general, the dynamic contrast ratio doesn't affect viewing on computer monitors. Focus on the standard contrast ratio when picking displays.

Color Depth

The typical human eye can see an astonishing variety of colors, luminance (aka brightness), and contrast. Scientists interested in what people see have defined this visual variety into graphs known technically as chromaticity diagrams or, more commonly, color spaces (see Figure 17-45).

Figure 17-45  Example of a chromaticity diagram

Computers only display a fraction of what people can see and thus use more limited color spaces. Matching color spaces among devices provides some consistency in color output. Several standards define the color space for the IT industry, though sRGB has long been the standard for displays. The color depth of a display panel indicates how precisely it can replicate colors within the color space it can display.

Very old TN monitors, for example, used a 6-bit panel. That meant that each color channel---red, green, and blue---had 64 (26) color variations. Most monitors today use an 8-bit panel, with 256 (28) colors per channel. This translates in marketing as 24-bit color, meaning the monitor can display 16.7 million color variations. At the higher end, manufacturers have 10-bit panels that display 1024 (210) color variations per channel, providing over 1 billion color variations. High levels of precision are especially important if you do a lot of photo editing or video color grading.

Panel Technology

At this point, the vast majority of users will go with an IPS panel with an edge-lit backlight. You'll have amazing color and viewing angle. Size and resolution will be determined by your budget and space considerations.

Once you move beyond the average user, though, things get tricky. Because the exact panel technologies in a given display can have a big impact on its resolution, brightness, contrast, color fidelity, and price, you'll have to spend some time understanding the user's needs and squaring them with the budget. If your budget isn't tight, a full LED backlight or Mini LED backlight can improve the color quality, brightness, and contrast.

NOTE   If you're an excited early adopter, it's worth considering an OLED display (and microLED, if they're available)---but I don't like recommending new computer display technologies until early adopters have beaten them up for a few years and we understand the tradeoffs.

High Dynamic Range

Have you watched the sun rise or set, with the phenomenal difference in brightness between the vibrant sunlit clouds and deep shadows around the trees? That vista encompasses---from its darkest points to its brightest---a very broad dynamic range. The world around us has a very broad (or high dynamic) range, but photographers and filmmakers have to take special steps to capture enough visual information to get anywhere close.

The standard 8-bit panel uses standard dynamic range (SDR), and that's good enough for almost every computing need, from movies to games to productivity applications. To accurately render high dynamic range (HDR) content, displays need to be very bright---at least 400 nits for OLEDs and 600 nits for LCDs---plus support special HDR image formats. The rich details and sparkling highlights make HDR photographs and videos more lifelike---almost like looking out a window!

NOTE   I'd love to show you a comparison between SDR and HDR, but it's impossible in print. Go to your local computer store and ask for a demo.

Adaptive Sync

When a graphics card is working hard, the number of frames it can generate in any given second fluctuates wildly. When the display and graphics card are out of sync, different parts of the screen may show different frames. This jarring effect is called tearing, and the people who make graphics cards and displays have been working on this problem for years.

An early approach to this problem, vertical sync (V-sync), avoids tearing by using a fixed refresh cycle---at the expense of higher latency. Adaptive sync addressed this tradeoff by enabling a display to synchronize its refresh rate with the graphics card's refresh rate. NVIDIA developed proprietary adaptive sync technology it calls G-Sync, and in response, AMD developed a royalty-free adaptive sync technology called FreeSync. Both technologies are entering their second generations with HDR support: FreeSync Premium Pro and G-Sync Ultimate.

NOTE   Dynamic refresh rates have other applications as well. Some portable devices, for example, may lower the refresh rate to save power when there isn't much animation to render.

These technologies are a big improvement for gaming, but there's a downside: minimal cross-compatibility. To take advantage of adaptive sync, your graphics card and monitor either both need to support FreeSync or both need to support G-Sync (although NVIDIA has very recently announced support for a handful of FreeSync monitors via their G-Sync Compatible program). If you want adaptive sync, research the compatibility of your components carefully!

Additional Display Topics

Display technologies play such a huge role in modern computing that it's hard to believe people used computers for years without anything like a modern display. The rapid growth and development of computing technology is nowhere more visible than in the ever-growing selection of super-thin, curved, astonishingly clear, ultra-wide, blazing-fast, efficient, jaw-droppingly huge displays.

The pace of change in display technologies is so fast that it's hard to keep up, but some of these new bells and whistles cost an arm and a leg. A good tech needs to keep up with these developments in order to pick out displays with features that are meaningful to their users, and avoid blowing the budget on features they could live without. With that in mind, let's look at a few additional display topics that you won't find on this edition of the exam, but you're bound to run into in the real world: microLED displays and external GPUs.

MicroLED

Starting in the early 2010s, microLED (µLED) displays, which form pixels using groups of microscopic LEDs, have been looming on the horizon. This display technology threatens to outperform both LCD and OLED panels on key qualities like energy efficiency, brightness, contrast, response time, and durability. There's no definite timeline, but several companies have hundreds of engineers working on microLED technology, including heavyweights such as Sony, Samsung, and Apple. It's already mature enough to show up in niche real-world uses such as (projector-less!) movie theater screens and large video walls---but not yet in mass-produced display panels.

eGPUs

Manufacturers have taken advantage of the blistering throughput of the latest USB and Thunderbolt busses to create external graphics processing units (eGPUs), standalone boxes with video cards for video processing and gaming. eGPUs enable you to edit 4K on the go and then play graphics-intensive games on portable computers, such as ultrabooks and MacBook Pros. The portables stay thin and light, unlike dedicated gaming portables. Plus, if you want to edit or game but need an ultra-portable computer, you don't need to shell out for a dedicated video production or gaming machine in addition.

You'll find two main types of eGPUs: those that include a GPU, and empty enclosures you can install your own GPU in. Recent versions of the Gigabyte AORUS Gaming Box wrap a high-end Gigabyte-branded NVIDIA gaming card in an enclosure that includes a power supply, water cooling, and several ports for video and peripherals. It has HDMI and DP ports for video, USB ports for key peripherals like a mouse and keyboard, an Ethernet port for wired network access, and a Thunderbolt port for connecting to your computer. This lone Thunderbolt port is powerful enough to supply all of these to a laptop---and even charge it!

Empty enclosures have a similar set of features, but you'll have to do a little research to ensure that your card(s) and enclosure are compatible.

CHAPTER 18

Essentials of Networking

In this chapter, you will learn how to

-   Describe the basic roles of various networked computers

-   Discuss network technologies and Ethernet

-   Describe a typical Ethernet implementation

It's hard to find a computer that's not connected to a network. Whether you're talking about a workstation that's part of a large enterprise network or discussing that smartphone in your pocket, every computer has some form of network connection. CompTIA includes a lot of networking coverage in the CompTIA A+ exams.

This chapter dives into networks in detail, especially the underlying hardware and technologies that make up the bulk of networks in today's homes and businesses. The discussion starts by examining the roles computers play in networking, helping you associate specific names with devices and services you've undoubtedly used many times already. The second portion, and the heart of the chapter, focuses on the now-standard network technology used in most networks, regardless of operating system. The final section examines how this network technology looks in a normal workplace.

1101

Roles Hosts Play in Networks

Take a moment to think about what you do on a network. Most of us, when asked, would say, "surf the Internet," or "watch YouTube videos," or maybe "print to the printer downstairs." These are all good reasons to use a network, but what ties them together? In each of these situations, you use your computer (the local host) to access "stuff" stored on a remote host (not your local computer). A host is any computing device connected to a network. So what do remote computers have that you might want (see Figure 18-1)?

Figure 18-1  Accessing remote computers

NOTE   Terminology shifts as soon as computing devices network together. Because a computing device can take many forms, not just a PC or workstation, we need a term to define networked devices. A host is any computing device connected to a network. A local host, therefore, refers to what's in front of you, like your macOS workstation. A remote host refers to some other computing device on the network or reachable beyond the network (more on those later).

Each networked host fulfills a certain role. A remote computer called a Web server stores the files that make up a Web site. The Web server uses server programs to store and share the data. So the role of the Web server is to provide access to Web sites. Two popular Web server programs are Apache HTTP Server and Microsoft Internet Information Services (IIS). When you access a Web site, your Web browser (likely Mozilla Firefox, Google Chrome, Safari, or Microsoft Edge) asks the Web server to share the Web page files and then displays them (see Figure 18-2). Because your computer asks for the Web page, we call it the client. That's the role of the local host in this example. The remote computer that serves the Web site is a server.

Figure 18-2  Accessing a Web page

NOTE   Any computer that's running a sharing program is by definition a server.

But what about YouTube? YouTube also uses Web servers, but these Web servers connect to massive video databases. Like a normal Web server, these remote computers share the videos with your client device, but they use special software capable of sending video fast enough that you can watch it without waiting (see Figure 18-3).

Figure 18-3  Accessing a YouTube page

But we don't need the Internet to share stuff. Figure 18-4 shows a small home network with each computer running Windows. One of the computers on the network has a printer connected via a USB port. This computer has enabled a printer-sharing program built into Windows so that the other computers on the network can use the printer. That computer, therefore, takes on the role of a print server.

Figure 18-4  Sharing a printer in Windows

No matter how big the network, we use networks to share and access stuff. This stuff might be Web pages, videos, printers, folders, e-mail messages, music . . . what you can share and access is limited only by your ability to find a server program capable of sharing it and a client program that can access it.

Each type of server gets a label that defines its role. A networked host that enables you to access a bunch of files and folders is called a file server, or fileshare. The networked host you use to access e-mail messages? It's called a mail server. Truth in advertising!

NOTE   Along with common modern servers, you'll find a lot of legacy and embedded systems performing very specific, non-modern tasks. A factory producing a widget, for example, might use a proprietary controller that works over a network. Even though technically obsolete, that network unit isn't broken, so why replace it?

Network people call anything that one computer might share with another a resource. The goal of networking, therefore, is to connect computers so that they can share resources or access other shared resources.

To share and access resources, a network must have the following:

1\.   Something that defines and standardizes the design and operation of cabling, network cards, and the interconnection of multiple computers

2\.   An addressing method that enables clients to find servers and enables servers to send data to clients, no matter the size of the network

3\.   Some method of sharing resources and accessing those shared resources

Let's look now at the first of these network needs and discuss current industry standards.

Networking Technologies

When the first network designers sat down at a café to figure out how to get two or more computers to share data and peripherals, they had to write a lot of notes on little white napkins to answer even the most basic questions. The first question was: How? It's easy to say, "Well, just run a wire between them!" But that doesn't tell us how the wire works or how the computers connect to the wire. Here are some more big-picture questions:

-   How will each computer be identified?

-   If two or more computers want to talk at the same time, how do you ensure that all conversations are understood?

-   What kind of wire? What gauge? How many wires in the cable? Which wires do what? How long can the cable be? What type of connectors?

Clearly, making a modern network entails a lot more than just stringing up some cable! As you saw a bit earlier, most networks have one or more client machines, devices that request information or services, and a server, the machine that hosts and shares the data. Both clients and servers need network interface controllers (NICs) that define or label the machine on the network. A NIC also breaks files into smaller data units to send across the network and reassembles the units it receives into whole files. You also need some medium for delivering the data units between two or more devices---most often this is a wire that can carry electrical pulses; sometimes it's radio waves or other wireless methods. Finally, a computer's operating system has to be able to communicate with its own networking hardware and with other machines on the network. Figure 18-5 shows a typical network layout.

Figure 18-5  A typical network

EXAM TIP   Not too many years ago, every NIC came on an expansion card that you added to a motherboard. Most techs called that card a network interface card or NIC. Now that every motherboard has the networking feature built in, the acronym has shifted to network interface controller. You're likely to only see the term NIC on the exams, although the objectives this go-around call them network interface cards.

Frames and NICs

Data is moved from one device to another in discrete chunks called frames. NICs create and process frames.

NOTE   You'll sometimes hear the word packet used instead of frames---this is incorrect. Packets are included within a frame. You'll find more information about packets in Chapter 19.

Every NIC in the world has a built-in identifier, an address unique to that network card, called a media access control (MAC) address. A MAC address is a binary number, meaning it's a string of ones and zeros. Each one or zero is called a bit.

The MAC address is 48 bits long, providing more than 281 trillion MAC addresses, so there are plenty of MAC addresses to go around. Because people have trouble keeping track of that many ones and zeros, we need another way to display the addresses. Hexadecimal is shorthand for representing strings of ones and zeros. One hex character is used to represent four binary characters. Here's the key:

0000 = 0

0001 = 1

0010 = 2

0011 = 3

0100 = 4

0101 = 5

0110 = 6

0111 = 7

1000 = 8

1001 = 9

1010 = A

1011 = B

1100 = C

1101 = D

1110 = E

1111 = F

So, MAC addresses may be binary, but we represent them by using 12 hexadecimal characters. These MAC addresses are burned into every NIC, and some NIC makers print the MAC address on the card. Figure 18-6 shows the System Information utility description of a NIC, with the MAC address highlighted.

Figure 18-6  MAC address

NOTE   Even though MAC addresses are embedded into the NIC, some NICs allow you to change the MAC address on the NIC.

Hey! I thought we were talking about frames! Well, we are, but you need to understand MAC addresses to understand frames.

The many varieties of frames share common features (see Figure 18-7). First, frames contain the MAC address of the network card to which the data is being sent. Second, they have the MAC address of the network card that sent the data. Third is the data itself (at this point, we have no idea what the data is---certain software handles that question), which can vary in size depending on the type of frame. Finally, the frame must contain some type of data check to verify that the data was received in good order. Most frames use a clever mathematical algorithm called a cyclic redundancy check (CRC).

Figure 18-7  Generic frame

MAC Address Search

Every personal computing device has a MAC address assigned to each network connection type it offers. Any number of troubleshooting scenarios will have you scrambling to find a device's MAC address, so try this!

You have many ways to discover the MAC address(es) in Windows, macOS, and Linux. The simplest is through the command-line interface. Here's a method in Windows. At the prompt, type ipconfig /all and press ENTER. You'll find the MAC address listed as the "Physical Address" under the Ethernet adapter Local Area Connection category.

Which command do you think would work at the Terminal in macOS and Linux? How do you figure out which switch to use? (Refresh your memory of commands in Chapter 15.)

This discussion of frames raises a question: How big is a frame? Or more specifically, how much data do you put into each frame? How do you ensure that the receiving system understands the way the data was broken down by the sending machine and can thus put the pieces back together? The hard part of answering these questions is that they encompass so many items. When the first networks were created, everything from the frames to the connectors to the type of cable had to be invented from scratch.

To make a successful network, you need the sending and receiving devices to use the same network technology. Over the years, many hardware protocols came and went, but today only one hardware protocol dominates the modern computing landscape: Ethernet. Ethernet was developed for wired networking, but even wireless networks use Ethernet as the basis for their signals. If you want to understanding networking, you need to understand Ethernet.

Ethernet

A consortium of companies, including Digital Equipment Corporation, Intel, and Xerox, invented the first network in the mid-1970s. More than just create a network, they wrote a series of standards that defined everything necessary to get data from one computer to another. This series of standards was called Ethernet. Over the years, Ethernet has gone through hundreds of distinct improvements in areas such as speed, signaling, and cabling. We call these improvements Ethernet flavors.

Through all the improvements in Ethernet, the Ethernet frame hasn't changed in over 25 years. This is very important: you can have any combination of hardware devices and cabling using different Ethernet flavors on a single Ethernet network and, in most cases, the hosts will be able to communicate just fine.

Most modern Ethernet networks employ one of two speeds, 1000BASE-T or 10GBASE-T, which were preceded by 10BASE-T and 100BASE-TX. As the numbers in the names suggest, 10BASE-T networks run at 10 Mbps, 100BASE-TX networks (called Fast Ethernet) run at 100 Mbps, 1000BASE-T networks (called Gigabit Ethernet) run at 1000 Mbps, or 1 Gbps, and 10GBASE-T runs at speeds of up to 10 Gbps. All four technologies---collectively referred to as just plain Ethernet---use a star bus topology (discussed in the next section) and connect via a type of cable called unshielded twisted pair (UTP).

NOTE   Ethernet developers continue to refine the technology. Fast Ethernet (100BASE-TX) is still out there on many older devices. Gigabit Ethernet (1000BASE-T) might be the most common desktop standard now, but 2.5-, 5-, and 10-Gigabit Ethernet (10GBASE-T) are becoming more common for desktop power users. 50/100-Gigabit Ethernet is out in datacenter environments as well.

The Ethernet Star Bus

With all Ethernet networks, every individual host connects to a central box. You attach each system to this box via cables to special ports. The box takes care of all the tedious details required by the network to get frames sent to the correct systems. This layout, which looks something like a star, is called a star bus topology (see Figure 18-8). (The bus refers to the internal wiring in the box. The star refers to the wires leading from the box to the hosts.)

Figure 18-8  Ethernet star bus

NOTE   The term topology refers to the physical or logical layout of the network connections---that is, how everything connects. A star bus topology combines two traditional ways to make a network and thus gets another name: a hybrid topology.

The central box---the switch---provides a common point of connection for network devices. Switches can have a wide variety of ports. Most consumer-level switches have 4 or 8 ports, but business-level switches can have 32 or more ports.

Early Ethernet networks used a hub. A switch is a far superior version of a hub and replaced hubs in the 2000s. (Why CompTIA continues to include hubs in the CompTIA A+ objectives is a mystery.) Figure 18-9 shows a typical consumer-level switch.

Figure 18-9  A switch

Hubs and switches look pretty much identical and they perform the same basic job: taking the signal from one host and then repeating the signal out to other hosts. Even though they look the same and do functionally the same job, they do the job differently. Basically, hubs were stupid repeaters: anything sent in one port automatically went out all the other connected ports. Switches are smart repeaters: they memorize the MAC addresses of all the connected devices and only send out repeated signals to the correct host. This makes switched networks much faster than hubbed networks.

A simple example demonstrates the difference between hubs and switches. Let's say you have a network of 24 machines, all using 100-Mbps NICs attached to a 100-Mbps hub or switch. We would say the network's bandwidth is 100 Mbps. If you put the 24 systems on a 24-port 100-Mbps hub, you would have 24 computers sharing the 100 Mbps of bandwidth. A switch addresses this problem by making each port its own separate network. Each system gets to use the full bandwidth. The bottom line? Once switches became affordable, hubs went away.

The connection between a computer and a switch is called a segment. With most cable types, Ethernet segments are limited to 100 meters or less. You cannot use a splitter to split a single segment into two or more connections with an Ethernet network that uses this star bus topology. Doing so prevents the switch from recognizing which host is sending or receiving a signal, and no hosts connected to a split segment will be able to communicate. Splitters negatively affect signal quality.

Cheap and centralized, Ethernet's star bus topology does not go down if a single cable breaks. True, the network would go down if the switch failed, but that is rare.

Unshielded Twisted Pair

Unshielded twisted pair (UTP) cabling is the specified cabling for 100/1000BASE-T as well as 10GBASE-T and is the predominant cabling system used today. Many types of twisted pair cabling are available, and which type should be used depends on the needs of the network. Twisted pair cabling consists of AWG 22--26 gauge copper wire twisted together into color-coded pairs. Each wire is individually insulated and encased as a group in a common jacket.

EXAM TIP   Know the distinctions between copper and fiber optic cables when making decisions for an organization's infrastructure.

UTP cables come in categories that define the maximum speed at which data can be transferred (also called bandwidth). The major categories (Cats) are outlined in Table 18-1.

Table 18-1  Cat Levels

The Cat level should be clearly marked on the cable, as Figure 18-10 shows.

Figure 18-10  Cable markings for Cat level

The Telecommunication Industry Association (TIA) establishes the UTP categories, which fall under the ANSI/TIA 568 specification. The American National Standards Institute (ANSI) accredits TIA (and many other) standards so that they assure things work across industry and, equally importantly, along with international standards. Currently, most installers use Cat 5e, Cat 6, or Cat 6a cable.

Shielded Twisted Pair

Shielded twisted pair (STP), as its name implies, consists of twisted pairs of wires surrounded by shielding to protect them from electromagnetic interference (EMI). STP is pretty rare for 1000BASE-T networks, primarily because there's so little need for STP's shielding; it only really matters in locations with excessive electronic noise, such as a shop floor area with lots of lights, electric motors, or other machinery that could cause problems for other cables. Some STP cables are rated for direct burial. A cable rated for direct burial will have a thicker jacket, and some variety of waterproofing to make it suitable for outdoor open-air use or . . . direct burial underground.

Ethernet with Twisted Pair

The 10BASE-T and 100BASE-TX standards required two pairs of wires: a pair for sending and a pair for receiving. 10BASE-T ran on an ancient Cat version called Cat 3, but typically used at least Cat 5 cable. 100BASE-TX required at least Cat 5 to run. 1000BASE-T needs all four pairs of wires in Cat 5e and higher cables, and 10GBASE-T requires all four pairs, but in Cat 6 or higher. These cables use a connector called an RJ45 connector. The RJ (registered jack) designation was invented by Ma Bell (the phone company, for you youngsters) years ago and is still used today.

NOTE   There are Cat levels for connectors as well as cables. Don't even try to use a Cat 5e RJ45 connector with a Cat 6 cable.

Currently only two types of RJ connectors are used for networking: RJ11 and RJ45 (see Figure 18-11). RJ11 connects a traditional telephone to the telephone jack in the wall of your house. It supports up to two pairs of wires, though most phone lines use only one pair. The other pair is used to support a second phone line. RJ11 connectors are primarily used for telephone-based Internet connections (see Chapter 21). RJ45 is the standard for UTP connectors. RJ45 has connections for up to four pairs and is visibly much wider than RJ11. Figure 18-12 shows the position of the #1 and #8 pins on an RJ45 jack.

Figure 18-11  RJ11 (top) and RJ45 (bottom)

Figure 18-12  RJ45 pin numbers

Plenum Versus PVC Cabling

Most workplace installations of network cable go up above the ceiling and then drop down through the walls to present a nice port in the wall. The space in the ceiling, under the floors, and in the walls through which cable runs is called the plenum space. The potential problem with this cabling running through the plenum space is that the protective sheathing for networking cables, called the jacket, is made from plastic, and if you get any plastic hot enough, it creates smoke and noxious fumes.

Standard network cables usually use PVC (polyvinyl chloride) for the jacket, but PVC produces noxious fumes when burned. Fumes from cables burning in the plenum space can quickly spread throughout the building, so you want to use a more fire-retardant cable in the plenum space. Plenum-grade cable is simply network cabling with a fire-retardant jacket and is required for cables that go in the plenum space. Plenum-grade cable costs about three to five times more than PVC, but you should use it whenever you install cable in a plenum space.

ANSI/TIA has two standards for connecting the RJ45 connector to the UTP cable: T568A and T568B. Both are acceptable. You do not have to follow any standard as long as you use the same pairings on each end of the cable; however, you will make your life simpler if you choose a standard. Make sure that all of your cabling uses the same standard and you will save a great deal of work in the end. Most importantly, keep records!

Like all wires, the wires in UTP are numbered. A number does not appear on each wire, but rather each wire has a standardized color. Table 18-2 shows the official ANSI/TIA Standard Color Chart for UTP.

Table 18-2  UTP Cabling Color Char

SIM   Check out the "568B Wiring" Challenge! sim for Chapter 18. It'll help you memorize the wiring standard for the CompTIA A+ 1101 exam. You find it here: https://www.totalsem.com/110X.

Ethernet with Alternative Connections

UTP is very popular, but Ethernet, as well as other types of networks, can use alternative cabling that you need to be able to identify. Every CompTIA A+ certified tech needs to know about fiber optic cable and coaxial cable, so let's start there.

Fiber Optic

Fiber optic cable is a very attractive way to transmit Ethernet network frames. First, because it uses light instead of electricity, fiber optic cable is immune to electrical problems such as lightning, short circuits, and static. Second, fiber optic signals travel much farther, 2000 meters or more (compared with 100 meters on UTP). Many fiber Ethernet networks use 62.5/125 multimode fiber optic cable. All fiber Ethernet networks that use this type of cabling require two strands of fiber (one for sending and one for receiving). Figure 18-13 shows three of the more common connectors used in fiber optic networks. The round connector on the left is called a Straight tip, or ST connector. The square-shaped middle connecter is called a Subscriber connector, or SC connector, and on the far right is a Lucent connector, or LC connector.

Figure 18-13  Typical fiber optic cables with ST, SC, and LC connectors

Fiber optics are half-duplex, meaning data flows only one way---hence the need for two cables in a fiber installation. With the older ST and SC connectors, you needed two connectors on every fiber connection. Newer connectors like LC are designed to support two fiber cables in one connector, a real space saver.

Light can be sent down a fiber optic cable as regular light or as laser light. Each type of light requires totally different fiber optic cables. Fiber network technologies based on light-emitting diodes (LEDs) generate light signals that use multimode fiber optic cabling. Light entering a multimode fiber enters from many different angles and these different light rays bounce around the core of the cable. The multiple reflection angles tend to disperse over long distances, so multimode fiber optic cables are used for relatively short connections.

Network technologies that use laser light use single-mode fiber optic cabling. Using laser means that the light rays are aligned, reducing the dispersion over the length of the cable and allowing for phenomenally high transfer rates over long distances. That's why single-mode fiber optic cabling forms the backbone of the Internet!

There are close to 100 different Ethernet fiber optic cabling standards, with names like 10GBASE-SR and 100GBASE-LR1. The major difference is the speed of the network (there are also some important differences in the way systems interconnect, and so on). If you want to use fiber optic cabling, you need a fiber optic switch and fiber optic network cards.

Fiber networks follow the speed and distance limitations of their networking standard, so it's hard to pin down precise numbers on true limitations. Multimode overall is slower and has a shorter range than single-mode. A typical multimode network runs at 10 Gbps, though some can go to 100+ Gbps. Distances for multimode runs generally top out at ~600 meters. With single-mode, speed and distance---depending on the standard---can blow multimode away. The record transmission speed in 2021, for example, was 319 terabits per second, and that was over 1800 miles!

NOTE   There are a number of Ethernet standards that use fiber optic cable instead of UTP.

Coaxial

Early versions of Ethernet ran on coaxial cable instead of UTP. While the Ethernet standards using coax are long gone, coax lives on, primarily for cable modems and satellite connections. Coax cable consists of a center cable (core) surrounded by insulation. This in turn is covered with a shield of braided cable (see Figure 18-14). The center core actually carries the signal. The shield effectively eliminates outside interference. The entire cable is then surrounded by a protective insulating cover.

Figure 18-14  Typical coax

Coax cables are rated using an RG name. There are hundreds of RG ratings for coax, but the only two you need to know for the CompTIA A+ exam are RG-59 and RG-6. Both standards are rated by impedance, which is measured in ohms. (Impedance is the effective resistance to the flow of an alternating current electrical signal through a cable.) Both RG-6 and RG-59 have a 75-ohm impedance. Both of these coax cables are used by your cable television, but RG-59 is thinner and doesn't carry data quite as far as RG-6. The RG rating is clearly marked on the cable.

NOTE   Expect to see more use of the next step up from RG-6, called RG6QS (quad shield) coaxial cable, over the next few years. The extra shielding reduces interference and enables stronger internal signals, useful for pushing more data through the cable. (Think multiple 4K television signals and you'll be on the money about what's driving the upgrade.)

Coax uses a connector known as an F-type connector. You might already recognize this connector from the back of your cable modem or TV (see Figure 18-15). There is another type of connector called a BNC connector, but it is largely obsolete and you won't see it on the CompTIA A+ exam.

Figure 18-15  F-type connector

NOTE   Coaxial cable implementations can offer acceptable speeds, topping 2 Gbps in some cases. Using splitters to connect multiple hosts to a single cable, however, negatively affects signal quality, lowering the overall speed of the network.

Implementing Ethernet

Regardless of the cabling choice---UTP or fiber---Ethernet networks use a star bus topology. The illustration of a star presented earlier in the chapter in Figure 18-8 doesn't quite translate into real life, so let's turn briefly to look at common implementations of Ethernet.

The Typical LAN

A local area network (LAN) is a group of computers located physically close to each other---no more than a few hundred meters apart at most. A LAN might be in a single room, on a single floor, or in a single building. But I'm going to add that a LAN is almost always a group of computers that are able to "hear" each other when one of them sends a broadcast. A group of computers connected by one or more switches is a broadcast domain (see Figure 18-16), which means that all nodes receive broadcast frames from every other node.

Figure 18-16  Two broadcast domains---two separate LANs

EXAM TIP   For the CompTIA A+ exams, remember that a LAN is a group of networked computers that are close to each other. Also, remember that a LAN is almost always a broadcast domain.

You can set up a LAN in a small office/home office (SOHO) environment in several ways. The most common way---using wireless technology called Wi-Fi---dispenses with wires altogether. We'll get there in detail in Chapter 20.

Another option uses the existing electrical network in the building for connectivity. This option, called Ethernet over Power, requires specialized bridges that connect to power outlets. Ethernet over Power has its place in the right situations, and recent innovations have brought speeds up to almost matching Gigabit Ethernet. If you have a computer in a weird place where wireless won't work and traditional cables can't reach, try Ethernet over Power.

Structured Cabling

If you want a functioning, dependable, real-world network, you need a solid understanding of a set of standards collectively called structured cabling. These standards, defined by the ANSI/TIA---yes, the same folks who tell you how to crimp an RJ45 onto the end of a UTP cable---give professional cable installers detailed standards on every aspect of a cabled network, from the type of cabling to use to the standards on running cable in walls, even the position of wall outlets.

The CompTIA A+ exams require you to understand the basic concepts involved in installing network cabling and to recognize the components used in a network. The CompTIA A+ exams do not, however, expect you to be as knowledgeable as a professional network designer or cable installer. Your goal should be to understand enough about real-world cabling systems to communicate knowledgeably with cable installers and to perform basic troubleshooting. Granted, by the end of this section, you'll know enough to try running your own cable (I certainly run my own cable), but consider that knowledge extra credit.

The idea of structured cabling is to create a safe, reliable cabling infrastructure for all of the devices that may need interconnection. Certainly this applies to computer networks, but also to telephone, video---anything that might need low-power, distributed cabling.

NOTE   A structured cabling system is useful for more than just computer networks. You'll find structured cabling defining telephone networks and video conferencing setups, for example.

You should understand three issues with structured cabling. We'll start with the basics of how cables connect switches and computers. We'll then look at the components of a network, such as how the cable runs through the walls and where it ends up. This section wraps up with an assessment of connections leading outside your network.

Cable Basics---A Star Is Born

Earlier in this chapter we developed the idea of an Ethernet LAN in its most basic configuration: a switch, some UTP cable, and a few computers---in other words, a typical physical star network (see Figure 18-17).

Figure 18-17  A switch connected by UTP cable to two computers

No law of physics prevents you from placing a switch in the middle of your office and running cables on the floor to all the computers in your network. This setup works, but it falls apart spectacularly when applied to a real-world environment. Three problems present themselves to the network tech. First, the exposed cables running along the floor are just waiting for someone to trip over them, giving that person a wonderful lawsuit opportunity. Simply moving and stepping on the cabling will, over time, cause a cable to fail due to wires breaking or RJ45 connectors ripping off cable ends. Second, the presence of other electrical devices close to the cable can create interference that confuses the signals going through the wire. Third, this type of setup limits your ability to make any changes to the network. Before you can change anything, you have to figure out which cables in the huge rat's nest of cables connected to the switch go to which machines. Imagine that troubleshooting nightmare!

"Gosh," you're thinking (okay, I'm thinking it, but you should be, too), "there must be a better way to install a physical network." A better installation would provide safety, protecting the star from vacuum cleaners, clumsy coworkers, and electrical interference. It would have extra hardware to organize and protect the cabling. Finally, the new and improved star network installation would feature a cabling standard with the flexibility to enable the network to grow according to its needs and then to upgrade when the next great network technology comes along. That is the definition of structured cabling.

Structured Cable Network Components

Successful implementation of a basic structured cabling network requires three essential ingredients: a telecommunications room, horizontal cabling, and a work area. Let's zero in on one floor of a typical office. All the cabling runs from individual workstations to a central location, the telecommunications room. What equipment goes in there---a switch or a telephone system---is not the important thing. What matters is that all the cables concentrate in this one area.

All cables run horizontally (for the most part) from the telecommunications room to the workstations. This cabling is called, appropriately, horizontal cabling. A single piece of installed horizontal cabling is called a run. At the opposite end of the horizontal cabling from the telecommunications room is the work area. The work area is often simply an office or cubicle that potentially contains a workstation and a telephone. Figure 18-18 shows both the horizontal cabling and work areas.

Figure 18-18  Horizontal cabling and work areas

Each of the three parts of a basic star network---the telecommunications room, the horizontal cabling, and the work area(s)---must follow a series of strict standards designed to ensure that the cabling system is reliable and easy to manage. The cabling standards set by ANSI/TIA enable techs to make sensible decisions on equipment installed in the telecommunications room, so let's tackle horizontal cabling first, and then return to the telecommunications room. We'll finish up with the work area.

Horizontal Cabling  A horizontal cabling run is the cabling that goes more or less horizontally from a work area to the telecommunications room. In most networks, this cable is a Cat 5e or better UTP, but when you move into structured cabling, the ANSI/TIA standards define a number of other aspects of the cable, such as the type of wires, number of pairs of wires, and fire ratings.

EXAM TIP   A single piece of cable that runs from a work area to a telecommunications room is called a run. In most networks, this cable is Cat 5e or better UTP.

Solid Core Versus Stranded Core  All UTP cables come in one of two types: solid core or stranded core. Each wire in solid core UTP uses a single solid wire. With stranded core, each wire is actually a bundle of tiny wire strands. Each of these cable types has its benefits and downsides. Solid core is a better conductor, but it is stiff and will break if handled too often or too roughly. Stranded core is not quite as good a conductor, but it will stand up to substantial handling without breaking. Figure 18-19 shows a close-up of solid and stranded core UTP.

Figure 18-19  Solid and stranded core UTP

ANSI/TIA specifies that horizontal cabling should always be solid core. Remember, this cabling is going into your walls and ceilings, safe from the harmful effects of shoes and vacuum cleaners. The ceilings and walls enable you to take advantage of the better conductivity of solid core without the risk of cable damage. Stranded cable also has an important function in a structured cabling network, but I need to discuss a few more parts of the network before I talk about where to use stranded UTP cable.

The Telecommunications Room

The telecommunications room is the heart of the basic star. This room is where all the horizontal runs from all the work areas come together. The concentration of all this gear in one place makes the telecommunications room potentially one of the messiest parts of the basic star. Even if you do a nice, neat job of organizing the cables when they are first installed, networks change over time. People move computers, new work areas are added, network topologies are added or improved, and so on. Unless you impose some type of organization, this conglomeration of equipment and cables decays into a nightmarish mess.

Fortunately, the ANSI/TIA structured cabling standards define the use of specialized components in the telecommunications room that make organizing a snap. In fact, it might be fair to say that there are too many options! To keep it simple, we're going to stay with the most common telecommunications room setup and then take a short peek at some other fairly common options.

Equipment Racks  The central component of every telecommunications room is one or more equipment racks. An equipment rack provides a safe, stable platform for all the different hardware components. All equipment racks are 19 inches wide, but they vary in height from two- to three-foot-high models that bolt onto a wall (see Figure 18-20) to the more popular floor-to-ceiling models (see Figure 18-21).

Figure 18-20  A short equipment rack

Figure 18-21  A floor-to-ceiling rack

NOTE   Equipment racks evolved out of the railroad signaling racks from the 19th century. The components in a rack today obviously differ a lot from railroad signaling, but the 19-inch width has remained the standard for well over 100 years.

You can mount almost any network hardware component into a rack. All manufacturers make rack-mounted switches that mount into a rack with a few screws. These switches are available with a wide assortment of ports and capabilities. There are even rack-mounted servers, complete with slide-out keyboards, and rack-mounted uninterruptible power supplies (UPSs) to power the equipment (see Figure 18-22).

Figure 18-22  A rack-mounted UPS

All rack-mounted equipment uses a height measurement known simply as an RU. An RU is 1.75 inches. A device that fits in a 1.75-inch space is called a 1RU; a device designed for a 3.5-inch space is a 2RU; and a device that goes into a 7-inch space is called a 4RU. Most rack-mounted devices are 1RU, 2RU, or 4RU.

Patch Panels and Cables  Ideally, once you install horizontal cabling, you should never move it. As you know, UTP horizontal cabling has a solid core, making it pretty stiff. Solid core cables can handle some rearranging, but if you insert a wad of solid core cables directly into your switches, every time you move a cable to a different port on the switch, or move the switch itself, you will jostle the cable. You don't have to move a solid core cable many times before one of the solid copper wires breaks, and there goes a network connection!

Luckily for you, you can easily avoid this problem by using a patch panel. A patch panel is simply a box with a row of female connectors (ports) in the front and permanent connections in the back, to which you connect the horizontal cables (see Figure 18-23).

Figure 18-23  Typical patch panels

The most common type of patch panel today uses a special type of connector called a punchdown block, or sometimes called a 110-punchdown block. UTP cables connect to a punchdown block using a punchdown tool. Figure 18-24 shows a typical punchdown tool, and Figure 18-25 shows the punchdown tool punching down individual strands.

Figure 18-24  Punchdown tool

Figure 18-25  Punching down a punchdown block

The punchdown block has small metal-lined grooves for the individual wires. The punchdown tool has a blunt end that forces the wire into the groove. The metal in the groove slices the cladding enough to make contact.

EXAM TIP   The CompTIA A+ exams expect you to know that a punchdown tool is used for securing UTP connections to a punchdown block. It's not until you go for CompTIA Network+ certification that you'll be expected to know how to use these tools.

Not only do patch panels prevent the horizontal cabling from being moved, but they are also your first line of defense in organizing the cables. All patch panels have space in the front for labels, and these labels are the network tech's best friend! Simply place a tiny label on the patch panel to identify each cable, and you will never have to experience that sinking feeling of standing in the telecommunications room of your nonfunctioning network, wondering which cable is which. If you want to be a purist, there is an official, and rather confusing, ANSI/TIA labeling methodology called ANSI/TIA 606, but many real-world network techs simply use their own internal codes (see Figure 18-26).

Figure 18-26  Typical patch panels with labels

Patch panels are available in a wide variety of configurations that include different types of ports and numbers of ports. You can get UTP, STP, or fiber ports, and some manufacturers combine several different types on the same patch panel. Panels are available with 8, 12, 24, 48, or even more ports.

UTP patch panels, like UTP cables, come with Cat ratings, which you should be sure to check. Don't blow a good Cat 6 cable installation by buying a cheap patch panel---get a Cat 6 patch panel! A higher-rated panel supports earlier standards, so you can use a Cat 6 or even Cat 6a rack with Cat 5e cabling. Most manufacturers proudly display the Cat level right on the patch panel (see Figure 18-27).

Figure 18-27  Cat level on patch panel

Once you have installed the patch panel, you need to connect the ports to the switch through patch cables. Patch cables are short (typically two- to five-foot) UTP cables. Patch cables use stranded rather than solid cable, so they can tolerate much more handling. Even though you can make your own patch cables, most people buy premade ones. Buying patch cables enables you to use different-colored cables to facilitate organization (yellow for accounting, blue for sales, or whatever scheme works for you). Most prefabricated patch cables also come with a reinforced (booted) connector specially designed to handle multiple insertions and removals (see Figure 18-28).

Figure 18-28  Typical patch cable

Rolling Your Own Patch Cables  Although most people prefer simply to purchase premade patch cables, making your own is fairly easy. To make your own, use stranded UTP cable that matches the Cat level of your horizontal cabling. Stranded cable also requires specific crimps, so don't use crimps designed for solid cable. Crimping is simple enough, although getting it right takes some practice.

Figure 18-29 shows the main tool of the crimping trade: an RJ45 crimper with both a wire stripper, or cable stripper, and wire snips built in. Professional cable installers naturally have a wide variety of other tools as well.

Figure 18-29  Crimper with built-in stripper and snips

EXAM TIP   The CompTIA A+ exams expect you to know that a cable tech uses a crimper or crimping tool to attach an RJ45 to the end of a UTP cable.

Here are the steps for properly crimping an RJ45 onto a UTP cable. If you have some crimps, cable, and a crimping tool handy, follow along!

1\.   Cut the cable square using RJ45 crimpers or scissors.

2\.   Strip off one-half inch of plastic jacket from the end of the cable (see Figure 18-30).

Figure 18-30  Properly stripped cable

3\.   Slowly and carefully insert each individual wire into the correct location according to either ANSI/TIA 568A or B (see Figure 18-31). Unravel as little as possible.

Figure 18-31  Inserting the individual strands

4\.   Insert the crimp into the crimper and press (see Figure 18-32). Don't worry about pressing too hard; the crimper has a stop to prevent you from using too much pressure.

Figure 18-32  Crimping the cable

Figure 18-33 shows a nicely crimped cable. Note how the plastic jacket goes into the crimp. (The extra strands you can see along with the wires are called marker threads or ripcord. The Kevlar strands strengthen the cable and enable installers to rip the sheath off easily.)

Figure 18-33  Properly crimped cable

A good patch cable should include a boot. Figure 18-34 shows a boot being slid onto a newly crimped cable. Don't forget to slide each boot onto the patch cable before you crimp both ends!

Figure 18-34  Adding a boot

After making a cable, you need to test it to make sure it's properly crimped. I use a handy cable tester, available in any good electronics store, to verify all the individual wires are properly connected and in the correct location (see Figure 18-35).

Figure 18-35  Typical tester

The Work Area

From a cabling standpoint, a work area is nothing more than a wall outlet that serves as the termination point for horizontal network cables: a convenient insertion point for a workstation and a telephone. (In practice, of course, the term "work area" includes the office or cubicle.) A wall outlet itself consists of one or two female jacks to accept the cable, a mounting bracket, and a faceplate. You connect the workstation to the wall outlet with a patch cable (see Figure 18-36).

Figure 18-36  Typical work area outlet

The female RJ45 jacks in these wall outlets also have Cat ratings. You must buy Cat-rated jacks for wall outlets to go along with the Cat rating of the cabling in your network. In fact, many network connector manufacturers use the same connectors, often 110 punchdowns, in the wall outlets that they use on the patch panels (see Figure 18-37). These modular outlets significantly increase the ease of installation.

Figure 18-37  Punching down a modular jack

The last step is connecting the workstation to the wall outlet. Here again, most folks use a patch cable. Its stranded cabling stands up to the abuse caused by moving equipment, not to mention the occasional kick.

The work area may be the simplest part of the structured cabling system, but it is also the source of most network failures. When a user can't access the network and you suspect a broken cable, the first place to look is the work area.

Going Wide

A wide area network (WAN) is a widespread group of computers connected using long-distance technologies. You connect LANs into a WAN with a magical box called a router (see Figure 18-38). The best example of a WAN is the Internet.

Figure 18-38  Two broadcast domains connected by a router---a WAN

You can connect multiple smaller networks into a bigger network, turning a group of LANs into one big WAN, but this raises a couple of issues with network traffic. A computer needs some form of powerful, flexible addressing to address a frame so that it goes to a computer within its own LAN or to a computer on another LAN on the same WAN. Broadcasting is also unacceptable, at least between LANs. If every computer saw every frame, the network traffic would quickly spin out of control! Plus, the addressing scheme needs to work so that routers can sort the frames and send them along to the proper LAN. This process, called routing, requires routers and a routing-capable protocol to function correctly.

Routers destroy any incoming broadcast frames, by design. No broadcast frame can ever go through a router. This makes broadcasting still quite common within a single broadcast domain, but never anywhere else.

To go beyond a LAN requires a network protocol---a way machines agree to communicate---that can handle routing. That protocol, for the vast majority of networks, is called TCP/IP, and Chapter 19 begins with the details. For now, review the end-of-chapter material and take some practice exams. See you in Chapter 19!

CHAPTER 19

Local Area Networking

In this chapter, you will learn how to

-   Explain the basics of interconnecting networks with TCP/IP

-   Install and configure wired networks

-   Understand network organization and access controls

-   Troubleshoot wired networks

Networks dominate the modern computing environment. A vast percentage of businesses have PCs connected in a small local network, and big businesses simply can't survive without connecting their many offices into a single large network.

Because networks are so common today, every good tech needs to know the basics of networking technology, operating systems, implementation, and troubleshooting. Accordingly, this chapter teaches you how to build and troubleshoot a basic network.

The first part of this chapter explores the TCP/IP protocol suite and how Windows uses it in a typical network. Every modern network uses TCP/IP for communicating among devices. You need to know this stuff.

Next, we'll go through the process of setting up a small network from start to finish. This includes details on planning a network, installing and configuring network interface cards (NICs), setting up switches, and configuring TCP/IP.

From there, we'll turn to how we organize modern networks---and control access to all of the resources connected to them.

The chapter closes with troubleshooting a network. Modern operating systems come with plenty of tools to help you when the network stops functioning. I'll show you the tools and combine that with a troubleshooting process that helps you get a network up and running again.

1101/1102

Interconnecting Networks

Ethernet hardware protocol does a fine job of moving data directly from one machine to another inside our network, as you learned in Chapter 18. Up to this point, the only way to distinguish one machine from another is by the MAC address on its network interface card (NIC). But sending a message to any of the billions of networked devices in our world that aren't inside our network is a little more complicated. How, for example, would you address a device that doesn't even use Ethernet? (They exist!) How would you send a message to a laptop without knowing whether it's in Alaska or Antarctica?

These questions (and many others) about how to pass messages between networks are answered by another layer of software called the network protocol. Over the years there have been many network protocols, most combining multiple simple protocols into groups called protocol stacks or protocol suites, but Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP) is the primary protocol of most modern networks, including the Internet.

In contrast to physical MAC addresses directly tied to the hardware, IP introduces its own logical addressing scheme that isn't coupled to the hardware. IP addressing is hierarchical---devices higher up in each hierarchy know how to direct traffic to addresses within that hierarchy. Each device doesn't need to know exactly how to send a message to every other device---it just needs to know how to send it one step closer to the top of the hierarchy the recipient is under.

Just as switches (which filter and forward by MAC address) interconnect systems on a LAN, we can interconnect LANs themselves into larger wide area networks (WANs) with routers---devices that filter and forward by IP address. A single WAN (see Figure 19-1) might be under the control of a single organization---or it might interconnect multiple organizations, as the Internet does.

Figure 19-1  WAN concept

Every LAN that connects to the Internet must have a router to interconnect it with an Internet service provider (ISP). A typical SOHO router, like the one shown in Figure 19-2, will have two connections to enable it to connect to two different LANs, but large enterprise routers (like the ones at an ISP) may interconnect dozens of LANs.

Figure 19-2  Typical SOHO router

One port on the router connects to your LAN's switch and receives an IP address that's part of your network. The other port on the router connects to the next network, usually to your ISP, which in turn connects to millions of other routers and billions of other computers (see Figure 19-3). The IP address of the "LAN" side of your router (the port connected to your LAN) is the address your computer uses to send data to anything outside your network. This is called the default gateway.

Figure 19-3  Default gateway

In this section, we'll investigate a number of topics related to interconnecting networks, including the two IP network-addressing schemes (IPv4 and IPv6), the role DNS plays, the two main transmission protocols in the TCP/IP suite, and the settings and tools you should understand to actually work with TCP/IP.

Network Addressing with IPv4

Any network address must provide two pieces of information: it must uniquely identify the machine and it must locate that machine within the larger network. In a TCP/IP network, the IP address identifies the node and the network on which it resides. If you look at an IP address, it's not apparent which part of the address identifies the network and which part is the unique identifier of the computer.

IP Addresses

The IP address is the unique identification number for your system on the network. Many systems today still rely on the Internet Protocol version 4 (IPv4) addressing scheme. IPv4 addresses consist of four sets of eight binary numbers (octets), each set separated by a period. This is called dotted-decimal notation. So, instead of a computer being called SERVER1, it gets an address like so:

202.34.16.11

Written in binary form, the address would look like this:

11001010.00100010.00010000.00001011

To make the addresses more comprehensible to users, the TCP/IP folks decided to write the decimal equivalents:

00000000 = 0

00000001 = 1

00000010 = 2

. . .

11111111 = 255

Subnet Mask

Part of every IP address identifies the network (the network ID), and another part identifies the local computer (the host ID, or host) on the network. A NIC uses a value called the subnet mask to distinguish which part of the IP address identifies the network ID and which part of the address identifies the host. The subnet mask blocks out (or masks) the network portion of an IP address.

Let's look at a typical subnet mask: 255.255.255.0. When you compare the subnet mask to the IP address, any part that's all 255s is the network ID. Any part that's all zeros is the host ID. Look at the following example:

IP address: 192.168.4.33

Subnet mask: 255.255.255.0

Because the first three octets are 255, the network ID is 192.168.4 and the host ID is 33.

Every computer on a single LAN must have the same network ID and a unique host ID. That means every computer on the preceding network must have an IP address that starts with 192.168.4. Every computer on the network must have a unique IP address. If two computers have the same IP address, they won't be able to talk to each other, and other computers won't know where to send data. This is called an IP conflict.

You can never have an IP address that ends with a 0 or a 255, so for the preceding example, the LAN can have addresses starting at 192.168.4.1 and ending at 192.168.4.254: a total of 254 addresses.

Originally, subnets fell into "classes," such as A, B, or C, determined by the corresponding octet in the subnet mask. A Class C address, like the one just discussed, had a subnet mask of 255.255.255.0. A Class B address, in contrast, had a subnet mask of 255.255.0.0. The latter class left two full octets (16 bits) just for host numbers. That meant a single Class B network ID could have 216 -- 2 unique host IDs = 65,534 addresses. For completeness, note that a Class A address subnet mask was 255.0.0.0.

EXAM TIP   The addresses that start with "192.168." here are examples of private addresses. The architects of IP addressing sliced off three blocks of addresses for use in private networks---one apiece of Class A, Class B, and Class C. If you see an address that starts with "10.", it's a private address from that Class A block. An address that starts with "172.16--31" is from the Class B block, while an address starting with "192.168" is from the Class C block. All other IPv4 addresses are public addresses.

Although it's still common to see subnet masks as one to three groups of "255," the class system is long gone. Because the subnet mask numbers are binary, you can make a subnet with any number of ones in the subnet mask.

The current system is called Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR) and it works easily in binary, but a little less prettily when you show the numbers in the octets. A quick example should suffice to illustrate this point.

A subnet mask of 255.255.255.0 translates into binary as such:

11111111.11111111.11111111.00000000

With CIDR, network techs refer to the subnet mask by the number of ones it contains. The preceding subnet mask, for example, has 24 ones. Jill the tech would call this subnet a /24 (whack twenty-four). As you've seen already, a /24 network ID offers up to 254 host IDs.

If you want a network ID that enables more host IDs, buy one that has a subnet mask with fewer ones, like this one:

11111111.11111111.11110000.00000000

Count the ones. (There are 20.) The ones mask the network ID. That leaves 12 digits for the host IDs. Do the binary math: 212 -- 2 = 4094 unique addresses in a single /20 network ID.

When you change the binary number---11110000---to an octet, you get the following:

255.255.240.0

It might look a little odd to a new tech, but that's a perfectly acceptable subnet mask. The binary behind the octets works.

From a practical standpoint, all you must know as a tech is how to set up a computer to accept an IP address and subnet mask combination that your network administrator tells you to use.

Network Addressing with IPv6

When the early developers of the Internet set out to create an addressing or naming scheme for devices on the Internet, they faced several issues. Of course, they needed to determine how the numbers or names worked, and for that they developed the Internet Protocol and IP addresses. But beyond that, they had to determine how many computers might exist in the future, and then make the IP address space even bigger to give Internet naming longevity. But how many computers would exist in the future?

The 32-bit IPv4 standard offers only 4 billion addresses. That was plenty in the beginning, but seemed insufficient once the Internet went global.

The Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) developed an IP addressing scheme called Internet Protocol version 6 (IPv6) that is slowly replacing IPv4. IPv6 extends the 32-bit IP address space to 128 bits, allowing up to 2128 addresses---that should hold us for the foreseeable future!

NOTE   If you really want to know how many IP addresses IPv6 provides, here's your number: 340,282,366,920,938,463,463,374,607,431,768,211,456. Say that three times fast!

Although they achieve the same function---enabling computers on IP networks to send packets to each other---IPv6 and IPv4 differ a lot when it comes to implementation. This section provides you with a quick overview to get you up to speed with IPv6 and show you how it differs from IPv4.

EXAM TIP   IPv4 addresses use 32 bits and IPv6 addresses use 128 bits. Be sure you can identify their address length differences and address conventions.

IPv6 Address Notation

The notation for a familiar 32-bit IPv4 address---such as 197.169.94.82---contains four octets separated by a period. The 128-bit IPv6 addresses are written like this:

2001:0000:0000:3210:0800:200c:00cf:1234

IPv6 uses a colon as a separator, instead of the period used in IPv4's dotted-decimal format. Each group is a hexadecimal number between 0000 and ffff called, unofficially, a field or hextet.

EXAM TIP   You'll see the hexadecimal letters in IPv6 written both uppercase and lowercase. It doesn't matter to the computer, but the people behind IPv6 insist (per RFC 5952) that notation should be lowercase. That's the convention used here. You might see the letters uppercase on the CompTIA A+ exam. It's all the same, so don't get thrown off!

NOTE   For those who don't play with hex regularly, one hexadecimal character (for example, F/f) represents 4 bits, so four hexadecimal characters make a 16-bit group. For some reason, the IPv6 developers didn't provide a name for the "group of four hexadecimal characters," so many techs and writers have taken to calling them fields or "hextets" to distinguish them from IPv4 "octets."

A complete IPv6 address always has eight groups of four hexadecimal characters. If this sounds like you're going to type in really long IP addresses, don't worry, IPv6 offers a number of ways to shorten the address in written form.

First, leading zeros can be dropped from any group, so 00cf becomes cf and 0000 becomes 0. Let's rewrite the previous IPv6 address using this shortening method:

2001:0:0:3210:800:200c:cf:1234

Second, you can remove one or more consecutive groups of all zeros, leaving the two colons together. For example, using the :: rule, you can write the previous IPv6 address as

2001::3210:800:200c:cf:1234

You can remove any number of consecutive groups of zeros to leave a double colon, but you can only use this trick once in an IPv6 address.

Take a look at this IPv6 address:

fe80:0000:0000:0000:00cf:0000:ba98:1234

Using the double-colon rule, you can reduce four groups of zeros; three of them follow the fe80 and the fourth comes after 00cf. Because of the "only use once" stipulation, the best and shortest option is to convert the address to this:

fe80::cf:0:ba98:1234

You may not use a second :: to represent the fourth groups of zeros---only one :: is allowed per address! This rule exists for a good reason. If more than one :: was used, how could you tell how many groups of zeros were in each group? Answer: you couldn't.

Here's an example of a very special IPv6 address that takes full advantage of the double-colon rule, the IPv6 loopback address:

::1

Without using the double-colon nomenclature, this IPv6 address would look like this:

0000:0000:0000:0000:0000:0000:0000:0001

NOTE   The unspecified address (all zeros) can never be used, and neither can an address that contains all ones (in binary) or all fs (in hex notation).

IPv6 uses the "/x" prefix length naming convention, similar to the CIDR naming convention in IPv4. Here's how to write an IP address and prefix length for a typical IPv6 host:

fe80::cf:0:ba98:1234/64

Where Do IPv6 Addresses Come From?

With IPv4, IP addresses come from one of two places: either you type in the IP address yourself (static IP addressing) or you use DHCP (also called dynamic IP addressing). With IPv6, addressing works very differently. Instead of one IP address, you will have multiple IPv6 addresses on a single network card.

SIM   Check out the excellent "IPv6 Address" Type! simulation in the Chapter 19 section of https://www.totalsem.com/110x. It's good for reinforcing your knowledge of IPv6 and getting practice with performance-based questions.

When a computer running IPv6 first boots up, it gives itself a link-local address, IPv6's equivalent to IPv4's APIPA/zeroconf address (we'll explore APIPA/zeroconf later in this chapter). Although an APIPA/zeroconf address can indicate a loss of network connectivity or a problem with the DHCP server, computers running IPv6 always have a link-local address. The first 64 bits of a link-local address are always fe80::, which means every address always begins with fe80:0000:0000:0000. If your operating system supports IPv6 and IPv6 is enabled, you can see this address. Figure 19-4 shows the link-local address for a typical system running the ipconfig utility.

Figure 19-4  Link-local address in ipconfig

The second 64 bits of a link-local address, the interface ID, are generated in two ways. Every current operating system generates a 64-bit random number. Very old operating systems, such as Windows XP and Windows Server 2003, used the device's MAC address to create a 64-bit number called an Extended Unique Identifier, 64-bit (EUI-64).

The link-local address does all the hard work in IPv6, and, as long as you don't need an Internet connection, it's all you need. The old concepts of static and DHCP addressing don't really make much sense in IPv6 unless you have dedicated servers (even in IPv6, servers generally still have static IP addresses). Link-local addressing takes care of all your local network needs.

IPv6 Prefix Lengths

Systems use IPv6 prefix lengths to determine whether to send packets to a local MAC address or to the default gateway to send the packets out to the Internet. But you need to focus on two rules:

-   The last 64 bits of an IPv6 address are generated by the NIC, leaving a maximum of 64 bits for the prefix. Therefore, no prefix is ever longer than /64.

-   The five Regional Internet Registries (RIRs) pass out /48 prefixes to big ISPs and end users who need large allotments. ISPs and others will borrow another 16 bits for subnetting and then pass out /64 interface IDs to end users. Link-local addressing uses a prefix length of /64. Other types of IPv6 addresses get the subnet information automatically from their routers.

Global Unicast Addresses

To get on the Internet, a system needs a second IPv6 address called a global unicast address, often referred to as a "global address." The most common way to get a global address is to request it from the default gateway router, which must be configured to pass out global IPv6 addresses. When you plug a computer into a network, it sends out a very special packet called a router solicitation (RS) message, looking for a router (see Figure 19-5). The router hears this message and responds with a router advertisement (RA). This RA tells the computer its network ID and subnet (together called the prefix) and DNS server (if configured---more on DNS in a moment).

Figure 19-5  Getting a global unicast address

NOTE   A router solicitation message uses the address ff02::2. This address is read only by other computers running IPv6 in the network. This type of address is different from a broadcast address and is called a multicast address. In IPv6, there is no broadcast, only multicast!

Once the computer gets a prefix, it generates the rest of the address just like with the link-local address. The computer ends up with a legitimate, 128-bit public IPv6 address as well as a link-local address. Figure 19-6 shows the IPv6 information in macOS.

Figure 19-6  macOS system with a global IPv6 address

A global address is a true Internet address. If another computer is running IPv6 and also has a global address, it can access your system unless you have some form of firewall.

EXAM TIP   Computers using IPv6 need a global unicast address to access the Internet.

The addition of IPv6 makes programs such as ipconfig complex. Figure 19-7 shows ipconfig information from a Windows 10 computer.

Figure 19-7  The ipconfig command with IPv6 and IPv4

Domain Name System

Knowing that users could not remember lots of IP addresses, early Internet pioneers came up with a way to correlate those numbers with more human-friendly designations. The system they came up with is called the Domain Name System (DNS). Special computers, called DNS servers, keep databases that associate IP addresses with names (and store other related information---more on this in a moment).

For example, let's say a machine with the IP address 34.200.194.131 hosts a Web site and we want it to be known as www.totalsem.com. When we set up the Web site, we would pay for a DNS server to register the DNS name www.totalsem.com to the IP address 34.200.194.131. So instead of typing "https://34.200.194.131" to access the Web page, you could type "www.totalsem.com" and press enter. Your system would then query the DNS server to get www.totalsem.com's IP address and use that to find the right machine. Unless you want to type in IP addresses all the time, you'll need to use DNS servers (see Figure 19-8).

Figure 19-8  Domain name system

The Internet regulates domain names. If you want a domain name that others may access on the Internet, you must register your domain name and pay a small yearly fee. Originally, DNS names all ended with one of the following seven domain name qualifiers, called top-level domains (TLDs):

NOTE   Today, Web servers often host multiple Web sites using the same IP address. Don't be surprised if trying to access a site via IP address rather than name doesn't work like you expect.

As more and more countries joined the Internet, a new level of domains was added to the original seven to indicate a DNS name from a country, such as .uk for the United Kingdom. It's common to see DNS names such as www.bbc.co.uk or www.louvre.fr. The Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN) has added tons more generic domains such as .name, .app, and .blog.

A lot of the power of DNS comes from the fact that the database stores a little bit more than just an IP address and the associated name. DNS has several different types of record, and it can store more than one of each for a given name. The CompTIA A+ 1101 objectives only want you to know about address records (A and AAAA) and two types that play a big role in e-mail: MX and TXT records.

Address Records

Address records are how the DNS database keeps track of the names of individual systems on a network. Each individual A record associates one name with an IPv4 address, and each AAAA record associates one name with an IPv6 address. If you need to associate a human-friendly name like "accounting" with the accounting department's file server, you'll create an A or AAAA record.

MX Records

MX records enable the servers that handle outgoing e-mail to figure out where e-mail for each domain should go. I let Microsoft 365 handle my e-mail, so the MX record for totalsem.com points to the domain that Microsoft 365 uses for incoming mail. If you shoot me an e-mail at mike@totalsem.com, your outgoing mail server will look up the MX record and know to send the mail on to Microsoft's server.

MX officially stands for mail exchange, though the CompTIA A+ 1101 objectives use the term mail exchanger.

TXT Records

Text (TXT) records are the junk drawer of the DNS database. People use these free-form records to hold all kinds of things---but the CompTIA A+ 1101 objectives only want you to know the role they play in spam management. For decades e-mail administrators waged a battle with scammers who send mountains of unwanted e-mail---spam---24 hours a day. To that end, TXT records have three anti-spam purposes:

-   DomainKeys Identified Mail (DKIM) records Enable receiving servers to verify that the messages they receive were signed by the sending server and have not been altered by intermediate servers.

-   Sender Policy Framework (SPF) records List the IP or DNS addresses allowed to send e-mail for a domain, enabling receiving servers to discard or flag messages sent by illegitimate servers.

-   Domain-based Message Authentication, Reporting, and Conformance (DMARC) records Enable domain owners to indicate what receiving servers should do with e-mail that fails the DKIM or SPF checks. They also enable domain owners to receive reports from large e-mail providers about the origin of the mail they received from the domain.

EXAM TIP   These spam management records help others deal with spam claiming to come from your domain. Many servers ignore your mail if you don't set them up. Organizations that manage their own e-mail may run an anti-spam gateway server to dust out spam sent to their users. If so, this anti-spam gateway appliance will also check and enforce the DKIM, SPF, and DMARC records of domains that send it mail.

Entering Client IP Information

When you're configuring a computer to connect to a network, the operating system must provide you an interface to enter the IP address, the subnet mask, the default gateway, and at least one DNS server. Let's review:

-   IP address Your computer's unique address on the network

-   Subnet mask Identifies your network ID

-   Default gateway IP address on the LAN side of your router

-   DNS server Tracks easy-to-remember DNS names for IP addresses

There are two ways to enter IP information on the operating system: statically or dynamically. Figure 19-9 shows the IP settings dialog box. Here you can enter the information statically.

Figure 19-9  IP settings on a Windows 10 system

As you look at Figure 19-9, note the radio button for Obtain an IP address automatically. This is a common setting for which you don't need to enter any information. You can use this setting if your network uses Dynamic Host Control Protocol (DHCP). If you have DHCP (most networks do) and your computer is configured to obtain an IP address automatically, your computer boots up and will broadcast a DHCP request.

A DHCP server manages a range of IP addresses (also called its pool or scope). It provides your computer with an address from this pool in the form of a lease containing all the IP information it needs to get on the network (see Figure 19-10) along with the expiration time (after which the computer will need to ask the DHCP server to renew the lease).

Figure 19-10  A DHCP server handing out an IP address

NOTE   Lease duration is up to the administrator of the DHCP server. Most home and office servers default to leases that last about a week. But for busy networks that have lots of computers coming and going, like a school's student Wi-Fi network, lease times can be as short as an hour.

As previously mentioned (and shown in Figure 19-9), you can also manually input an IP address, creating a static IP address. Static means it doesn't change until you or some other tech changes it manually. You can also set up the DHCP server to always give a specific IP address to a certain device, such as a server or printer, based on its MAC address. This is called a DHCP reservation. Typically, servers have a reserved IP address if they have not been manually configured.

TCP vs. UDP

When moving data from one system to another, the TCP/IP protocol suite needs to know if the communication is connection-oriented or connectionless. When you want to be positive that the data moving between two systems gets there in good order, use a connection-oriented application. If it's not a big deal for data to miss a bit or two, then connectionless is the way to go. The connection-oriented protocol used with TCP/IP is called the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP). The connectionless one is called the User Datagram Protocol (UDP). Let me be clear: you don't choose TCP or UDP. The people who developed the applications decide which protocol to use.

EXAM TIP   Expect a question on the CompTIA A+ 1101 exam about TCP vs. UDP. Think connection-oriented vs. connectionless and you'll get the right answer. The objectives also mention DHCP and TFTP as examples of connectionless protocols, and HTTPS and SSH as connection-oriented. Look for more details on TFTP, HTTPS, and SSH in Chapter 21.

Most TCP/IP applications use TCP. TCP gets an application's data from one machine to another reliably and completely without the application developer having to think about how to deal with missing packets. As a result, TCP comes with communication rules that require both the sending and receiving machines to acknowledge the other's presence and readiness to send and receive data.

UDP is the "fire and forget" missile of the TCP/IP protocol suite. UDP doesn't possess any of the extras you see in TCP to make sure the data is received intact. UDP works best when you have a lot of data to send that doesn't need to be perfect or when the application has other ways to deal with any missing packets. A few dropped packets on a Voice over IP (VoIP) call, for example, won't make much difference in the communication between two people. So there's a good reason to use UDP: it's smoking fast compared to TCP.

NOTE   The CompTIA A+ exams expect you to know about other TCP/IP protocols for communicating over the Internet. They're all covered in Chapter 21.

TCP/IP Settings

TCP/IP has a number of unique settings that you must configure correctly to ensure proper network functionality. Unfortunately, these settings can be quite confusing, and there are several of them. Not all settings are used for every type of TCP/IP network, and it's not always obvious where you go to set them.

In Windows 10, you can configure network settings from the Settings app or appropriate Control Panel applet. Go to Start | Settings | Network & Internet | Status. Click Change adapter options under the Advanced network settings field on the right to get to installed NICs. The Windows 11 Settings app moves things around a little, but from Network & Internet click Advanced network settings and then select the NIC you want to configure.

The CompTIA A+ certification exams assume that someone else, such as a tech support person or some network guru, will tell you the correct TCP/IP settings for the network. You need to understand roughly what those settings do and to know where to enter them so the system works.

TCP/IP Tools

All modern operating systems come with handy tools to test and configure TCP/IP. Those you're most likely to use in the field are ping, ipconfig, ifconfig, ip, nslookup, dig, tracert, and traceroute. All of these programs are command-line utilities. Open a command prompt to run them.

ping

The ping command provides a really great way to see if you can talk to another system. Here's how it works. Get to a command prompt or terminal and run ping followed by an IP address or by a DNS name, such as ping google.com. Press the ENTER key and away it goes! Figure 19-11 shows the common syntax for ping.

Figure 19-11  The ping command's syntax on Windows

The ping command has a few useful options beyond the basics. The first option to try in Windows is the -t switch. If you use the -t switch, ping continuously sends ping packets until you stop it with the break command (CTRL-C). That's the default behavior for ping in macOS and Linux; you press CTRL-C again to make it stop. The second option in Windows is the -l switch, which enables you to specify how big a ping packet to send. This helps in diagnosing specific problems with the routers between your computer and the computer you ping.

ipconfig/ifconfig/ip

Windows offers the command-line tool ipconfig for a quick glance at your network settings. From a command prompt, run ipconfig/ all to see all of your TCP/IP settings (see Figure 19-12). The ifconfig command in macOS and other Unixes provides the same level of detail with no switches applied. Much of the Linux world has moved on to the Linux-specific ip command, which is stuffed to the gills with cool features. You can run ip address to get the equivalent information.

Figure 19-12  An ipconfig /all command in Windows 10

When you have a static IP address, ipconfig does little beyond reporting your current IP settings, including your IP address, subnet mask, default gateway, DNS servers, and WINS servers. When using DHCP, however, ipconfig is also the primary tool for releasing and renewing your IP address. Just run ipconfig /renew to get a new IP address or ipconfig /release to give up the IP address you currently have.

nslookup/dig

The nslookup command is a powerful command-line program that enables you to determine exactly what information the DNS server is giving you about a specific host name. Every modern OS makes nslookup available when you install TCP/IP, though on Unixes I recommend the dig command, which provides more verbose---and more technical---output by default. Figure 19-13 compares what you'll see if you run nslookuptotalsem.com and dig totalsem.com.

Figure 19-13  Running nslookup and dig in macOS

NOTE   If you run nslookup by itself, you'll note that the prompt changes. That's because you're running the application interactively. You can run additional nslookup commands without the "nslookup" prefix. Run exit to return to the command prompt.

tracert/traceroute

The tracert (Windows) and traceroute (macOS, Linux) utilities show the route that a packet takes to get to its destination. From a command line, type tracert or traceroute followed by a space and an IP address or URL. The output describes the route from your machine to the destination machine, including all devices the packet passes through and how long each hop between devices takes (see Figure 19-14).

Figure 19-14  The tracert command in action

EXAM TIP   On Windows you can also use the pathping command to see similar information to tracert---but with a better statistical summary of the multiple connection attempts it makes.

These commands can help troubleshoot bottlenecks. You can run them to see if a TCP/IP problem is on a machine or connection you control or if you need to contact another network's administrators. The path can differ each time when the destination or networks along the way use a load balancer to spread traffic out over several routes or servers. You might even notice that an intermittent problem only rears its head when packets take a specific route or reach a particular destination server!

Try This!

Running tracert/traceroute

Ever wonder why your e-mail takes years to get to some people but arrives instantly for others? Or why some Web sites are slower to load than others? Part of the blame could lie with how many hops away your connection is from the target server. You can use tracert/traceroute to run a quick check of how many hops it takes to get to somewhere on a network, so try this!

1\.   Run tracert or traceroute on some known source, such as www.microsoft.com or www.totalsem.com. How many hops did it take? Did your tracert/traceroute time out or make it all the way to the server?

2\.   Try a tracert/traceroute to a local address. If you're in a university town, run a tracert or traceroute on the campus Web site, such as www.rice.edu for folks in Houston, or www.ucla.edu for those of you in Los Angeles. Did you get fewer hops with a local site?

Configuring TCP/IP

By default, TCP/IP is configured to receive an IP address automatically from a DHCP server on the network (and automatically assign a corresponding subnet mask). As far as the CompTIA A+ certification exams are concerned, Network+ techs and administrators give you the client network configuration settings---the IP address, subnet mask, and default gateway information---and you plug them into the PC. Here's how to do it manually:

1\.   In Windows 10/11, open the Settings app and click Network and Internet. From here, you can click the Properties button of an already connected network. If the adaptor you want to configure is not connected, select the adaptor type from the sidebar (Ethernet for instance), then click the name of the adaptor.

2\.   In the properties screen, click the Edit button under the IP setting header and then select Manual from the drop-down menu if currently in Automatic (DHCP) mode.

3\.   In manual mode, click the toggle switch under IPv4 to reveal the address fields (see Figure 19-15)

Figure 19-15  Configuring a static IP in Windows 10

4\.   Enter the IP address in the appropriate field.

5\.   Press the TAB key to skip down to the Subnet prefix length field (Subnet mask in Windows 11). Note that in Windows 10 you need to enter the subnet in CIDR form (Windows 11 switched back to subnet mask format). As a quick refresher, 255.255.255.0 is 24 in CIDR format.

6\.   Optionally, enter the IP address for a default gateway.

7\.   Optionally, enter the IP addresses of a Preferred DNS server and an Alternate DNS server (such as those run by Google or Cloudflare).

8\.   Click the Save button to close the Properties dialog box.

EXAM TIP   Before Microsoft moved these settings into the Settings app, we used the Network and Sharing Center applet in the Control Panel to do it. Even though you can use the Settings app to configure these in Windows 10/11, the CompTIA A+ 1102 objectives expect you to know that you can use the Network and Sharing Center for the same scenarios in Windows 10!

Automatic Private IP Addressing

Modern operating systems support a feature called Automatic Private IP Addressing (APIPA) in Windows or zeroconf in other operating systems that automatically assigns an IP address to the system when the client cannot obtain an IP address automatically. The Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA), the nonprofit corporation responsible for assigning IP addresses and managing root servers, has set aside the range of addresses from 169.254.0.1 to 169.254.255.254 for this purpose.

If the computer system cannot contact a DHCP server, the computer randomly chooses an address in the form of 169.254.x.y (where x.y is the computer's identifier) and a 16-bit subnet mask (255.255.0.0) and broadcasts it on the network segment (subnet). If no other computer responds to the address, the system assigns this address to itself. When using APIPA/zeroconf, the system can communicate only with other computers on the same subnet that also use the 169.254.x.y range with a 16-bit mask. APIPA/zeroconf is enabled by default if your system is configured to obtain an IP address automatically.

NOTE   A computer system on a network with an active DHCP server that has an IP address in this range usually indicates a problem connecting to the DHCP server.

Installing and Configuring a Wired Network

To have network connectivity, you need to have three things in place:

-   Connected NIC The physical hardware that connects the computer system to the network media.

-   Properly configured IP addressing Your device needs correct IP addressing for your network, either via DHCP or static.

-   Switch Everything connects to a switch in a wired network.

If you want to share resources on your PC with other network users, you also need to enable Microsoft's File and Printer Sharing. When you install a NIC, by default Windows installs upon setup the TCP/IP protocol, the Client for Microsoft Networks, and File and Printer Sharing for Microsoft Networks. macOS computers come fully set up for networking. Different Linux distros offer setup options similar to the Windows options.

Installing a NIC

The NIC is your computer system's link to the network, and installing one is the first step required to connect to a network. This used to be a big deal and might show up as such in a CompTIA A+ scenario question, but every modern desktop computer has a built-in Gigabit NIC. Windows will automatically install a driver for the NIC at installation.

Full-Duplex and Half-Duplex

All modern NICs run in full-duplex mode, meaning they can send and receive data at the same time. The vast majority of NICs and switches use a feature called autosensing to accommodate very old devices that might attach to the network and need to run in half-duplex mode. Half-duplex means that the device can send and receive, but not at the same time. If you need to adjust the duplex or the speed of the NIC manually, you can do so in the NIC's Properties dialog box. Open the Network and Sharing Center in Control Panel and select Change adapter settings. In the Network Connections window, right-click the NIC you want to change and select Properties. Click Configure to get to the NIC settings. Click the Advanced tab and scroll down in the Property section until you find Speed & Duplex. Adjust the Value on the right to match whatever ancient device is giving you problems (see Figure 19-16).

Figure 19-16  Adjusting the Speed & Duplex settings of a NIC in Windows

Link Lights

Network interfaces have some type of light-emitting diode (LED) status indicator that gives information about the state of the NIC's link to whatever is on the other end of the connection. Even though you know the lights are actually LEDs, get used to calling them link lights, because that's the term all network techs use. NICs can have between one and four different link lights, and the LEDs can be any color. These lights give you clues about what's happening with the link and are one of the first items to check whenever you think a system is disconnected from the network (see Figure 19-17).

Figure 19-17  Mmmm, pretty lights!

Switches also have link lights, enabling you to check the connectivity at both ends of the cable. If a PC can't access a network, always check the link lights first. Multispeed devices usually have a link light that tells you the speed of the connection. In Figure 19-18, the left link light for port 2 is lit, but the right link light is not, signifying that the other end of the cable is plugged into a 100BASE-T NIC. Port 1, on the other hand, has both link lights lit. It's clearly Gigabit.

Figure 19-18  Multispeed lights

A properly functioning link light is steady on when the NIC is connected to another device. No flickering, no on and off, just on. A link light that is off or flickering shows a connection problem.

Another light is the activity light. This little guy turns on when the card detects network traffic, so it makes an intermittent flickering when operating properly. The activity light is a lifesaver for detecting problems, because in the real world, the connection light sometimes lies to you. If the connection light says the connection is good, the next step is to try to copy a file or do something else to create network traffic. If the activity light does not flicker, you have a problem.

On many NICs, a properly functioning link light is on and steady when the NIC is connected to another device---no flickering indicates a good connection. Some NICs use a single LED to display both the link and activity status, in which case the single LED will flicker with activity. That's how the NIC shown in Figure 19-17 works. Read the online documentation from the NIC manufacturer's Web site to determine the meaning of the lights and their steadiness or flickering.

EXAM TIP   Though no real standard exists for NIC LEDs, you should know that a solid green light means connectivity, a flashing green light means intermittent connectivity, no green light means no connectivity, and a flashing amber light means there are collisions on the network (which is sometimes okay). Also, know that the first things you should check when having connectivity issues are the NIC's LEDs.

Wake-on-LAN

A popular feature of most NICs is the ability to turn on or wake up a powered-down or sleeping PC. You'll learn more about power management in Chapter 23, but for now, know that Wake-on-LAN is handy when you want to wake up one or multiple computers that you aren't physically near. To wake up a PC with Wake-on-LAN, you'll need to use a second PC to send either a special pattern or a magic packet (a broadcast packet that essentially repeats the destination MAC address many times).

A powered-down or sleeping PC knows to look for this special pattern or packet, at least after configured to do so. Go to the Control Panel and open Network and Sharing Center. Click Manage network connections or Change adapter settings on the left. For all versions of Windows, right-click the adapter and select Properties. Click the Configure button in the Properties dialog box and then select the Power Management tab (see Figure 19-19). To enable Wake-on-LAN, make sure the checkbox next to Allow this device to wake the computer is checked. Optionally, you can select Only allow a magic packet to wake the computer, which will instruct the NIC to ignore everything but magic packets.

Figure 19-19  Wake-on-LAN settings on the Power Management tab

Wake-on-LAN is very convenient, but it has one nasty downside. As noted in the Properties dialog box, Wake-on-LAN can wake up or turn on laptops using wireless connections, even when they aren't plugged in or are inside a carrying case. Don't let your laptop overheat or drain its battery---unless you know that you'll need it, turn off Wake-on-LAN on your laptop.

QoS

Quality of service (QoS) enables busy networks to prioritize traffic. While we'll look at QoS from the router's perspective in Chapter 21, individual systems play an important role in the QoS process by tagging their frames, enabling networking hardware to treat them according to rules defined by network administrators. Support for QoS tagging (or priority) should be enabled by default on most network adapters---but if you need to modify this setting, you can find the VLAN option on the Advanced tab of your NIC's Properties dialog box (see Figure 19-20).

Figure 19-20  Network adapter VLAN setting

NOTE   Your BIOS might also have settings for controlling Wake-on-LAN functions. Check your CMOS System Configuration tool to find out.

Configuring IP Addressing

This one's easy. All operating systems by default will be set for DHCP and acquire IP addressing settings automatically. This is true for both IPv4 and IPv6 configuration options. On the off-chance scenario where you need to configure a client to use a static IP address, you can readily do so.

Connecting to a Switch

Every wired computer connects to a switch, enabling communication with other computers on the network. Networks feature two types of switches, unmanaged and managed. An unmanaged switch is an automatic device. Plug devices into it and they will communicate via MAC addresses with no configuration needed by techs. An unmanaged switch doesn't do much more than connecting devices.

A managed switch offers a lot of extra features that modern networks use to provide added security and efficiency. Managed switches have an IP address that you can use to configure the options. Figure 19-21 shows a managed switch interface. Dealing with managed switches falls into the realm of CompTIA Network+ and CompTIA Security+ techs, but if you run into a scenario where you need to access such a switch, know that you'll access it via IP address with either a web browser or via the command line.

Figure 19-21  Managed switch interface

EXAM TIP   I'm glossing over the complexity involved with managed switches. Some switches have a simple interface like the one pictured in Figure 19-21. Switches (or other devices) that take advantage of software-defined networking (SDN) are automatically managed by a separate controller elsewhere on the network.

Let me give you one great example of the power of managed switches: VLANs. You can use special managed switches to break up or segment a single physical network into two or more distinct networks. Each virtual local area network (VLAN) you create can talk with other computers within the same VLAN, but not to computers on another VLAN. Here's the cool part. You can have a single switch with, say, 24 computers connected. Normally, all 24 would be on the same network, right? But with a VLAN-capable switch, you can access the management console and assign physical ports to different VLANs. You could assign ports 1 through 12 to VLAN100 and ports 13 through 24 to VLAN200. Computers connected to ports 12 and 13 wouldn't even know the other computer was there. I'll save the big discussion of VLANs and cool things you can do with managed switches for the CompTIA Network+ book in your near future.

Network Organization and Access Control

Windows systems can share all kinds of resources across your network: files, folders, entire drives, printers, faxes, Internet connections, and much more. To make it easy to find the right resources and control who should be able to access them, networks (including all of their systems and users) need to be organized in some way to make human sense of all of the wires and addresses. This section looks at how resources (such as files and printers) are shared on a network and explores the two main approaches to organizing modern Windows networks: workgroups and domains.

Shared Resources

When you share resources over a network, every OS uses specific network sharing permissions to allow access, restrict access, or deny access to shared resources. These permissions do not have anything to do with file- or folder-level permissions like the NTFS permissions you saw in Chapter 13 (though file- and folder-level permissions do affect the share permissions). They're also less sophisticated---they don't, for example, support NTFS features such as inheritance.

EXAM TIP   Windows file and print sharing is powered by the Server Message Block (SMB) protocol, which uses TCP port 445 and UDP ports 137--139. Unixes used to use their own Network File System (NFS) protocol, but they have generally settled on SMB as well. Make sure you're prepared to recognize both Common Internet File System (CIFS) and Samba as forms of SMB. CIFS is a deprecated Microsoft dialect of SMB, while Samba is the name of the Linux implementation.

On a non-NTFS volume like an optical media disc or a flash-media USB drive, you have three levels of permission when using the default Sharing Wizard: Read, Read/Write, and Owner, which are discussed later in this chapter. With Advanced Sharing (discussed in the upcoming "Sharing Folders with Advanced Sharing" section), the three permission levels are called Read, Change, and Full Control.

If you share a folder on an NTFS drive, as you normally do these days, you must set both the network permissions and the NTFS permissions to let others access your shared resources. You use the network share to share the resource but use NTFS to say what folks can do with that resource. Some good news: This is no big deal! Just set the network permissions to give everyone Full Control, and then use the NTFS permissions to exercise more precise control over who accesses the shared resources and how they access them. Open the Security tab to set the NTFS permissions. We'll get into the details a little more in the "Organizing with Workgroups" section, next.

EXAM TIP   Accessing files over a general-purpose network is convenient for humans, but the performance isn't great---many servers constantly reading and writing huge files can bring a humble SOHO network to its knees! Operations (such as data centers) that need high-performance networked storage often use a separate high-speed storage area network (SAN).

Instead of having internal hard drives, each server has access to block storage devices that live in a massive storage array. They're more or less like local storage devices to the server---it even speaks to them using iSCSI, a network protocol based on the small computer system interface (SCSI) that you encountered back in Chapter 8.

Organizing with Workgroups

Once a network is created, users need to be able to share resources in some organized fashion. Operating systems need a way to determine which users can access resources such as folders and printers and how those resources can be used. Windows networks are organized using workgroups or domains. (These are the Microsoft terms, but the concepts have been adopted by the entire computer industry and apply to macOS and other operating systems.)

Workgroups are an older, simpler approach to the network organizations---so they're a great place to start. They are also the default for almost every fresh installation of Windows.

By default, all computers on the network are assigned to a workgroup called WORKGROUP. You can see your workgroup name by opening the System applet in Control Panel, as shown in Figure 19-22.

Figure 19-22  Default workgroup

There's nothing special about the name WORKGROUP, except that every computer on the network needs the same workgroup name to be able to share resources. If you want to change your workgroup name, you need to use the System applet. In the Computer name, domain, and workgroup settings section on the right, click the Change settings link to open the System Properties dialog box. Then click the Change button to change your workgroup name (see Figure 19-23).

Figure 19-23  Changing the workgroup name in advanced settings

NOTE   If you change the workgroup name for one system, you need to change it for all other devices you want connected to that workgroup.

In macOS, you can change the workgroup name in System Preferences | Network. Click the Advanced button and then click WINS.

NOTE   Linux distros require a lot more manual configuration of both Windows machines and Linux machines to get them to play nicely on a Windows workgroup. A quick Internet search will show many step-by-step instructions for those of you interested.

Workgroups lack centralized control over the network; all systems connected to the network are equals. This works well for smaller networks because there are fewer users, connections, and security concerns to think about. But what do you do when your network encompasses dozens or hundreds of users and systems? How can you control all of that?

Usernames and Passwords

As you'll recall from Chapter 13, when you log on to a Windows computer, you need to enter a username and password. Windows makes this easy by giving you a pretty logon interface, as shown in Figure 19-24. Entering a username is identification; putting in a password that matches that username in the OS provides authentication, the process that enables a system to give a user access to system resources.

Figure 19-24  Windows logon screen

NOTE   The distinction between identification and authentication is not important for the CompTIA A+ exams, though it becomes important for Network+ and Security+. Good to learn it now!

The usernames and their passwords are stored in an encrypted format on your computer. Usernames have a number of jobs on your computer, but at this point the job most interesting to us is to give a user access to the computer. Usernames work well when you access your own computer, but these same usernames and passwords are used to access shared resources on other computers in the network---and that's where we run into trouble. Let's watch a typical folder share take place on a network of Windows systems.

Sharing Folders with the Sharing Wizard

All personal computers can share folders and printers out of the box. Sharing a folder in Windows is easy, for example, because the Sharing Wizard is enabled by default. Just right-click the folder and select Give access to | Specific people to get to the Choose people to share with dialog box (see Figure 19-25).

Figure 19-25  Folder sharing in Windows 10

By default, you'll see every user account that's currently on this system. You may give an account Read or Read/Write permission, while the person who created the folder is assigned as Owner. The following list describes these permissions:

-   Read You can see what's in the folder. You may open files in the folder, but you can't save anything back into the folder.

-   Read/Write Same as Read but you can save files into the folder.

-   Owner Same as Read/Write plus you can set the permissions for other users on the folder.

NOTE   You'll recall from Chapter 13 that all versions of Windows come with a far more powerful and much more complex form of permissions based on NTFS.

Sharing Folders with Advanced Sharing

Advanced Sharing enables you to create network shares with more precise control over access to the contents (though in practice techs tend to set everything to Full Control and let NTFS handle authorization at the local level). To create a network share, right-click the folder you want to share and select Properties. Select the Sharing tab---Figure 19-26 shows the Sharing tab for a folder called Music, where I keep high-quality files of some of my favorite albums.

Figure 19-26  Sharing tab for Music folder

Click Advanced Sharing to open the Advanced Sharing dialog box. Then click Share this folder to make it active (see Figure 19-27). Here you can set the share name---by default it's the same as the folder name, but it can be unique. You can also limit simultaneous users and add comments, among other things. Click Permissions to get to the last step (see Figure 19-28).

Figure 19-27  Advanced Sharing dialog box, ready for sharing

Figure 19-28  Permissions for the about-to-be-created network share

By default, the Everyone group is set to Read permissions, but you have options here. You can add or remove groups or usernames. Click Add to open the Select Users or Groups dialog box where you can search for users/groups currently on the local computer. (That's important to note, as you'll see in the next section, "Accessing Shared Folders with Workgroups.") Also note the other options here.

You have three permission levels---Read, Change, and Full Control---and you can set those permissions to Allow or Deny. Just like you saw with NTFS permissions, Deny always trumps Allow. Advanced Sharing gives you control over what specific user accounts and groups can do with a network share. You could grant Full Control to a user group, for example, but then add a specific user---Bob in Accounting---and Deny Full Control to that user account. That would effectively give everyone in the group (except for Bob) access to the Music share, to add, rename, delete, and so on.

EXAM TIP   Expect a question or two on the CompTIA A+ 1102 exam that requires you to compare NTFS vs. share permissions. NTFS applies superior local control over all resources on a computer. Share permissions only apply to network shares (whether created using the Sharing Wizard or Advanced Sharing). Allow vs. Deny works similarly in both types of sharing, with Deny trumping Allow.

Accessing Shared Folders with Workgroups

So all this sharing seems to work quite nicely, except for one issue: When you log on to a computer, you access a username and database on that computer. The account you access is stored on the local computer; how do you give someone from another computer access to that shared folder? You have to give that other person a valid username and password. We use the nomenclature <computer name>\<username> to track logons. If you log on to Computer A as Mike, we say you are logged on to ComputerA\Mike. This nomenclature comes in very handy when networked computers become part of the process.

Figure 19-29 shows Computers A and B. Assume there is a shared folder called Timmy on Computer A and the Mike account has Read/Write permission.

Figure 19-29  Computers A and B

A person fires up Computer B, logging on as Fred. He opens his Network menu option and sees Computer A, but when he clicks on it he sees a network password prompt (see Figure 19-30).

Figure 19-30  Prompt for entering username and password

The reason is that the person is logged on as ComputerB\Fred and he needs to be logged on as ComputerA\Mike to successfully access this folder. So the user needs to know the password for ComputerA\Mike. This isn't a very pretty way to protect usernames and passwords. So what can you do? You have three choices:

1\.   You can make people log on to shares as just shown.

2\.   You can create the same accounts (same username and same password) on all the computers and give sharing permissions to all the users for all the shares.

3\.   You can use one account on all computers. Everyone logs on with the same account, and then all shares are by default assigned to the same account.

EXAM TIP   Moving and copying folders and files within network shares and between network shares and local computers doesn't affect the file attributes. If you copy a read-only file from a network share to your desktop, for example, it'll still be read-only. You can easily change this sort of file attribute by right-clicking the file and selecting Properties.

Organizing with Domains

Workgroups work well in smaller networks (<30 computers), but for larger networks, or if you desire a network with more control and security, it's far better to use a Windows domain---a network organization that centralizes user accounts, passwords, and access to resources. Look at Figures 19-31 and 19-32. In a Windows workgroup, each computer has its own set of local user accounts. In a Windows domain, a computer running Windows Server is configured as a domain controller. A domain controller stores a set of domain accounts. A user logging on to any computer on the domain may use their one domain account to log on to the entire network.

Figure 19-31  Workgroup

Figure 19-32  Domain

NOTE   Even though a computer is on a domain, you can still log on using a local user account, though this is rarely needed. You'll only see this happen with troubleshooting scenarios, like when we rebuilt corrupted profiles in Chapter 16. Otherwise, once you're a member of a domain, you'll log in with your domain account.

A Windows domain (which is not the same as a domain in DNS) makes it easy for anyone with a domain account to log on to any computer in the domain with a single account, a process called single sign-on (SSO). Each user does not need a separate local account stored on every computer. User authentication through the single domain account enables access to all machines on the domain, thus the term single sign-on.

If you have a single computer storing all the domain usernames and passwords, why not take it one step higher and store information about the domain, including printer information, computer names, location information---anything you might need to define the entire network. Modern versions of Windows use an Active Directory domain to accomplish these tasks.

EXAM TIP   Active Directory is powered by the Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP), which uses TCP port 389. LDAP generally stays out of sight---but it does important work to keep AD networks running smoothly. It also powers open-source Active Directory alternatives such as OpenLDAP.

To use a domain on a network of Windows machines, for example, you must have a computer running a version of Windows Server (see Figure 19-33) or Linux running Samba. Windows Server is a completely different, much more powerful, and much more expensive version of Windows. You then need to promote the server to a domain controller. This creates the Active Directory.

Figure 19-33  Windows Server running in command line only core mode

EXAM TIP   Look for a comparison question on the CompTIA A+ 1102 exam on workgroup vs. domain network setup. The former takes no effort; the latter requires joining an Active Directory domain.

Once a server is set up as a domain controller, creating the Active Directory, each PC on the network needs to join the domain (which kicks you off the workgroup). When you log on to a computer that's a member of a domain, Windows will prompt you for a username instead of showing you icons for all the users on the network (see Figure 19-34).

Figure 19-34  Domain logon screen

When using Active Directory, you don't log on to your computer. Instead, you log on directly to the domain. All user accounts are stored on the domain controller, as shown in Figure 19-35. A lot of domains have names that look like Web addresses, like home.totalsem.com or totalhome.local. Using the previous nomenclature, you can log on to a domain using <domain>\<domain username>. If the domain totalhome.local has a user account called Mike, for example, you would use totalhome.local\Mike to log on.

Figure 19-35  Active Directory network

Domain Organization

Active Directory stores everything about a network. One way to see the Active Directory is to log on directly to the domain controller and run the Active Directory Users and Computers utility---the tool that provides basic Active Directory functions (see Figure 19-36). Note the name of the domain (in this case totalhome.local) on the left side. The folders underneath the domain name show the domain's organization. Those really aren't folders. They're called organizational units (even though they look like folders), but we'll save that definition for a moment. Here are a few of the more noteworthy folders.

Figure 19-36  Active Directory Users and Computers

-   Builtin This is where all the built-in domain groups are stored, such as Domain Administrators and Users.

-   Computers Every system, from servers to workstations, is listed in this folder.

-   Domain Controllers It's always a good idea to have more than one domain controller in case one goes down. This folder lists all of them.

-   Users This area stores all the non-built-in users for the domain.

Domain Administration

Just as individual systems have an administrator account, the domain also has domain administrators. The accounts are extremely powerful and enable you to join a computer to a domain. Certain domain jobs require domain admin rights. Here's how to deal with adding and removing computers and users from a domain.

To have a computer join a domain, on the Start screen type Control Panel and then press ENTER. Then proceed to System and Security and click System. Under Computer name, domain, and workgroup settings, click Change settings. To change the Computer name, click Change. Under Member of, click Domain, and then type the name of the domain that you want the computer to join, and then press OK. At this point, you will need to restart the computer (see Figure 19-37). Make sure you have access to a Domain account that can join the domain!

Figure 19-37  Joining a domain

Removing a system from a domain just means accessing the domain controller, going into Active Directory Users and Computers, and right-clicking the computer in question and choosing Properties. Select the Member Of tab, select the unwanted computer, and click the Remove button to remove the computer (see Figure 19-38).

Figure 19-38  Removing a computer from the domain

There's no way to promote a local user or group to a domain user or group. A domain admin must create a fresh new domain account on the domain controller using Active Directory Users and Computers. Right-click Users and select New | User (see Figure 19-39) to open the New Object - User dialog box. Figure 19-40 show the dialog box with user account information filled in.

Figure 19-39  Users context menu options

Figure 19-40  Adding a new domain account

EXAM TIP   Groups (or, more accurately, security groups) in Active Directory are more or less the same concept as the user groups you encountered in Chapter 13---though Active Directory centralizes them (and can do much more with them).

Domain administrators use the Active Directory Users and Computers utility to clean up account issues. To reset a password, right-click a user account and select Reset Password . . . to open the Reset Password dialog box (see Figure 19-41). Type in a new password, confirm it, and click OK. From the same dialog box, you can select the checkbox to Unlock the user's account if needed, such as in the case of accidental, multiple mistyped logon attempts. Finally, you can enable or disable a user account from the context menu by selecting---you guessed it---Enable Account or Disable Account.

Figure 19-41  Reset Password dialog box

There's a lot of power in a domain account, allowing features you rarely see in a local account. For example, you can add a logon script that runs every time the user logs in that can map network drives, place an information box on the screen, run applications (like anti-malware)---pretty much anything you wish to do. Just add the path and name of the script file under the Profile tab (see Figure 19-42). (Note that CompTIA calls a logon script a login script. It's the same thing.)

Figure 19-42  Adding a logon script to a domain account

Another great feature built into Active Directory is the ability to pick where you want to store users' home folders (such as Pictures, Downloads, Documents, etc.). This requires the use of roaming profiles rather than local profiles. Let me explain. Every time you log on to a computer that's new to your user account, Windows will set up a new home folder for your domain account on that local machine. It won't be populated with any of your stuff, though, because it's a new home folder.

This creates some frustration because users might want to have only one Documents folder, one Downloads folder, one Pictures folder . . . in other words, a single unified home folder. To accomplish this "oneness," administrators set up roaming profiles on the server. When a user logs on to the domain, the roaming profile applies and the user can access his or her files.

Additionally, administrators can specify the location of users' home folders, so that when users log on, they access home folders on a remote server rather than the local machine. This process, called folder redirection, helps administrators keep tighter control over network resources.

Just to be clear, administrators handle the processes involved in setting up roaming profiles and folder redirection (and many other cool Active Directory features). CompTIA A+ techs need to know that these features exist so they're not surprised in the field.

Active Directory enables extremely flexible organization of Active Directory users and computers via the use of organizational units (OUs) that enable you to organize users and computers by function, location, permission . . . Whatever makes sense for your organization, you can use OUs to manage those assets.

Figure 19-43 shows an example of a heavily modified Active Directory for the totalhome.local domain. Note the OUs for different locations, inactive accounts, and even printers.

Figure 19-43  totalhome.local domain

EXAM TIP   The domain controller authenticates a user when that user logs on to a domain computer. The domain controller is therefore also called an authentication server.

File Servers and Drive Mapping

Sharing individual files and folders that are located on user systems may be all users need to collaborate occasionally, but dedicated file servers are the way to go when many users need round-the-clock access to a single authoritative copy of important files. When users only need access occasionally, they can just directly access the file server (likely after authenticating), but it's often easier for Windows users that need to interact with a file server constantly to map an unused drive letter to a folder on the file server.

Here's how to manually configure a mapped drive in Windows. In Windows 11, open File Explorer, click the See More menu, and choose Map network drive. In Windows 10, open File Explorer, click This PC on the left-hand side of the screen, and click Map network drive. In the Map Network Drive dialog box, select the drive letter you want from the drop-down menu, then click Browse and navigate to the folder you'd like to map (as shown in Figure 19-44). You can also choose in the Map Network Drive dialog box whether the drive will be mapped on sign-in and whether it requires different credentials.

Figure 19-44  Setting up a mapped network drive

NOTE   In an Active Directory domain, network shares may be automatically mapped by Group Policy or login scripts. In that case, you'd need to ensure the user is a member of the right group or attach a login script to the user's account. You can learn more about Group Policy in Chapter 27.

Sharing Printers

Sharing printers in Windows follows the same process as sharing files and folders. Assuming that the system has printer sharing services loaded, go to the Devices and Printers settings in the Control Panel and right-click the name of the printer you wish to share. Select Printer properties (not Printers), and then select the Sharing tab (see Figure 19-45). Click Share this printer, add a share name, click OK or Apply, and you're done.

Figure 19-45  Giving a name to a shared printer on Windows 10

NOTE   To learn about accessing shared printers in Windows, check out Chapter 26.

One of the most pleasant aspects of configuring a system for networking under all versions of Microsoft Windows is the amazing amount of the process that is automated. For example, if Windows detects a NIC in a system, it automatically installs the NIC driver, a network protocol (TCP/IP), and Client for Microsoft Networks. So if you want to share a resource, everything you need is automatically installed. Note that although File and Printer Sharing is also automatically installed, you still must activate it by checking the appropriate checkbox in the Local Area Connection Properties dialog box.

Troubleshooting Networks

Once you go beyond a single PC and enter the realm of networked computers, your troubleshooting skills need to take a giant leap up in quality. The secret to finding the right answer to networking problems on the CompTIA A+ exams is to remember that the exams only ask about the skills to get a single computer back on the network. Focus your network troubleshooting answers to scenario questions on getting a single system up and running.

NOTE   The troubleshooting issues discussed here apply only to a LAN, and do not cover issues related to troubleshooting Internet access. We'll cover Internet troubleshooting in Chapter 21, using the knowledge you've gained in this chapter and adding even more tools.

CompTIA likes to ask scenario questions that deal with "no connectivity" or "intermittent connectivity." Let's consider two types of connectivity problem: when a computer loses physical connectivity, and when a computer is on the network but can't access a specific resource.

Repairing Physical Cabling

"The network's down!" is one of the most terrifying phrases a network tech will ever hear. Networks fail for many reasons, and the first thing to know is that good-quality, professionally installed cabling rarely goes bad, but you need to know what to do when it does. Let's take a moment now to discuss what to do when you think you've got a problem with your physical network.

Symptoms

Physical connectivity interruptions stand out in Windows. Windows displays a circle-backslash symbol over a globe icon in the notification area to show you're not connected (see Figure 19-46).

Figure 19-46  Windows no Internet notification icon

If you encounter this problem, first check the obvious. Run ipconfig from the command line. Do you see an APIPA/zeroconf address, like 169.254.15.22? That's a clear sign of a disconnect between the system and the DHCP server. Is the cable unplugged at the system? At the wall outlet? Then go for the less obvious: Is the NIC disabled in Device Manager? If these checks don't solve the problem, take a peek on the other side of the cable. If you're not connected to a running switch, you're going to get the disconnect errors.

EXAM TIP   If you're in macOS or Linux, you can run the ifconfig command or ip command to get the same information that ipconfig gives you in Windows.

Intermittent connectivity is often the same issue but typically is harder to figure out. Either way, read the next section to see how to get serious about testing for these pesky connectivity problems.

Diagnosing Physical Problems

Look for errors that point to physical disconnection. A key clue that the computer may have a physical problem is that a user gets a "No server is found" error, or tries to use the operating system's network explorer utility (like Network in Windows) and doesn't see any systems besides his or her own.

Multiple systems failing to access the network often points to hardware problems. This is where knowledge of your network cabling helps. If all the systems connected to one switch suddenly no longer see the network, but all the other systems in your network still function, you not only have a probable hardware problem, but also have a suspect---the switch.

Check the Lights

If you suspect a hardware problem, first check the link lights on the NIC and switch. If they're not lit, you know the cable isn't connected somewhere. If you're not physically at the system in question (if you're on a tech call, for example), you can have the user check his or her connection status through the link lights or through software.

EXAM TIP   The CompTIA A+ 1101 objectives mention a problem where the link lights might mislead you. The lights may go off and come back on if you're dealing with port flapping---when a connection on a switch or NIC port repeatedly goes up or down---but you may still need to replace the cable, NIC, or switch (or avoid the bad port). It's easier to spot port flapping in the logs on your network devices, but if you start to suspect flapping or notice the link lights cycle off, check for physical problems with the cable, NIC, and switch.

If the problem system clearly cannot connect, eliminate the possibility of a failed switch or other larger problem by checking to make sure other people can access the network, and that other systems can access the shared resource (server) that the problem system can't see. Inspect the cable running from the back of the computer to the outlet. Finally, if you can, plug the system into a known-good outlet and see if it works. A veteran network tech keeps a long patch cable for just this purpose. If you get connectivity with the second outlet, you should begin to suspect the structured cable running from the first outlet to the switch. Assuming the cable is installed properly and has been working correctly before this event, a simple continuity test will confirm your suspicion in most cases.

Check the NIC

Be warned that a bad NIC can also generate a "can't see the network" problem. Use the utility provided by the OS to verify that the NIC works. If you've got a NIC with diagnostic software, run it---this software will check the NIC's circuitry. The NIC's female connector is a common failure point, so NICs that come with diagnostic software often include a special test called a loopback test. A loopback test sends data out of the NIC and checks to see if it comes back. Some NICs perform only an internal loopback, which tests the circuitry that sends and receives, but not the actual connecting pins. A true external loopback requires a loopback plug inserted into the NIC's port (see Figure 19-47). If a NIC is bad, replace it.

Figure 19-47  Loopback plug

NOTE   Onboard NICs on laptops are especially notorious for breaking due to frequent plugging and unplugging. On some laptops, the NICs are easy to replace; others require a motherboard replacement. Or you can always use a USB-to-Ethernet adapter.

Cable Testing

The vast majority of network disconnection problems occur at the work area. If you've tested those connections, though, and the work area seems fine, it's time to consider deeper issues.

With the right equipment, diagnosing a bad horizontal cabling run is easy. Anyone running a professional network should own a midrange time-domain reflectometer (TDR) tester such as the Fluke MicroScanner. A TDR sends a signal down the cable, and any sudden change in impedance will cause some of that signal to reflect back. The TDR can then time this reflection and calculate how far down the cable a break is or the total length of a working cable. With a little practice, you can easily determine not only whether a cable is disconnected but also where the disconnection takes place. Sometimes patience is required, especially if the cable runs lack labels, but you will find the problem.

When you're testing a cable run, always include the patch cables as you test. This means unplugging the patch cable from the PC, attaching a tester, and then going to the telecommunications room. Here you'll want to unplug the patch cable from the switch and plug the tester into that patch cable, making a complete test, as shown in Figure 19-48.

Figure 19-48  Cable tester in action

Testing in this manner gives you a complete test from the switch to the system. In general, a broken cable must be replaced. A bad patch cable is an easy fix, but what happens if the horizontal cable is to blame? In these cases, I get on the phone and call my local installer. If a cable is bad in one spot, the risk of it being bad in another is simply too great to try anything other than total replacement.

Toners

It would be nice to say that all cable installations are perfect and that over the years they won't tend to grow into horrific piles of spaghetti-like, unlabeled cables. In the real world, though, you might eventually find yourself having to locate or trace cables. Even in the best-planned networks, labels fall off ports and outlets, mystery cables appear behind walls, new cable runs are added, and mistakes are made counting rows and columns on patch panels. Sooner or later, most network techs will have to be able to pick out one particular cable or port from a stack.

When the time comes to trace cables, network techs turn to a device called a toner for help. Toner is the generic term for two separate devices that are used together: a tone generator and a tone probe. The tone generator connects to the cable using alligator clips, tiny hooks, or a network jack, and it sends an electrical signal along the wire at a certain frequency. The tone probe emits a sound when it is placed near a cable connected to the tone generator. These two devices are sometimes referred to by the brand name Fox and Hound, a model of toner made by the Triplett Corporation (see Figure 19-49).

Figure 19-49  Well used Fox and Hound

EXAM TIP   You'll see a tone probe referred to on the CompTIA A+ exam as a toner probe.

To trace a cable, connect the tone generator to the known end of the cable in question, and then position the tone probe next to the other end of each of the cables that might be the right one. The tone probe makes a sound when it's placed next to the right cable. Some toners have one tone probe that works with multiple tone generators. Each generator emits a separate frequency, and the probe sounds a different tone for each one. Even good toners are relatively inexpensive ($100 or so); although inexpensive toners can cost less than $25, they don't tend to work well, so spending a little more is worthwhile. Just keep in mind that if you have to support a network, you'd do best to own a decent toner.

Fixing Common Problems

Let's go back and look at the second possible meaning for a loss in connectivity. It's very common to try to connect to a shared resource and either fail or find that a shared resource you've used time and again has suddenly disappeared. This applies (in this chapter, at least) to local resources---shares on the LAN, shared printers, e-mail server, and so on. Troubleshooting access to unavailable resources is part of a tech's bread-and-butter job.

Failing to Connect to a New Resource

When you can't connect to a resource on the first try, it often points to a configuration issue. In most cases, a quick double-check of the sharing system will reveal one of the following problems (and call for the associated solution):

-   You don't have the right share name? Go check at the serving system.

-   You don't have the required username/password? Ask someone who might have this knowledge, or double-check that your account has access.

-   You don't have permission to use/access/connect to the shared resource? Make sure you have the correct permissions.

-   You may need a forced Group Policy update if you're in an Active Directory domain. Group Policy updates may take a little while to propagate. The gpresult and gpupdate commands we took a look at in Chapter 15 can help you view the active policy settings and force an update if necessary.

-   The folder or printer isn't shared? Share it!

-   The folder or printer doesn't exist? Make sure the serving system still hosts the folder you want. Install the network printer if you haven't yet.

Failing to Connect to a Previously Used Resource

If you suddenly can't connect to a resource that you've used many times before, go with the easy answers first:

-   Check that you can see the resource using Network.

-   Check that the serving system is on.

-   Check that the computer is physically connected to the serving system.

The net Command

Windows enables you to view a network quickly from the command line through the net command. This works great when you plug into a network for the first time and, naturally, don't know the names of the other computers on that network. To see the many options that net offers, type net at a command prompt and press ENTER. The view and use options offer excellent network tools.

You can think of net view as the command-line version of Network. When run, net view returns a list of Windows computers on the network:

EXAM TIP   \\SABERTOOTH and the other server names here are examples of network paths---more technically called Universal Naming Convention (UNC) paths. The CompTIA A+ 1102 objectives want you to know that you can use File Explorer to work with these network paths in Windows. It works both ways. If you navigate the network with File Explorer, you can use it to copy out a network path. If you already have a network path and need to see if it's accessible, type or paste it in File Explorer's address bar!

Once you know the names of the computers, you type net view followed by the computer name. The net view command will show any shares on that machine and whether they are mapped drives:

The net use command is a command-line method for mapping network shares. For example, if you wanted to map the Research share shown in the previous example to the X: drive, you simply run

C:\>net use x: \\server1\research

This will map drive X: to the Research share on the SERVER1 computer. Mapping a drive means the drive will show up in File Explorer as a selectable resource, just like a local drive.

NOTE   The net command can give a quick snapshot of the Windows network settings, such as computer name, OS version, workgroup or domain name, and more. Run

net config workstation

It's quick and easy!

The nbtstat Command

The nbtstat command is an old command-line utility that predates Windows. It stands for NetBIOS over TCP/IP Statistics. Many versions ago, Windows used NetBIOS for many aspects of LAN file sharing, and even though NetBIOS is long gone, bits of NetBIOS hang on as a way for Windows to resolve host names on the network when a DNS server is not available.

While not covered on the CompTIA A+ Exam, nbtstat can still provide insight when troubleshooting naming issues in small workgroups. Here are a couple of usage examples; to see what your computer's NetBIOS name is, use the nbtstat -n command:

You can also query a remote machine by IP to find out its NetBIOS name with nbtstat -A (note the uppercase "A"; use a lowercase "a" if you know the machine's NetBIOS name already):

Finally, you can see all the names that NetBIOS has in its local cache with nbtstat -c:

Because the cache is temporary, you may find that it is empty if you haven't browsed your LAN or interacted with another machine recently.

CHAPTER 20

Wireless Networking

In this chapter, you will learn how to

-   Describe wireless networking components

-   Analyze and explain wireless networking standards

-   Install and configure wireless networks

-   Troubleshoot wireless networks

Wireless networks have been popular for many years now, but unlike wired networks, so much of how wireless works continues to elude people. Part of the problem might be that a simple wireless network is so inexpensive and easy to configure that most users and techs never really get into the hows of wireless. The chance to get away from all the cables and mess and just connect has a phenomenal appeal. The lack of understanding, though, hurts techs when it comes time to troubleshoot wireless networks. Let's change all that and dive deeply into wireless networking.

Historical/Conceptual

Wireless Networking Components

Instead of a physical set of wires running between network nodes, wireless networks use radio waves to communicate. Various kinds of wireless networking solutions have come and gone in the past (including some that used light instead of radio waves), but most of the wireless networks you'll find yourself supporting these days are wireless LANs (WLANs) based on the IEEE 802.11 wireless Ethernet standard---marketed as Wi-Fi---and on Bluetooth technology.

EXAM TIP   One big difference between LANs and WLANs is security. In a LAN, you can disable ports and limit access to make it hard to sniff your traffic. In a WLAN, all of your packets are zooming through the air and require completely different security mechanisms. Another is that WLANs are a shared medium just like old hub-based LANs---the process of communicating over a WLAN is a complex dance with rules to keep devices from talking over each other.

Wireless networking capabilities of one form or another are built into many modern computing devices. Wi-Fi and Bluetooth capabilities are now common as integrated components, and you can easily add them when they aren't. Figure 20-1 shows a PCIe Wi-Fi adapter. You can also add wireless network capabilities by using external USB wireless network adapters or wireless NICs, as shown in Figure 20-2.

Figure 20-1  Wireless PCIe add-on card

Figure 20-2  External USB wireless NIC

Wireless networking is not limited to PCs. Most smartphones and tablets have wireless capabilities built in or available as add-on options. Figure 20-3 shows a smartphone accessing the Internet over a Wi-Fi connection.

Figure 20-3  Smartphone with wireless capability

NOTE   See Chapter 24 for the scoop on mobile devices like smartphones and tablets.

1101

To extend the capabilities of a wireless Ethernet network, such as connecting to a wired network or sharing a high-speed Internet connection, you need a wireless access point (WAP). A WAP centrally connects wireless network devices in the same way that a hub connects wired Ethernet devices. Many WAPs also act as switches and Internet routers, such as the ASUS device shown in Figure 20-4.

Figure 20-4  ASUS device that acts as wireless access point, switch, and router

Like any other electronic devices, most WAPs draw their power from a wall outlet. More advanced WAPs, especially those used in corporate settings, can also use a feature called Power over Ethernet (PoE). Using PoE, you only need to plug a single Ethernet cable into the WAP to provide it with both power and a network connection. The power and network connection are both supplied by a PoE-capable switch.

EXAM TIP   The CompTIA A+ 1101 exam objectives mention PoE standards. These include IEEE 802.3af, IEEE 802.3at, and IEEE 802.3bt (which are often marketed respectively as PoE, PoE+, and PoE++). Make sure you recognize them! PoE can power more than just WAPs---and it's especially helpful for devices that are rarely located near power outlets. A Power over Ethernet injector, for example, can extend a PoE connection up to 100 meters to connect Ethernet devices such as security cameras.

Wireless communication via Bluetooth comes as a built-in option on newer computers and peripheral devices, or you can add it to an older PC via an external USB Bluetooth adapter. All macOS devices---desktop and portable---have Bluetooth. Most commonly these days, you'll see Bluetooth used to connect a portable speaker to a smartphone, for music on the go, and to connect keyboards to tablets. Figure 20-5 shows a Bluetooth keyboard paired with a Bluetooth-enabled Apple iPad.

Figure 20-5  Bluetooth keyboard and tablet

NOTE   Wireless access points are commonly known as WAPs, APs, or access points.

Wireless Networking Software

Wireless devices use the same networking protocols and client that their wired counterparts use, and they operate by using the carrier sense multiple access/collision avoidance (CSMA/CA) networking scheme. The collision avoidance aspect differs slightly from the collision detection standard used in wired Ethernet. A wireless device listens in on the wireless medium to see if another is currently broadcasting data. If so, it waits a random amount of time before retrying. So far, this method is exactly the same as the method used by wired Ethernet networks. Because wireless devices have a more difficult time detecting data collisions, however, they offer the option of using the Request to Send/Clear to Send (RTS/CTS) protocol. With this protocol enabled, a transmitting device sends an RTS frame to the receiving device after it determines the wireless medium is clear to use. The receiver responds with a CTS frame, telling the sender that it's okay to transmit. Then, once the data is sent, the transmitting device waits for an acknowledgment (ACK) from the receiving device before sending the next data packet. This option is very elegant, but keep in mind that using RTS/CTS introduces significant overhead to the process and can impede performance.

In terms of configuring wireless networking software, you need to do very little. Wireless network adapters are plug and play, so any modern version of Windows or macOS immediately recognizes one when it is installed, prompting you to load any needed hardware drivers. You will, however, need a utility to set parameters such as the network name. Modern operating systems include built-in tools for configuring these settings (see Figure 20-6).

Figure 20-6  Wireless configuration utility in macOS

Wireless Infrastructure

Wireless networks use one or more WAPs to connect the wireless network devices to a wired network segment, as shown in Figure 20-7. A single WAP servicing a given area is called a Basic Service Set (BSS). This service area can be extended by adding more WAPs.

Figure 20-7  Wireless network with a single WAP

Larger homes, office buildings, and campuses are a whole different beast. They may have more than one WAP wired up to provide good signal coverage throughout the organization. This is called, appropriately, an Extended Basic Service Set (EBSS). They may also lean on devices known as wireless repeaters/extenders that rebroadcast signals from clients and WAPs to help cover dead zones. Organizations can also "wirelessly wire" buildings up to several miles away. Long-range fixed wireless, which uses directional antennas, is a great way to interconnect remote buildings when it's hard or impractical to physically run cable to them.

Many manufacturers also produce sets of Wi-Fi components (each is a bit like a WAP and a bit like an extender) that collaborate to form a mesh network---with one of these devices serving as the gateway. The key characteristic of a wireless mesh network (WMN) is that the mesh devices act like routers, forwarding traffic for each other. These little mesh networks can improve signal coverage in a house or business that a single router or WAP has trouble covering---with less hassle than if you added more WAPs or extenders.

1102

Wireless Networking Security

One of the classic complaints against wireless networking is that it offers weak security. After all, data packets are floating through the air instead of safely wrapped up inside network cabling---what's to stop an unscrupulous person with the right equipment from grabbing those packets out of the air and reading that data? We have come a long way since the early days of Wi-Fi. In the past, you could access a wireless network by walking into a WAP's coverage area, turning on a wireless device, and connecting. These days, it has grown hard to find accidentally open networks, as hardware makers have trended toward using some type of security by default. Still, issues with these well-intentioned defaults are common, so it's still important to review the settings on new equipment.

Wireless networks use three methods to secure access to the network itself and secure the data being transferred: MAC address filtering, authentication, and data encryption. But before anyone encounters the on-network security, there are some measures we can take to reduce the likelihood our network will be targeted in the first place. Let's take a look at these practices first, followed by the methods for securing the network itself.

SSID

The service set identifier (SSID) parameter---also called the network name---defines the wireless network. Wireless devices want to be heard, and WAPs are usually configured to announce their presence by broadcasting the SSID to their maximum range. This is very handy when you have several wireless networks in the same area, but a default SSID also gives away important clues about the manufacturer (and maybe even model) of an access point.

Always change the default SSID to something unique and change the password right away. Configuring a unique SSID name and password is the very least that you should do to secure a wireless network. Older default SSID names and passwords are well known and widely available online. While newer models may come with unique SSIDs and passwords, the SSID may still leak information about your hardware---and the generated password may use rules that make it easy to break.

These defaults are intended to make setting up a wireless network as easy as possible but can cause problems in places with a lot of overlapping wireless networks. Keep in mind that each wireless access point in a network needs to be configured with the same unique SSID name. This SSID name is then included in the header of every data packet broadcast in the wireless network's coverage area. Data packets that lack the correct SSID name in the header are rejected. When it comes to picking a new unique SSID, it's still good to think about whether the name will make your network a more interesting target or give away details that could help an attacker gain physical or remote access.

Another trick often seen in wireless networks is to tell the WAP not to broadcast the SSID. In theory, people not authorized to access the network will have a harder time knowing it's there, as it won't show up in the list of nearby networks on most devices.

In practice, even simple wireless scanning programs can discover the name of an "unknown" wireless network. Disabling the SSID broadcast just makes it harder for legitimate clients to connect. It doesn't stop bad actors at all---except on a CompTIA A+ exam question.

EXAM TIP   Two of the wireless-specific "security settings" called out in the CompTIA A+ 1102 objectives leave me scratching my head: disabling SSID broadcast and changing channels. Disabling SSID broadcast just makes it harder for legitimate users to find your network; even a simple wireless scanner will still see your network---and no serious attacker will be fooled. Channel selection has nothing to do with security---though it can impact performance. Modern WAPs will generally auto-select channels based on interference, but if not you should do the same manually. Neither of these practices will secure your network---but don't be shocked if they turn up as the right answer on the exam.

Access Point Placement and Radio Power

When setting up a wireless network, keep the space in mind; you can limit risk by hiding the network from outsiders. When using an omni-directional antenna that sends and receives signals in all directions, for example, keep it near the center of the home or office. The closer you place it to a wall, the further away someone outside the home or office can be and still detect the wireless network.

Many wireless access points enable you to adjust the radio power levels of the antenna. Decrease the radio power until you can get reception at the furthest point inside the target network space, but not outside. This will take some trial and error.

EXAM TIP   Don't forget to make sure the WAP is also in a physically secure location. Most WAPs have physical Ethernet ports in addition to their wireless capabilities. These ports are not password-protected or encrypted. Keep the WAP in a location where unscrupulous folks can't get to it.

Guest Networks

Some WAPs include a guest access feature that makes it easier to set up a network for untrusted users. The CompTIA A+ 1102 objectives mention disabling guest access as a wireless-specific security measure---so be prepared to recognize it as a security measure on the exam. In the real world, be conservative: disable guest access unless you need it. The specifics of this mode can differ, so look into how your device handles guest access if you know you'll need it---and consider an upgrade if you don't like what you discover.

Some devices (especially those designed with businesses like bars, cafes, and coffee shops in mind) have a pretty secure guest mode where guests have access to their own SSID---protected with a different password---and you can prevent them from communicating with each other and the rest of your network. Once again, be conservative: if you need guest networks, enable these protections unless you have a specific reason to let guests interact with each other or the rest of your network.

MAC Address Filtering

Most WAPs support MAC address filtering, a method that enables you to limit access to your wireless network based on the physical, hard-wired address of the units' wireless NIC. MAC address filtering is a handy way of creating a type of "accepted users" list to limit access to your wireless network, but it works best when you have a small number of users. A table stored in the WAP lists the MAC addresses that are permitted to participate in the wireless network. Any data packets that don't contain a MAC address listed in the table are rejected.

NOTE   MAC filtering might sound airtight, but it isn't. An attacker can use software to listen for the MAC addresses of nearby clients and spoof the address of an accepted client.

Wireless Security Protocols and Authentication Methods

Wireless security protocols provide authentication and encryption to lock down wireless networks. Wireless networks offer awesome connectivity options, but equally provide tempting targets. Wireless developers have worked very hard to provide techs the tools for protecting wireless clients and communication. Wireless authentication accomplishes the same thing wired authentication does, enabling the system to check a user's credentials and give or deny him or her access to the network. Encryption scrambles the signals on radio waves and makes communication among users secure.

This section looks at the most recent generations of wireless security protocols, WPA2 and WPA3, as well as typical authentication methods. (See "Wi-Fi Configuration" later in this chapter for the scoop on enterprise authentication installations.)

EXAM TIP   Wireless networks have already been with us for a long time---and the early attempts to secure them were a little...haphazard. These days, Wired Equivalent Privacy (WEP) and the original Wi-Fi Protected Access (WPA) are both deprecated. If you see them on the exam, they're probably wrong answers. If you encounter WEP or WPA on real-world devices where they are the best security available---it's time to go shopping! Wi-Fi Protected Setup (WPS) is also deprecated---but you may still see it on newer devices since it enables less-technical users to add devices to their network by first pressing a button on their WAP.

WPA2  Wi-Fi Protected Access 2 (WPA2) uses the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) to provide a secure wireless environment. All current WAPs and wireless clients support WPA2. You may encounter older routers with a "backward compatible" mode for first-generation WPA---but at this point I recommend upgrading or replacing WPA-only devices if at all possible.

EXAM TIP   WPA2 is also compatible with the Temporal Key Integrity Protocol (TKIP), an older encryption method that was introduced with the original WPA. You may see it as an option (both on the exam and in WPA2 devices), but---as an option for backward compatibility with even older devices---enabling it will make a modern network less secure (and potentially slow it down).

WPA3  The successor to WPA2 was announced in early 2018. Wi-Fi Protected Access 3 (WPA3) addresses some security and usability issues, including encryption to protect the data of users on open (public) networks.

NOTE   WPA2 was the best option we had for well over a decade. The transition to WPA3 is under way, but WAPs tend to have a pretty long life---expect WPA2 to be the best option on many older devices. Implement WPA3 networks when practical, and eventually disable WPA2 once all of the devices you need to support are WPA3-compatible.

Wireless Networking Standards and Regulations

Most wireless networks use radio frequency (RF) technologies, in particular the 802.11 (Wi-Fi) standards. (Other standards such as Bluetooth hold a much smaller place in today's market.) These technologies use parts of the RF signal spectrum that were already in use for other purposes, so they are tightly regulated to minimize their impact on those users. To help you gain a better understanding of wireless network technologies, this section provides a brief look at the standards they use and some aspects of how regulations come into play.

NOTE   Radio frequency is the part of the electromagnetic spectrum used for radio communication.

IEEE 802.11-Based Wireless Networking

The IEEE 802.11 wireless Ethernet standard, more commonly known as Wi-Fi, defines methods devices may use to communicate via spread-spectrum radio waves. Spread-spectrum broadcasts data in small, discrete chunks over the frequencies available within a certain frequency range.

NOTE   Wi-Fi and other wireless communication technologies use radio frequencies that fall in industrial, scientific, and medical (ISM) radio bands. This can lead to interference with other devices such as microwave ovens and baby monitors.

The 802.11-based wireless technologies broadcast and receive on one of three radio bands: 2.4 GHz, 5 GHz, and 6 GHz. A band is a contiguous range of frequencies that is usually divided up into discrete slices called channels. Over the years, the original 802.11 standard has been extended to 802.11a, 802.11b, 802.11g, 802.11n, 802.11ac, and 802.11ax variations used in Wi-Fi wireless networks. Each of these versions of 802.11 uses one of the two bands, with the exception of 802.11n, which uses one but may use both. Don't worry; I'll break this down for you in a moment.

Newer wireless devices typically provide backward compatibility with older wireless devices. If you are using an 802.11n WAP, all of your 802.11g devices can use it. An 802.11ac WAP is backward compatible with 802.11b, g, and n. The exception to this is 802.11a, which requires a 5-GHz radio, meaning only 802.11ac and dual-band 802.11n WAPs are backward compatible with 802.11a devices. The following paragraphs describe the important specifications of each of the popular 802.11-based wireless networking standards. Let's take a look at Wi-Fi Channels first.

Understanding Wi-Fi Channels

Here's the simple part: each Wi-Fi channel is a little 20-MHz slice of its broader radio band. Unfortunately, you still need to know a good bit more about what channels are, and how they operate to configure and manage modern Wi-Fi networks. One of the big reasons for this is that channels are a little bit different between the 2.4-GHz, 5-GHz, and 6-GHz bands---and different countries regulate them differently.

2.4 GHz  In the 2.4-GHz band, most countries allow for either 11 or 13 channels, with a big catch---they overlap! Overlapping channels are not so great for performance, so in the United States we're left with three nonoverlapping channels: 1, 6, and 11. We're also at the mercy of other nearby networks. If your weird neighbor chooses a weird channel---maybe their favorite number is 8---they can make it harder for everyone else. Be a good neighbor---pick 1, 6, or 11!

5 GHz  Thankfully, channels in the 5-GHz band are nonoverlapping. The big catch here, though, is that the number of available channels and the exact ones that are available can differ from country to country. In the United States, we have 25 channels to choose from. You can also (depending on the Wi-Fi standard) "bond" two or four channels into a wide (40 MHz) or ultra-wide (80 MHz) channel, increasing throughput at the expense of making your network more vulnerable to interference. At least for now, 5 GHz is the preferred band---use it if you can!

NOTE   Technically, you can use 40-MHz channels in the 2.4-GHz band, but they may hurt your performance. I don't recommend it.

6 GHz  As of this writing, the 6-GHz band is already available for Wi-Fi 6E devices in some countries (including the United States) and is working its way through the regulatory process in others. Its main promise is, of course, less congestion. The new band significantly increases the space available for Wi-Fi networks, giving us many more nonoverlapping channels to spread out over. It's so much more room, in fact, that it can support bonding eight channels into one super-wide (160 MHz) channel.

NOTE   The 6-GHz band has its own catches. For example, some people already have licenses for parts of the 6-GHz spectrum, and Wi-Fi devices aren't allowed to interfere with them. For now, this means it's easiest to use the 6-GHz band indoors on devices that have limited power and nonremovable antennas. WAPs designed for use outdoors must support Automated Frequency Coordination (AFC), a technology with which the WAP sends its location, antenna height, and other details to a central database, which then tells the WAP what channels it can use and at what power level.

802.11a

Despite the "a" designation for this extension to the 802.11 standard, 802.11a was actually on the market after 802.11b. The 802.11a standard differs from the other 802.11-based standards in significant ways. Foremost is that it's the first Wi-Fi standard to operate in the 5-GHz frequency range. This means devices using this standard are less prone to interference from other devices that use the same frequency range. 802.11a also offers considerably greater throughput than 802.11 and 802.11b, at speeds up to 54 Mbps, though its actual throughput is no more than 25 Mbps in normal traffic conditions. Although its theoretical range tops out at about 150 feet, its maximum range will be lower in a typical office environment.

802.11b

802.11b was the first standard to take off and become ubiquitous in wireless networking. The 802.11b standard supports data throughput of up to 11 Mbps (with actual throughput averaging 4 to 6 Mbps)---on par with older wired 10BASE-T networks---and a maximum range of 300 feet under ideal conditions. In a typical office environment, its maximum range is lower. The main downside to using 802.11b is that it uses a very popular frequency. The 2.4-GHz ISM band is already crowded with baby monitors, garage door openers, microwaves, and wireless phones, so you're likely to run into interference from other wireless devices.

802.11g

802.11g came out in 2003, taking the best of 802.11a and b and rolling them into a single standard. 802.11g offers data transfer speeds equivalent to 802.11a, up to 54 Mbps, with the wider 300-foot range of 802.11b. More important, 802.11g runs in the 2.4-GHz ISM band, so it is backward compatible with 802.11b, meaning that the same 802.11g WAP can service both 802.11b and 802.11g wireless clients.

802.11n

The 802.11n standard (now also known as Wi-Fi 4) brought several improvements to Wi-Fi networking, including faster speeds and new antenna technology implementations.

The 802.11n specification requires all but hand-held devices to use multiple antennas to implement a feature called multiple in/multiple out (MIMO), which enables the devices to make multiple simultaneous connections. With up to four antennas, 802.11n devices can achieve amazing speeds. The official standard supports throughput of up to 600 Mbps, although practical implementation drops that down substantially (to 100+ Mbps at 300+ feet).

NOTE   Because cellular telephones typically support both cellular networks and 802.11x Wi-Fi networks, many can be used to bridge the gap. Using internal utilities or apps, you can set up your phone as a Wi-Fi WAP that can pass signals to and from the Internet via its cellular connection. Turning your phone into a WAP is known as creating a hotspot; using it to bridge to the cellular network is called tethering. Check out Chapters 21 and 24 for the scoop on these techniques.

Many 802.11n WAPs employ transmit beamforming, a multiple-antenna technology that helps get rid of dead spots---or at least make them not so bad. The antennas adjust the signal once the WAP discovers a client to optimize the radio signal.

Like 802.11g, 802.11n WAPs can run in the 2.4-GHz ISM band, supporting earlier, slower 802.11b/g devices. 802.11n also supports the more powerful so-called dual-band operation. To use dual-band, you need a more advanced (and more expensive) WAP that runs at both 5 GHz and 2.4 GHz simultaneously; some support 802.11a devices as well as 802.11b/g devices.

802.11ac

802.11ac, now also known as Wi-Fi 5, is a natural expansion of the 802.11n standard, incorporating even more streams, wider bandwidth, and higher speed. To avoid device density issues in the 2.4-GHz band, 802.11ac only uses the 5-GHz band. The latest versions of 802.11ac include a new version of MIMO called Multiuser MIMO (MU-MIMO). MU-MIMO gives a WAP the ability to broadcast to multiple users simultaneously. Like 802.11n, 802.11ac supports dual-band operation. Some WAPs even support tri-band operation, adding a second 5-GHz signal to support a lot more 5-GHz connections simultaneously at optimal speeds.

802.11ax

802.11ax---which is also known as high efficiency wireless (HEW), brings a number of improvements that should help optimize congested networks and reduce power use on client devices. 802.11ax is marketed as both Wi-Fi 6 and Wi-Fi 6E (for extended), and the latter marks a really exciting development in wireless networking---even if the designations are a little slippery. The initial 802.11ax devices, marketed under the Wi-Fi 6 designation, can use both the 2.4-GHz and 5-GHz bands. Newer Wi-Fi 6E devices (technically 802.11ax-2021) use the 2.4-GHz, 5-GHz, and 6-GHz bands. The 6-GHz band can support more nonoverlapping Wi-Fi channels, is not as saturated with existing Wi-Fi networks, and doesn't suffer as much interference from other devices.

EXAM TIP   Back in October 2018, the Wi-Fi Alliance announced new branding for 802.11n (Wi-Fi 4), 802.11ac (Wi-Fi 5), and 802.11ax (Wi-Fi 6). Many people also extend this style of naming back to older standards (they refer to 802.11g as Wi-Fi 3, and so on), but don't get too distracted by these newfangled names! The CompTIA A+ 1101 objectives only use this style of designation for Wi-Fi 5 and Wi-Fi 6, so you'll still need to have a good grasp of the 802.11x standards. I'm not quite sure if CompTIA will ask about Wi-Fi 6E. Prepare for it, but don't be surprised if you see questions that assume Wi-Fi 6 is still the latest-and-greatest thing in the world of Wi-Fi.

Table 20-1 compares the important differences among modern versions of 802.11x.

802.11ax Products

802.11ax is the standard for any new Wi-Fi rollout. You need to understand variations, so try this! Head out to a big box electronics retail store, like Microcenter or Best Buy (or go online to Newegg). What variations of 802.11ax products do you see? Note the letters and numbers associated with the products. The base models---the least expensive---might list a speed rating like AX1800. Products listed as AX3000 might cost 30 to 50 percent more, and AX6000 might cost a few times more.

Some Wi-Fi 6E devices are starting to turn up---how many models can you find with AXE speed ratings?

Optimizing Wi-Fi Coverage

Good Wi-Fi provides enough data throughput for your devices to do what you need---and covers every spot you need to connect from. Wireless networking data throughput speeds and coverage depend on many factors, but the most important are the wireless standards in use, the distances involved, the amount of interference present, and the kind of antennas in use.

NOTE   As mentioned earlier, there are simple ways to cover large buildings or campuses. You can install multiple WAPs to permit "roaming" between one WAP's coverage area and another's---an EBSS, described earlier in this chapter. Or you can install a replacement WAP with greater signal strength and range. If that is still not enough, wireless repeaters/extenders or a mesh networking kit may do what you need. Networks of any size may need further optimization.

Depending on the standard used, wireless throughput speeds range from a measly 2 Mbps to a snappy 9+ Gbps. One factor affecting speed is the distance between wireless clients and their access points. Wireless devices dynamically negotiate the top speed at which they can communicate without dropping too many data packets. Speed decreases as distance increases, so the maximum throughput speed is achieved only at extremely close range (less than 25 feet or so). At the outer reaches of a device's effective range, speed may decrease to around 1 Mbps before it drops out altogether.

Interference caused by solid objects and other wireless devices operating in the same frequency range---such as microwaves, cordless phones, baby monitors, radar systems, and so on---can reduce both speed and range. So-called dead spots occur when something capable of blocking the radio signal comes between the wireless network clients. Large electrical appliances such as refrigerators block wireless network signals very effectively. Other culprits include electrical fuse boxes, metal plumbing, air conditioning units, and similar objects.

NOTE   You can check the speed and signal strength on your wireless network by looking at the wireless NIC's status. In Windows, open the Network and Sharing Center, select Change adapter settings, then double-click your wireless NIC to view the status dialog box.

Because of these factors, wireless networking range is difficult to define. This is why you'll see most descriptions use qualifiers like "around 150 feet" and "about 300 feet." In Table 20-1 you'll see the maximum ranges listed as those presented by wireless manufacturers as the theoretical maximum ranges. In the real world, you'll experience these ranges only under the most ideal circumstances. True effective range is probably about half what you see listed.

EXAM TIP   Look for basic troubleshooting questions on the CompTIA A+ certification exams dealing with factors that affect wireless connectivity, range, and speed.

Antennas and Transmission Power

These range figures generally assume you'll set up a WAP with an omni-directional antenna in the center of the area (see Figure 20-8) you want to cover. With an omni-directional antenna, the radio wave flows outward from the WAP. This has the advantage of ease of use---anything within the signal radius can potentially access the network. Most wireless networks, especially in the consumer space, use standard straight-wire dipole antennas to provide omni-directional coverage. Dipole antennas look like a stick, but inside they have two antenna arms or poles aligned on the antenna's axis; hence the term "dipole."

Figure 20-8  Room layout with WAP in the center

Many WAPs have removable antennas that you can replace. To increase the signal in an omni-directional and centered setup, simply replace the factory antennas with one or more bigger antennas (see Figure 20-9). They come in several common flavors. Increasing the size of a dipole will increase its gain evenly in all directions. Directional antennas---such as parabolic dish-type antennas---increase gain (and thus range) in a specific direction and reduce gain in all the other directions. The configuration software on some devices will also allow you to tune the transmission power (regardless of which antenna is in use).

Figure 20-9  WAP with replacement antenns

NOTE   Gain in an antenna strengthens and focuses the radio frequency output from a WAP. The ratio of increase---what's called gain---is measured in decibels (dB). The gain from a typical WAP is 2 dB, enough to cover a reasonable area but not a very large room.

In both cases, you should be cautious. A better antenna or higher transmission power may fix your problem, but both are closely regulated. Some antennas may not be legal in your area---or you may not be allowed to use a device with replaceable antennas at all. It may even be possible to increase transmission power to illegal levels and cause trouble for you or your organization.

EXAM TIP   If you want to know whether your local café, bookstore, airport, or other public place has a Wi-Fi access point (a hotspot), you can use a Wi-Fi or wireless locator. Dedicated Wi-Fi locators, also called Wi-Fi analyzers, can also be very expensive---but for basic analysis you can just use your smartphone with a free locator/analyzer app.

Long-Range Fixed Wireless

Long-range fixed wireless, which uses directional antennas, is a great way to interconnect remote buildings when it's hard or impractical to physically run cable to them. Using the right antenna and power level can do more than just extend a network's range a few hundred feet. Powerful directional antennas enable organizations to provide a remote building or structure with network access (up to several miles away) without having to run cable to it. There isn't really a specific set of standards for these point-to-point connections, but there are regulatory requirements.

-   Some organizations use specific equipment, jump through Federal Communications Commission (FCC) regulatory hoops, and pay for a license to use a specific frequency. These may use proprietary or existing wireless protocols.

-   Some organizations use normal Wi-Fi standards (and the corresponding unlicensed spectrum) with special equipment.

-   Still others may start with a normal Wi-Fi standard (with unlicensed spectrum) but end up tweaking the software or hardware (deviating from the standard) to solve unique problems that they face.

Just like with regular Wi-Fi networks, the level of transmission power plays a big role in the distance you can communicate over. Signals with a higher transmit power can travel farther and penetrate more obstacles. You want to be like Goldilocks here---use enough power for the receiver to hear you loud and clear, but not so much that you waste tons of electricity or interfere with other users. These point-to-point links also have regulatory requirements that cap the maximum transmission power they can use. Adjusting transmit power will be covered later in the chapter.

Bluetooth

Bluetooth wireless technology (named for tenth-century Danish king Harald Bluetooth) is designed to create small wireless networks preconfigured to do very specific jobs. Some great examples are wearable technology, audio devices such as headsets or automotive entertainment systems that connect to your smartphone, personal area networks (PANs) that link two computers for a quick-and-dirty wireless network, and input devices such as keyboards and mice. Bluetooth is not designed to be a full-function networking solution, nor is it meant to compete with Wi-Fi.

EXAM TIP   PANs are the smallest "area network" type included in the CompTIA A+ 1101 objectives. Their scope is exactly what it says on the tin---devices that belong to and are near or on a single person.

Bluetooth, like any technology, has been upgraded over the years to make it faster and more secure. The first generation (versions 1.1 and 1.2) supports speeds around 1 Mbps. The second generation (2.0 and 2.1) is backward compatible with its first-generation cousins and adds support for more speed by introducing Enhanced Data Rate (EDR), which pushes top speeds to around 3 Mbps. The third generation (3.0 + HS) tops out at 24 Mbps, but this is accomplished over an 802.11 connection after Bluetooth negotiation. The High Speed (+ HS) feature is optional. Instead of continuing to increase top speed, the fourth generation (4.0, 4.1, and 4.2), also called Bluetooth Smart, is largely focused on improving Bluetooth's suitability for use in networked "smart" devices/appliances by reducing cost and power consumption, improving speed and security, and introducing IP connectivity. The fifth generation (just Bluetooth 5) adds options to increase speed at the expense of range or by changing packet size. Bluetooth 5 adds better support for Internet of Things (IoT) devices, like smart speakers, lights, and so on.

NOTE   Chapter 21 details the Internet of Things. We'll get there!

The IEEE organization has made first-generation Bluetooth the basis for its 802.15 standard for wireless PANs. Bluetooth uses a broadcasting method that switches between any of the 79 frequencies available in the 2.45-GHz range. Bluetooth hops frequencies some 1600 times per second, making it highly resistant to interference.

Generally, the faster and further a device sends data, the more power it needs to do so, and the Bluetooth designers understood a long time ago that some devices (such as a Bluetooth headset) could save power by not sending data as quickly or as far as other Bluetooth devices may need. To address this, all Bluetooth devices are configured for one of three classes that define maximum power usage in milliwatts (mW) and maximum distance:

Bluetooth personal networks are made to replace the snake's nest of cables that currently connects most PCs to their various peripheral devices---keyboard, mouse, printer, speakers, scanner, and the like---but you probably won't be swapping out your 802.11-based networking devices with Bluetooth-based replacements anytime soon. Despite this, Bluetooth's recent introduction of IP connectivity may bring more and more Bluetooth-related traffic to 802.11 devices in the future.

Having said that, Bluetooth-enabled wireless networking is comparable to other wireless technologies in a few ways:

-   Bluetooth is acceptable for quick file transfers where a wired connection (or a faster wireless connection) is unavailable.

-   Bluetooth's speed and range make it a good match for wireless print server solutions.

As mentioned earlier in the chapter, Bluetooth hardware comes either built into newer portable electronic gadgets such as smartphones or as an adapter added to an internal or external expansion bus. Bluetooth networking is enabled through device-to-device connections or (rarely) through Bluetooth access points. Bluetooth access points are very similar to 802.11-based access points, bridging wireless Bluetooth segments to wired LAN segments.

Installing and Configuring Wireless Networking

The mechanics of setting up a wireless network don't differ much from a wired network. Physically installing a wireless network adapter is the same as installing a wired NIC, whether it's an internal card, a laptop add-on wireless card, or an external USB device. Simply install the device and let plug and play handle the rest. Install the device's supplied driver when prompted and you're practically finished.

The trick is in configuring the wireless network so that only specific wireless clients are able to use it and securing the data that's being sent through the air.

Wi-Fi Configuration

Typical wireless networks employ one or more WAPs connected to a wired network segment, such as a corporate intranet, the Internet, or both. These networks require that the same SSID be configured on all clients and WAPs.

Most consumer WAPs have an integrated Web server and are configured through a browser-based setup utility. Typically, you open a Web browser on a networked computer and enter the WAP's default IP address, such as 192.168.1.1, to bring up the configuration page. You need to supply an administrative password, included with your WAP's documentation, to log in (see Figure 20-10). Most newer WAPs ask you to create an administrative password at installation. Setup screens vary from vendor to vendor and from model to model. Figure 20-11 shows the initial setup screen for an ASUS WAP/router.

Figure 20-10  Security login for ASUS WAP

Figure 20-11  ASUS WAP home screen

To make life easier, current WAPs come with a Web-based utility that autodetects the WAP and guides the user through setting up all of its features.

When you purchase a new WAP, there is a pretty good chance the vendor already has updated firmware for it. The chance is even greater if you've had your WAP for a while. Before configuring your WAP for your users to access it, you should check for updates. Refer to the section "Software Troubleshooting," later in the chapter, for more on updating WAP firmware.

Configure the SSID option where indicated. Remember that it's better to configure a unique SSID than it is to accept the well-known default one. The default may help an attacker identify your hardware and focus on any vulnerabilities it is known to have. Avoid names that include an address, name, number, or other description that would help an attacker locate the physical device.

Channel selection is usually automatic, but you can reconfigure this option if you have particular needs in your organization (for example, if you have multiple wireless networks operating in the same area). Use a wireless analyzer to find the "quietest" channel where you intend to install the WAP and select that channel in the appropriate WAP setup/configuration screen. This provides the lowest chance of interference from other WAPs. Clients automatically search through all frequencies and channels when searching for broadcasted SSIDs.

To increase security even more, use MAC filtering. Figure 20-12 shows the MAC filtering configuration screen for an ASUS WAP. Simply click the Add MAC Address button and enter the MAC address of a wireless device that you wish to allow (or deny) access to your wireless network. Set up encryption by setting the security mode on the WAP and then generating a unique security key or password. Then configure all connected wireless devices on the network with the same credentials. Figure 20-13 shows a security settings WAP properties panel configured for WPA2-Personal wireless security.

Figure 20-12  MAC filtering configuration screen for an ASUS WAP

Figure 20-13  Security settings screen for an ASUS WAP

NOTE   As noted earlier in the chapter, the WEP protocol is deprecated. It does provide a little security, but it's easily cracked. Use it only as an absolute last resort if there's some reason you can't just upgrade the equipment. WPA3, WPA2, or even WPA are all better choices.

If you're dealing with ancient equipment and find yourself performing the unseemly task of setting up WEP, you should have the option of automatically generating a set of encryption keys or doing it manually; save yourself a headache and use the automatic method. Select an encryption level---the usual choices are either 64-bit or 128-bit---and then enter a unique passphrase and click the Generate button (or whatever the equivalent button is called on your WAP). Then select a default key and save the settings. The encryption level, key, and passphrase must match on the wireless client or communication will fail. Many WAPs have the capability to export the WEP encryption key data onto a media storage device so you can easily import it on a client workstation, or you can manually configure encryption by using the Windows wireless configuration utility.

WPA encryption (including the preferred WPA3 or WPA2) is configured in much the same way. While it may seem that there are many configuration options, there are effectively two ways to set up WPA/WPA2/WPA3: Personal/Pre-shared Key (PSK) or Enterprise. Personal is the most common for small and home networks (see Figure 20-14). Enterprise is much more complex, requires extra equipment, and is only used in the most serious and secure wireless networks. After selecting the Personal option, there may be "subselections" such as Mixed mode, which allows a WPA3-encrypted WAP to also support WPA2. You may see the term PSK, Pre-Shared Key, or just Personal in the configuration options. If you have the option, choose WPA3 encryption for the WAP as well as the NICs in your network.

Figure 20-14  Encryption screen on client wireless network adapter configuration utility

Settings such as WPA3 for the Enterprise assume you'll enable authentication by using something called a RADIUS server (see Figure 20-15). Larger businesses tend to need more security than a single network-wide password can offer. Their networks often require individual users to log in with their own credentials. Security-conscious organizations may even require their users to log in with more than just a username and password. You'll learn more about this practice, better known as multifactor authentication (MFA), in Chapter 27.

Figure 20-15  Encryption screen with RADIUS option

EXAM TIP   The CompTIA A+ 1101 objectives want you to know about a server role called authentication, authorization, and accounting (AAA)---a server that authenticates users, authorizes what resources they may access, and logs all these actions for accountability. Real-world AAA is complex and often entails multiple servers---but RADIUS and TACACS+ are the main protocols that power AAA whether it involves one server or several.

To power AAA, the network uses authentication protocols like RADIUS and TACACS+ to authenticate each user with an authentication server. Remote Authentication Dial-In User Service (RADIUS) and Terminal Access Controller Access-Control System Plus (TACACS+) are protocols for authenticating network users and managing what resources they may access.

It can be a little tricky to keep TACACS+ and RADIUS straight. I recommend learning more facts than you'll probably need to know about them:

-   RADIUS is a completely open standard developed by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) in a whole boatload of RFCs. RADIUS is partially encrypted and usually uses UDP ports 1812 and 1813. It's more likely to be interoperable between different device manufacturers.

-   TACACS+ was developed as a proprietary protocol by Cisco, though Cisco has released an "open" description of it so that other companies can also implement it. TACACS+ is fully encrypted and uses TCP port 49. It won't be as well supported on non-Cisco hardware.

EXAM TIP   Good network authentication and authorization doesn't stop at the gate! Well-designed networks also validate authentication and authorization when clients access network resources. The Kerberos authentication protocol enables a central authorization server to pass out keys that individual clients can present to access resources as needed. You may never deal directly with Kerberos, but it's extremely common---it's even hard at work under the hood of Microsoft Active Directory.

Businesses can allow only people with the proper credentials to connect to their Wi-Fi networks. For home use, select the Personal version of WPA3/WPA2/WPA. Use the best encryption you can. If you have WPA3 or WPA2, use it. If not, use WPA. WEP is configured in much the same way, but it is a terrible choice for a general network. If you can't upgrade or replace any WEP-only devices, consider setting up a separate WEP network just for them.

NOTE   Always try WPA3-Personal or WPA2-Personal first, depending on what your WAP can handle. If you then have wireless computers that can't connect to your WAP, fall back to WPA2-Personal or WPA-Personal. Use Mixed mode so the newer clients can still take advantage of the extra security provided by WPA3 or WPA2 while older clients can use WPA-Personal.

With most home networks, you can simply leave the channel and frequency of the WAP at the factory defaults, but in an environment with overlapping Wi-Fi signals, you'll want to adjust one or both features. To adjust the channel, find the option in the WAP configuration screens and simply change it. Figure 20-16 shows the channel option in an ASUS WAP.

Figure 20-16  Changing the channel

With multi-band 802.11n, 802.11ac, and 802.11ax WAPs, you can choose whether or not to use the 2.4-GHz, 5-GHz, and 6-GHz bands. In an area with overlapping signals, most of the traffic (at least as of this writing) will be on the 5-GHz frequency. But legacy devices will still be on 2.4 GHz along with other wireless devices such as baby monitors; microwaves also use the 2.4-GHz frequency and can cause a great deal of interference. You can avoid any kind of conflict with your 802.11ac and 802.11ax devices by using the 5-GHz frequency exclusively. Figure 20-17 shows the 2.4-GHz radio being disabled on an 802.11ac WAP.

Figure 20-17  Disabling the 2.4-GHz radio

NOTE   This chapter (and much of the CompTIA A+ 1102 exam) focuses on SOHO wireless deployment. Techs handle the WAP configuration at each WAP, using the built-in firmware, and that's fine for networks with no more than a few access points. Scaling up to cover an entire campus or enterprise building, on the other hand, makes that configuration impossibly time consuming.

Years ago, manufacturers developed wireless LAN controllers to centralize configuration of many dumb WAPs. An organization might have a thousand WAPs but a single software interface for configuring all of them. These days, that configuration interface can be hosted on a local computer or, increasingly, via a cloud-based infrastructure. The latter uses cloud-based network controllers---that's the CompTIA term. You're also likely to see such networks referred to as cloud-managed WLANs.

Bluetooth Configuration and Troubleshooting

As with other wireless networking solutions, Bluetooth devices are completely plug and play. Just connect the adapter and follow the prompts to install the appropriate drivers if your OS needs them. Once installed, you'll need to start the pairing process to enable the devices to create a secure connection---you wouldn't want every Bluetooth client in range to automatically connect with your smartphone! Figure 20-18 shows a Google Nexus phone receiving a pairing request from an iMac called "mediamac."

Figure 20-18  Goggle Nexus receiving a pairing request

Pairing takes a few steps. The first step, of course, is to enable Bluetooth. Some devices, such as Bluetooth headsets, always have Bluetooth enabled because it's their sole communication method. Others, like a Bluetooth adapter in your computer, may be enabled or disabled in the Network and Sharing Center.

Once enabled, the two devices must be placed into pairing mode. Some devices, like the stereo in my car, continuously listen for a pairing request, while others must be set to pairing (or discovery) mode. The devices in pairing mode will discover each other and agree on a compatible Bluetooth version, speed, and set of features.

The final step of the pairing process, the security component, requires you to confirm your intent to pair the devices. Depending on Bluetooth version and device capabilities, there are a number of different ways this could go; these range from the devices confirming the connection without user input to requiring the user to input a short code on one or both devices. If used, these codes are most often four or six digits, but older devices may differ. Refer to your device's documentation for specific details on its pairing process.

Done, right? Well, almost. There remains the final step: make sure everything works. Are you getting sound into your Bluetooth headset or speakers? Does the Bluetooth microphone work when making phone calls or recording notes on your smartphone app? Can you stream music from your smartphone to your car stereo? You get the idea. If something isn't working, it's time to check for two common problems: unsuccessful/incomplete pairing, and configuration issues.

The pairing process is quick and easy to repeat. You may have to delete the pairing from one of the devices first. After re-pairing, test again. If the pairing process never gets started, you have no Bluetooth connectivity. Make sure both devices are on, have Bluetooth enabled, and are in pairing mode. Check battery power in wireless devices and check configuration settings.

If the pairing appears successful but the connection test is not, look for configuration issues. Check microphone input settings and audio output settings. Use any vendor-provided testing and troubleshooting utilities. Keep at it until it works or until you confirm that one or both devices are bad or incompatible.

You'll need to do a little more than just pair devices to connect to a Bluetooth PAN. This connection is handled by your OS in most cases. Figure 20-19 shows the macOS network configuration for a Bluetooth PAN connected through a Nexus phone.

Figure 20-19  macOS Bluetooth PAN connected

NOTE   Wi-Fi and cellular have made Bluetooth Internet connections a rare sight out in the real world.

Troubleshooting Wi-Fi

Wireless networks are a real boon when they work right, but they can also be one of the most vexing things to troubleshoot when they don't. Let's turn to some practical advice on how to detect and correct wireless hardware, software, and configuration problems.

As with any troubleshooting scenario, your first step in troubleshooting a wireless network is to break down your tasks into logical steps. First, of course, identify the problem, then figure out the scope of the problem. Ask yourself who, what, and when:

-   Who is affected by the problem?

-   What is the nature of their network problem?

-   When did the problem start?

In the formal process of troubleshooting, answering these questions is paramount. The answers to these questions dictate at least the initial direction of your troubleshooting.

So, who's affected? If all machines on your network---wired and wireless---have lost connectivity, you have bigger problems than a few wireless machines that cannot access the network. Troubleshoot this situation the way you'd troubleshoot any network failure. Once you determine which wireless devices are affected, it's easier to pinpoint whether the problem lies in one or more wireless clients or in one or more access points.

After you narrow down the number of affected machines, your next task is to figure out specifically what type of error the users are experiencing. If they can access some, but not all, network services, it's unlikely that the problem is limited to their wireless equipment. For example, if they can browse the Internet but can't access any shared resources on a server, they're probably experiencing a permissions-related issue rather than a wireless one.

The last bit of gathering information for this issue is to determine when the problem started. What has changed that might explain your loss of connectivity? Did you or somebody else change the wireless network configuration? For example, if the network worked fine two minutes ago, and then you changed the encryption key or level on the access point, and now nobody can see the network, you have your solution---or at least your culprit! Did your office experience a power outage, power sag, or power surge? Any of these might cause a WAP to fail. And that leads us to the next step of the formal troubleshooting process, establishing a theory of probable cause, which was discussed back in Chapter 1. For now, let's focus on the specifics of troubleshooting Wi-Fi issues.

Once you figure out the who, what, and when, you can start troubleshooting in earnest. Typically, your problem is going to center on your hardware, software, connectivity, or configuration.

Hardware Troubleshooting

Wireless networking hardware components are subject to the same kind of abuse and faulty installation as any other hardware component. Troubleshooting a suspected hardware problem should bring out the technician in you.

Open Windows Device Manager and look for an error or conflict with the wireless adapter. If you see a big exclamation point next to the device, you have a driver error. A downward-facing arrow next to the device indicates that it has been disabled. Enable it if possible or reinstall the device driver as needed.

If you don't see the device listed at all, perhaps it is not seated properly or plugged in all the way. These problems are easy to fix. Just remove and reinstall the device.

NOTE   As with all things computing, don't forget to do the standard PC troubleshooting thing and reboot the computer before you make any configuration or hardware changes!

Software Troubleshooting

Because you've already checked to confirm your hardware is using the correct drivers, what kind of software-related problems are left? Two things come immediately to mind: the wireless adapter configuration utility and the WAP's firmware version.

As I mentioned earlier, some wireless devices won't work correctly unless you install the vendor-provided drivers and configuration utility before plugging in the device. This is particularly true of wireless USB devices. If you didn't do this already, go into Device Manager and uninstall the device, then start again from scratch.

By the time you unpack your new WAP, there's a good chance its firmware is already out of date. Out-of-date firmware could manifest in many ways. Your WAP may enable clients to connect, but only at such slow speeds that they experience frequent timeout errors; you may find that, after a week, your clients can connect but have no Internet access until you reboot the WAP; Apple devices may have trouble connecting or running at advertised speeds. The important thing here is to be on the lookout for strange or erratic behavior.

Manufacturers regularly release firmware updates to fix issues just like these---and many more---so it's good to update the access point's firmware. For older WAPs, go to the manufacturer's Web site and follow the support links until you find the latest firmware version. You'll need your device's exact model number and hardware version, as well as the current firmware version---this is important, because installing the wrong firmware version on your device is a guaranteed way to render it useless! Modern WAPs have built-in administration pages to upload the newly downloaded firmware. Some can even check for firmware updates and install them. Because there are too many WAP variations to cover here, always look up the manufacturer's instructions for updating the firmware and follow them to the letter.

NOTE   When updating the firmware of any device, including your WAP, there's always a chance something could go wrong and render it unusable---and you may hear techs say such a device has been "bricked." Why? It's no more useful than a brick!

Connectivity Troubleshooting

Properly configured wireless clients should automatically and quickly connect to the desired SSID, assuming both the client and WAP support the correct bands. If this isn't taking place, it's time for some troubleshooting. Most wireless connectivity problems come down to either an incorrect configuration (such as an incorrect password) or low signal strength. Without a strong signal, even a properly configured wireless client isn't going to work. Wireless clients use a multi-bar graph (usually five bars) to give an idea of signal strength: zero bars indicate no wireless connectivity and five bars indicates maximum signal. Weak signals or a very busy network (especially with older, closer clients) can both result in slow network speeds, high latency, and intermittent wireless connectivity.

Whether configuration or signal strength, the process to diagnose and repair is similar to what you'd do for a wired network. Since very few wireless NICs have link lights, you can almost always jump right to checking the Wi-Fi configuration utility. Figure 20-20 shows Windows 10 displaying the link state and signal strength.

Figure 20-20  Windows 10's wireless configuration utility

The link state defines the wireless NIC's connection status to a wireless network: connected or disconnected. If your link state indicates that your computer is currently disconnected, you may have a problem with your WAP. If your signal is too weak to receive, you may be out of range of your access point or there may be a device causing interference.

You can fix these problems in a number of ways. Because Wi-Fi signals bounce off of objects, you can try small adjustments to your antennas or WAP placement to see if the signal improves. If your WAP has removable antennas, you can swap out the standard antenna for ones with more transmit power. You can relocate the PC or access point, or locate and move the device causing interference.

You can also run into trouble if there are just too many devices on your network. This can be especially troublesome if you also have some devices that are using old Wi-Fi standards that tie up your WAPs for longer to satisfy the same request than a device using a newer standard would. If you know the network is busy, it might be worth seeing if the problem disappears during off-hours---or even try limiting the number of clients. If you know you've got old Wi-Fi devices around, replacing them or moving them off onto a separate WAP (that uses a different channel) can increase network performance for everyone.

Other wireless devices that operate in the same frequency range as your Wi-Fi can cause external interference as well. Look for wireless telephones, intercoms, and so on as possible culprits. One fix for interference caused by other Wi-Fi devices is to change the channel your network uses. Another is to change the channel the offending device uses, if possible. If you can't change channels, try moving the interfering device to another area or replacing it with a different device.

Configuration Troubleshooting

With all due respect to the fine network techs in the field, the most common type of wireless networking problem is misconfigured hardware or software. That's right---the dreaded user error! Given the complexities of wireless networking, this isn't so surprising. All it takes is one slip of the typing finger to throw off your configuration completely. The things you're most likely to get wrong are the SSID and security configuration, though dual-band routers have introduced some additional complexity.

Verify SSID configuration (for any bands in use) on your access point first, and then check on the affected wireless devices. With most wireless devices, you can use any characters in the SSID, including blank spaces. Be careful not to add blank characters where they don't belong, such as trailing blank spaces behind any other characters typed into the name field.

In some situations, clients that have always connected to a WAP with a particular SSID may no longer be able to connect. The client may or may not give an error message indicating "SSID not found." There are a couple possible explanations for this and they are easy to troubleshoot and fix. The simplest culprit is that the WAP is down---easy to find and easy to fix. On the opposite end of the spectrum is a change to the WAP. Changing the SSID of a WAP will prevent the client from connecting. The fix can be as simple as changing the SSID back or updating the client configuration. A client may not connect to a new WAP, even if it has the same SSID and connection configuration as the previous one. Simply delete the old connection profile from the client and create a new one.

If you're using MAC address filtering, make sure the MAC address of the client that's attempting to access the wireless network is on the list of accepted users. This is particularly important if you swap out NICs on a PC, or if you introduce a new device to your wireless network.

Check the security configuration to make sure that all wireless clients and access points match. Mistyping an encryption key prevents the affected client from talking to the wireless network, even if your signal strength is 100 percent! Remember that many access points have the capability to export encryption keys onto a thumb drive or other removable media. It's then a simple matter to import the encryption key onto the PC by using the wireless NIC's configuration utility. Remember that the encryption level must match on access points and clients. If your WAP is configured for WPA2, all clients must also use WPA2.

CHAPTER 21

The Internet

In this chapter, you will learn how to

-   Explain how the Internet works

-   Connect to the Internet

-   Use Internet application protocols

-   Troubleshoot an Internet connection

The Internet was once the domain of academics and technologists, but over the past few decades it has mushroomed into a dense fabric that interconnects literally billions of devices---including devices used mainly by people and devices that just do their own thing. The Internet was once a place we went intentionally. I'd come home from a long day at work and sit down to be transported into the fantasy universe of a game that I could play with millions of other gamers around the world. I still enjoy escaping into a good game---but these days the Internet itself is the nervous system of modern society!

This chapter covers the skills you need as a tech to help connect devices to the Internet. It starts with a brief section on how the Internet works, along with the concepts of connectivity, and then it goes into the specifics of the protocols and software that you use to make the Internet work for you (or for your client). Finally, you'll learn how to troubleshoot a bad Internet connection. Let's get started!

Historical/Conceptual

How the Internet Works

Thanks to the Internet, people can communicate with one another over vast distances, often in the blink of an eye. As a tech, you need to know how computers communicate with the larger world for two reasons. First, knowing the process and pieces involved in the communication enables you to troubleshoot effectively when that communication goes away. Second, you need to be able to communicate knowledgeably with a network technician who comes in to solve a more complex issue.

You probably know that the Internet joins gajillions of devices together to form the largest network on earth, but not many folks know much about how these computers are organized. Most importantly, the Internet is a network of networks. Some of these networks are large, and others are tiny. Some of these networks belong to families or small shops, while others belong to hospitals, local governments, Internet service providers (ISPs), and of course technology giants like Amazon, Apple, Google, Microsoft, and so on.

Deep inside the infrastructure that makes up the Internet, the largest of these networks are stitched together into a globe-spanning fabric by a piece of equipment called a backbone router. Backbone routers sit along long-distance high-speed fiber optic networks called backbones and connect to more than one other backbone router, creating a framework for transferring massive amounts of data. Figure 21-1 illustrates the decentralized and interwoven nature of the Internet.

Figure 21-1  Internet backbone connections between cities

The key reason for interweaving the backbones of the Internet was to provide alternative pathways for data if one or more of the routers went down. If Jane in Houston sends a message to her friend Polly in New York City, for example, the shortest path between Jane and Polly in this hypothetical situation might be: Jane's message originates at Rice University in Houston, bounces to Emory University in Atlanta, flits through Georgetown University in Washington, DC, and then zips into SUNY in New York City (see Figure 21-2). Polly happily reads the message and life is great. The Internet functions as planned.

Figure 21-2  Message traveling from Houston to NYC

But what would happen if the entire southeastern United States were to experience a huge power outage and Internet backbones in every state from Maryland to Florida were to go down? Jane's message would fail to go through, so the Rice computers would resend Jane's message. Meanwhile, the routers would update their list of good routes and then attempt to reroute the message to functioning nodes---say, Rice to University of Chicago, to University of Toronto, and then to SUNY (see Figure 21-3). It's all in a day's work for the highly redundant and adaptable Internet. At this point in the game, the Internet simply cannot go down fully---barring, of course, a catastrophe of Biblical proportions.

Figure 21-3  Rerouted message from Houston to NYC

TCP/IP: The Common Language of the Internet

As you know from all the earlier chapters in this book, hardware alone doesn't cut it in the world of computing. You need software to make the machines run and create an interface for humans. The Internet is no exception. TCP/IP provides the basic software structure for communication on the Internet.

Because you spent a good deal of Chapter 19 working with TCP/IP, you should have an appreciation for its adaptability and, perhaps more importantly, its extensibility. TCP/IP provides the addressing scheme for computers that communicate on the Internet through IPv4 addresses (such as 192.168.4.1) or IPv6 addresses (like 2603:b23c:d:a421:edcd:9c82:41a4:7a5b). As a suite of protocols, though, TCP/IP is much more than just an addressing system. TCP/IP provides the framework and common language for the Internet. And it offers a phenomenally wide-open structure for creative purposes. Programmers can write applications built to take advantage of the TCP/IP protocols and their features. The cool thing about TCP/IP is that it's proven to be an astonishingly fruitful foundation limited only by the imagination of the programmers building on top of it.

At this point, you have an enormous functioning network. All the backbone routers connect redundant, high-speed backbone lines, and TCP/IP enables communication and services for building applications that enable humans and machines to interface across vast distances. What's left? Oh, of course: How do you tap into this great network and partake of its goodness?

Internet Service Providers

Most of us connect to the Internet by renting access through a company called an Internet service provider (ISP). ISPs come in all sizes. Comcast, the cable television provider, has multiple huge-capacity connections into the Internet, enabling its millions of customers to connect from their local machines and access the Internet. Contrast Comcast with Electric Power Board (EPB) of Chattanooga, an ISP in Chattanooga, Tennessee (see Figure 21-4), which bills itself as "the world's fastest internet." Unfortunately, EPB only offers its blazing 10 gigabit fiber connections to the lucky citizens of Chattanooga.

Figure 21-4  Electric Power Board (EPB) of Chattanooga home-based Internet page

Connection Concepts

Connecting to an ISP requires two things to work perfectly: hardware for connectivity, such as a modem and a working cable line; and software, such as protocols to govern the connections and the data flow (all configured in the OS) and applications to take advantage of the various TCP/IP services. Once you have a contract with an ISP to grant you access to the Internet, they will either send a technician to your house or mail you a package containing any hardware and software you might need. With most ISPs, a DHCP server will provide your computer with the proper TCP/IP information. As you know from Chapter 19, the router to which you connect at the ISP is often referred to as the default gateway. Once your computer is configured, you can connect to the ISP and get to the greater Internet. Figure 21-5 shows a standard computer-to-ISP-to-Internet connection. Note that various protocols and other software manage the connectivity between your computer and the default gateway.

Figure 21-5  Simplified Internet connectivity

1101

Connecting to the Internet

Computers commonly connect to an ISP through their wired or wireless router. If the customer purchased the router, it will have an Ethernet connection to a box (often---but not always---called a modem) that interconnects it with the ISP's network. If the customer leased a router from their ISP, it will often have a built-in modem. The connection to the ISP could use one of many wired or wireless technologies---the modem takes care of the details. Let's take a look at all these various connection options, and then finish this section by discussing basic router configuration and sharing an Internet connection with other computers.

DSL

Digital subscriber line (DSL) connections to ISPs use a standard telephone line with special equipment on each end to create always-on Internet connections.

NOTE   Telephone lines formerly were also used to provide dial-up Internet connections, which are no longer in the CompTIA A+ objectives. They're called dial-up because we literally typed in a telephone number owned by our ISP. The most common form of dial-up used a device called a modem to literally convert digital data to and from analog sound. Integrated Services Digital Network (ISDN) connected a lot faster than analog dial-up and had more bandwidth. Both were very slow by modern standards, and the proliferation of faster connection technologies has made it hard to find an active dial-up or ISDN connection in the wild---but there are still a few kicking around!

Service levels for DSL can vary widely. At the low end of the spectrum, speeds are generally in the single digits---less than 1 Mbps upload and around 3 Mbps download. Where available, more recent xDSL technologies can offer competitive broadband speeds measured in tens or hundreds of megabits per second.

DSL requires little setup from a user standpoint. A tech comes to the house to install the DSL receiver, often called a DSL modem (see Figure 21-6), and possibly hook up a wireless router.

Figure 21-6  A DSL receiver

Even if you skip the tech and have the installation equipment mailed to you, all you have to do is plug a couple of special filters in and call your ISP. These DSL microfilters remove the high-pitch screech of the DSL signal, enabling traditional landline phones and fax machines to operate correctly. The receiver connects to the telephone line and the computer (see Figure 21-7). The tech (or the user, if knowledgeable) then configures the DSL modem and router (if there is one) with the settings provided by the ISP, and that's about it! Within moments, you're surfing the Web. You don't need a second telephone line. You don't need to wear a special propeller hat or anything. The only kicker is that your house has to be within a fairly short distance from a main phone service switching center (central office). This distance can depend on the DSL variant and can range from several hundred feet to around 18,000 feet.

Figure 21-7  DSL connection

NOTE   The two most common forms of DSL you'll find are asymmetric (ADSL) and symmetric (SDSL). ADSL lines differ between slow upload speed (such as 384 Kbps, 768 Kbps, and 1 Mbps) and faster download speed (usually 3--15 Mbps). SDSL has the same upload and download speeds, but telecom companies charge a lot more for the privilege. DSL encompasses many such variations, so you'll often see it referred to as xDSL. (If you see it marketed at all---DSL appears to be going the way of dial-up. Some DSL providers have stopped accepting new customers or ended service altogether.)

Cable

Cable offers a different approach to high-speed Internet access, using regular cable TV cables to serve up lightning-fast speeds. It offers faster service than most DSL connections, with upload speeds from 5 to 35+ Mbps and download speeds ranging anywhere from 15 to 2000+ Mbps. Cable Internet connections are theoretically available anywhere you can get cable TV.

NOTE   The term modem has been warped and changed beyond recognition in modern networking. Both DSL and cable---fully digital Internet connections---use the term modem to describe the box that takes the incoming signal from the Internet and translates it into something the computer can understand.

Cable Internet connections start with an RG-6 or RG-59 cable coming into your house. The cable connects to a cable modem that then connects to a small home router (you will often see the modem and router combined into a single box today) or your network interface card (NIC) via Ethernet. Figure 21-8 shows a typical cable setup using a router.

Figure 21-8  Cable connection

Fiber

In the past, high costs meant that only those with money to burn could enjoy the super-fast speeds of a fiber connection. Subsequently, DSL providers developed very popular fiber-to-the-node (FTTN) and fiber-to-the-premises (FTTP) services that provide Internet (and often Internet and telephone services over the same connection), making them head-to-head competitors with the cable companies. Entrants like Google Fiber and local municipalities have added momentum to the fiber rollout.

With FTTN, the fiber connection runs from the provider to a box somewhere in your neighborhood. This box connects to your home or office using normal coaxial or Ethernet cabling. FTTP runs from the provider straight to a box in your home or office, using fiber the whole way. You might expect this box (which does convert data to and from light) to be called a fiber modem---but it has a better name: an optical network terminal (ONT). The ONT has an input for the fiber connection, and an Ethernet or coax connection for a router which then provides wireless (or Ethernet) to connect your computers to the Internet.

One popular fiber-based service is AT&T Internet (formerly called U-verse), which generally offers download speeds from 10 to 100 Mbps and upload speeds from 1 to 20 Mbps for their FTTN service. AT&T Fiber is their FTTP service that gives you 300 Mbps to 5 Gbps for download and upload (see Figure 21-9). Verizon's Fios service is the most popular and widely available FTTP service in the United States, providing upload and download speeds ranging from 300 Mbps to 1 Gbps. Google Fiber, for its part, offers a 1- and 2-Gbps upload/download service.

Figure 21-9  A Frontier FiOS FTTP ONT in my closet

Wi-Fi

Wi-Fi (or 802.11 wireless) is so prevalent that it's the way many of us get to the Internet. Wireless access points (WAPs) designed to serve the public abound in coffee shops, airports, fast-food chains, and bars. Even some cities provide partial to full Wi-Fi coverage.

EXAM TIP   An 802.11 network that covers a single city is an excellent example of a metropolitan area network (MAN).

We covered 802.11 in detail in Chapter 20, so there's no reason to repeat the process of connecting to a access point. Do remember that most open networks do not provide any level of encryption, meaning it's easy for a bad guy to monitor your connection and read everything you send or receive.

WISP

Another form of wireless Internet service---appropriately called wireless Internet service provider (WISP)---works a little bit like a traditional wired broadband Internet service with a twist: the last segment or two uses a point-to-point long-range fixed wireless connection. The customer just needs to install an antenna provided by the WISP---usually on the outside of their house---and they are online. Since WISPs don't have to run cable to every home they cover, they can often provide cheaper service---or provide service in areas where other broadband providers aren't.

Cellular

Who needs computers when you can get online with any number of mobile devices? Okay, there are plenty of things a phone or tablet can't do, but with the latest advances in cellular data services, your mobile Internet experience will feel a lot more like your home Internet experience than it ever has before. The most common way to access the Internet with a cellular connection---which the CompTIA A+ 1101 exam objectives also refer to as wireless WAN (WWAN)---is directly through a mobile device. It's far from the only way, though! Let's look at the technology first, and then consider how to put it to use.

Cellular data services have gone through a number of names over the years, so many that trying to keep track of them and place them in any order is extremely challenging. In an attempt to make organization somewhat clearer, the cellular industry developed a string of marketing terms using the idea of generations: first-generation devices are called 1G, second-generation are 2G, followed by 3G, 4G, and 5G. On top of that, many technologies use G-names such as 2.5G to show they're not 2G but not quite 3G. You'll see these terms on your phones, primarily if you're not getting the best speed possible (see Figure 21-10). Marketing folks tend to bend and flex the definition of these terms in advertisements, so you should always read more about the device and not just its generation.

The first generation (1G) of cell phone data services was analog and not at all designed to carry packetized data. It wasn't until the early 1990s that two fully digital technologies called the Global System for Mobile Communications (GSM) and code division multiple access (CDMA) came into wide acceptance. GSM evolved into GPRS and EDGE, while CDMA introduced EV-DO. GPRS and EDGE were 2.5G technologies, while EV-DO was true 3G. Standards, with names like UTMS, HSPA+, and HSDPA, have brought GSM-based networks into the world of 3G and 3.5G. These mobile data services provide modest real-world download speeds of a few (generally under 10) Mbps.

We're now at the tail end of the fourth generation. Devices and networks using Long Term Evolution (LTE) technology rolled out worldwide in the early 2010s and now dominate wireless services. As early as 2013, for example, LTE already had ~20 percent market share in the United States, and even higher in parts of Asia. The numbers have only grown since then. Marketed as and now generally accepted as a true 4G technology, LTE networks feature theoretical speeds of up to 1 Gbps download and 100 Mbps upload (see Figure 21-11).

Figure 21-11  Real-world LTE speed test

The fifth-generation cellular networks---appropriately called 5G---saw a big development push in 2018, and rollout started in 2019. The IMT-2020 specifications call for speeds up to 20 Gbps---blazingly fast---but real-world speeds are often a far cry from this (and may vary a lot depending on the carrier and location).

Both 4G and 5G can readily replace wired network technology anywhere there's sufficient cellular data coverage. Most of the big cellular carriers offer home service---a standalone cellular modem you can plug into the wall and connect to your router. You can also use a mobile hotspot---a device that connects via cellular and shares its Internet access---when you're away from home.

EXAM TIP   While any Internet connection type might be metered (i.e., you pay based on how much data you use), it is more common with cellular providers. In Windows, the settings for each network have a toggle you can use to indicate that the connection is metered. Marking a connection as metered will cause well-behaved apps to minimize their data use. The exact change will depend on the app. Common changes in data usage you might see are delaying large downloads until you're on a non-metered connection, not auto-playing media, downloading lower-quality media assets, and so on. For its part, Windows will avoid downloading updates on a metered connection!

Hotspots can be dedicated devices or simply a feature of a modern smartphone. (See Chapter 24 for a deep dive into smartphone technologies.) Using a hotspot to connect to the Internet is often called tethering. Figure 21-12 shows an iPhone in hotspot mode with tethering instructions for Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, and USB.

Figure 21-12  Tethering in iOS

Satellite

Satellite connections to the Internet get the data beamed to a satellite dish on your house or office. Traditionally, providers such as HughesNet and Viasat have used a small number of satellites in very high-altitude geostationary orbits to cover absolutely massive sections of the globe with about 25 Mbps download and 3 Mbps upload speeds. It also means you need to make sure the satellite dish points toward the satellite (generally toward the south if you live in the northern hemisphere)---so you'll usually want it professionally installed with line-of-sight to the satellite. A coax cable runs from the dish to your satellite modem. The satellite modem has an RJ-45 connection, which you may then connect directly to your computer or to a router.

As both satellites and the costs to develop and launch them have shrunk, there's been a surge of interest in satellite Internet services that use a very large number of satellites in low Earth orbit. This kind of service depends on having enough satellites passing over a given area to provide continuous service, but Starlink (one of the most visible providers) is already delivering several times more download and upload bandwidth where it offers service.

Getting your Internet from the stars has some downsides. The first significant issue is the upfront cost of the dish and installation. The signal can also degrade or drop entirely in foul weather such as rain and snow. Many providers also have usage limits, to ensure a small number of users don't degrade the service for everyone on the same satellite. Finally, there's the distance the signal must travel to the satellite. Although low-orbit constellations can provide a level of latency---how long it takes the signal to make the round-trip---that's just a little worse than wired broadband, traditional high-orbit service comes with several hundred milliseconds of latency. This is usually unnoticeable for general Web use, but can make any real-time activity such as gaming or voice/video chat difficult in the best of circumstances.

Connection to the Internet

So you went out and signed up for an Internet connection. Now it's time to get connected. You basically have two choices:

1\.   Connect a single computer to your Internet connection

2\.   Connect a network of computers to your Internet connection

Connecting a single computer to the Internet is easy. If you're using wireless, you connect to the WAP using the provided information, although a good tech will always go through the proper steps described in Chapter 20 to protect the wireless network. If you choose to go wired, you run a cable from whatever type of box is provided to the computer.

If you want to connect multiple computers using wired connections, make sure your router has a built-in switch with enough ports. Several manufacturers offer robust, easy-to-configure routers that are a nice upgrade from the routers provided by the ISP. These boxes require very little configuration and provide firewall protection between the primary computer and the Internet, which you'll learn more about in Chapter 27. All it takes to install one of these routers is simply to plug your computer into any of the LAN ports on the back, and then to plug the cable from your Internet connection into the port labeled Internet or WAN.

There are hundreds of perfectly fine choices for SOHO (small office/home office) routers (see Figure 21-13 for an example). Most have four Ethernet switch ports for wired connections, and one or more Wi-Fi radios for any wireless computers you may have. All SOHO routers use a technology called Network Address Translation (NAT) to perform a little network subterfuge: It presents an entire LAN of computers to the Internet as a single machine. It effectively hides all of your computers and makes them appear invisible to other computers on the Internet. All anyone on the Internet sees is your public IP address. This is the address your ISP gives you, while all the computers in your LAN use private addresses that are invisible to the world. NAT therefore acts as a firewall, protecting your internal network from probing or malicious users on the outside.

Figure 21-13  Common SOHO router with Wi-Fi

EXAM TIP   Many computers can share a smaller pool of routable IP addresses with dynamic NAT (DNAT). A NAT might have 10 routable IP addresses, for example, to serve 40 computers on the LAN. LAN traffic uses the internal, private IP addresses. When a computer requests information beyond the network, the NAT doles out a routable IP address from its pool for that communication. Dynamic NAT is also called Pooled NAT.

This works well enough---unless you're the unlucky 11th person to try to access the Internet from behind the company NAT---but has the obvious limitation of still needing many true, expensive, routable IP addresses.

Basic Router Configuration

SOHO routers require very little in the way of configuration and in many cases will work perfectly (if unsafely) right out of the box. In some cases, though, you may have to deal with a more complex network that requires changing the router's settings. The vast majority of these routers have built-in configuration Web pages that you access by typing the router's IP address into a browser. The address varies by manufacturer, so check the router's documentation. If you typed in the correct address, you should then receive a prompt for a username and password, as in Figure 21-14. As with the IP address, the default username and password vary depending on the model/manufacturer. Once you enter the correct credentials, you will be greeted by the router's configuration pages (see Figure 21-15). From these pages, you can change any of the router's settings.

Figure 21-14  Router asking for username and password

Figure 21-15  Configuration home page

Now we'll look at a few of the basic settings that CompTIA wants you to know. (We'll discuss more advanced settings in Chapter 27 that help keep your network and the computers on it secure while they use services available over the Internet.)

UPnP  A lot of networking devices designed for the residential space use a feature called universal plug and play (UPnP) to find and connect to other UPnP devices. Common UPnP devices include things like media servers and printers. Since this feature enables seamless interconnectivity at the cost of somewhat lowered security, leave it disabled (as shown in Figure 21-16) if you don't need it.

Figure 21-16  Disabled UPnP option

Changing Default Credentials  Since all routers have a default username and default password combination that gives you access to the configuration screen, anyone who has access to your LAN or WLAN can easily gain access to the router and change its settings. One of the first things you should do is change these default login credentials as shown in Figure 21-17.

Figure 21-17  Changing the password

Setting Static IP Addresses  In most cases, when you plug in the router's Internet connection, it receives an IP address (from your ISP) using DHCP just like any other computer. Of course, this means that your Internet IP address can change from time to time. This isn't a problem for most people, but some home users and businesses may want a stable IP address to host their own sites and services. Most ISPs enable you to order a static IP address (for an extra monthly charge) and then either supply you with a preconfigured router or give you IP settings to manually enter into your router. My router has an Internet Setup configuration section where I enter the settings that my ISP has provided (see Figure 21-18). Remember to change your connection type from Automatic/DHCP to Static IP to enter the new addresses.

Figure 21-18  Entering a static IP address

EXAM TIP   The CompTIA A+ 1102 exam objectives call this a static wide-area network (WAN) IP. If you get a question about a static IP address, make sure to figure out whether it's a static LAN or WAN IP before you jump to the answers!

Updating Firmware

Routers are just like any other computer in that they run software---and software has bugs, vulnerabilities, and other issues that sometimes require updating. The router manufacturers call these "firmware updates" and either the router will automatically install them or the manufacturer will make them available for manual install either through the router's administration interface or on the manufacturer's Web site for easy download.

NOTE   While these methods are generally true of routers available commercially, routers provided by your ISP will update automatically.

If the firmware update is available directly through your router's administration interface, a firmware update may be a few clicks away. If not, download the latest firmware from the manufacturer's Web site to your computer. Then enter the router's configuration Web page and find the firmware update screen. On my router, it looks like Figure 21-19. From here, just follow the directions and click Upgrade (or your router's equivalent). A quick word of caution: Unlike a Windows update, a firmware update gone bad can brick your router. In other words, it can render the hardware inoperable and make it as useful as a brick sitting on your desk. This rarely happens, but you should keep it in mind when doing a firmware update.

Figure 21-19  Firmware update page

Using the Internet

The Internet is constantly teeming with activity, but it doesn't actually do a whole lot all by itself. Once you've established a connection to the Internet, you need applications to get anything done. If you want to surf the Web, you need an application called a Web browser, such as Mozilla Firefox, Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge, or Apple Safari. If you want to communicate with people, you might need an e-mail client or one of the many real-time communication applications like Discord, Skype, Slack, Telegram, Teams, Zoom---and tons more. If you want to watch streaming video, you'll need Netflix or one from its always-growing list of competitors.

Underneath the hood, these applications all use one or more application protocols to communicate with the servers that power them. The CompTIA A+ exams expect you to know about a few of the many thousands of applications and application protocols that you might encounter on the Internet---or in your own networks---so this section starts with an overview of the application protocols you may see on the exam, and then looks at how those protocols manifest in different kinds of applications. That's a lot of ground to cover, so buckle up!

Internet Application Protocols

It's possible for application developers to invent their own proprietary protocol for their application and servers to communicate with---but creating a good, secure protocol is a lot of work. Most application developers turn to well-known application protocols that anyone can use. Web browsers use the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) to transfer Web pages and related resources. E-mail clients use Post Office Protocol 3 (POP3) or Internet Message Access Protocol (IMAP) to receive e-mail and Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP) to send e-mail.

Each protocol has its own rules and its own port numbers. Here's an example: most sensitive information sent over the Web (things like credit card information and phone numbers) are sent using an encrypted version of HTTP called Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure (HTTPS). Although HTTPS looks a lot like HTTP from the point of view of a Web browser, HTTPS uses its own port: 443. It's easy to tell if a Web site is using HTTPS because the Web address starts with the protocol---note the https shown in Figure 21-20, instead of just http.

Figure 21-20  A secure Web page

Though there are tens of thousands of application protocols in existence, lucky for you, CompTIA only wants you to understand the following commonly used application protocols (except SFTP and SIP, which CompTIA doesn't list in the objectives but I've added for completeness):

-   World Wide Web (HTTP and HTTPS)

-   E-mail (POP3, IMAP, and SMTP)

-   Telnet

-   SSH

-   FTP/SFTP

-   Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP)

-   VoIP (SIP)

In addition to the application protocols we see and use daily, there are hundreds, maybe thousands, of application protocols that run behind the scenes, taking care of important jobs to ensure that the application protocols we do see run well. You've encountered a number of these hidden application protocols back in Chapter 19. Take DNS. Without DNS, you couldn't type www.google.com in your Web browser and end up at the right address. DHCP is another great example. You don't see DHCP do its job, but without it, any computers relying on DHCP won't receive IP addresses.

In order to differentiate the application protocols you see from the application protocols you don't see, I'm going to coin the term "utility protocol" to define any of the hidden application protocols. So, using your author's definition, HTTP is an application protocol and DNS is a utility protocol. All TCP/IP protocols use defined ports, require an application to run, and have special settings unique to that application. You'll look at several of these services and learn how to configure them. As a quick reference, Table 21-1 lists the names, functions, and port numbers of the application protocols CompTIA would like you to know (except, again, SFTP and SIP). Table 21-2 does the same for utility protocols.

Table 21-1  Application Protocol Port Numbers

Table 21-2  Utility Protocol Port Numbers

You've already encountered a few of these protocols in earlier chapters. The rest of this section will explore many of the different ways to use the Internet, and how the rest of these protocols enable those uses.

EXAM TIP   It's important to know what protocols and ports an application uses. Refer to Chapter 19 if you need a refresher on the TCP and UDP protocols. The CompTIA A+ 1101 exam objectives also expect you to know all of the protocols and ports listed in Tables 21-1 and 21-2 (except SFTP and SIP).

Browsing the Web

If some shadowy character in a trench coat stepped out of an alley, handed you a USB drive, and told you to run the program it holds, I hope you'd be too cautious to just plug it into the same computer you use for work, online shopping, or banking. It may be a surprise if you've never looked under the hood of a Web browser, but what they do isn't that much different!

A Web browser downloads code, images, and other resources from servers more or less anywhere in the world and then runs that code on your own computer in order to render the Web site. To download these resources, the browser interacts with these Web servers using the HTTPS protocol on port 443 and HTTP on port 80. Figure 21-21 shows the home page of my company's Web site, https://www.totalsem.com, in Mozilla Firefox. Where is the server located? Does it matter? It could be in a closet in my office or in a huge data center in Northern Virginia.

Figure 21-21  Mozilla Firefox showing a Web page

NOTE   The most common browsers are Apple Safari, Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge, and Mozilla Firefox---and I recommend you keep at least two of these installed. This gives you a quick fix if you run into a site that has a problem or if a nasty security vulnerability is discovered in your usual browser. These common browsers aren't the only ones, either---there are many other browsers focused on providing some feature or supporting a workflow that the mainstream browsers don't support. If you want to nerd out, there are even browsers you can use from the command line---take Lynx and Browsh for a spin!

Because people use browsers for lots of really important things---like banking and shopping---it's really important to make sure they're secure. Let's take a closer look at what browsers are, where to get them, and a few ways to use them to stay safe.

Installing Browsers

These days, almost all operating systems come with a browser or a simple way to install one. Because we need to be able to trust browsers, it's super important to be cautious about where you get them from. An illegitimate copy of Google Chrome could look and smell just like the real thing---but be subtly compromised to give attackers access to your data or system. Make sure you only install browsers from trusted sources such as your operating system provider's official app store or package manager, or the browser vendor's own Web site.

Your operating system's app store or package manager should automatically help ensure (but not guarantee) that the software you install is legitimate. If you download the installer on your own, it's a good idea to take some additional steps to verify the installer before you run it. The specifics differ, but whether it's done by an app store, package manager, or by hand, this process always involves one or more cryptographic techniques such as hashing and/or code signing.

EXAM TIP   Some operating systems (like Linux) make it very easy to install software from untrusted sources. Others (especially smartphone operating systems) make it much harder. Don't install browsers (or, heck, any software) from untrusted sources! Make sure to verify the hashes or code signatures---and don't ignore verification errors from your OS.

Many (but not all) software developers will publish their own checksums for all of the software they release. A checksum is created by running that file through a cryptographic hash function, which outputs a digital fingerprint for a file. We can repeat this same hashing process after we download the files to confirm that the fingerprints match.

Code signing takes this idea one step further. The developer registers their own digital certificate with whoever develops the OS, app store, or package manager---and uses the certificate to sign the software they release. Your OS, app store, or package manager can then verify these signatures to ensure that the software was released by the registered developer (and not, say, someone who guessed their password). You can check these signatures yourself in Windows by right-clicking the file, selecting Properties, and switching to the Digital Signatures tab (see Figure 21-22).

Figure 21-22  Digital signatures (signed by Google, LLC) for a Google Chrome installer

NOTE   Digital certificates are also powered by cryptography. We'll take a closer look at them a little later in this section, and then again in Chapter 27.

Browser Extensions and Plug-ins

Most modern browsers support additional extensions or plug-ins that modify or extend how they work. There are all kinds of extensions out there, but some common examples are extensions that restyle Web pages, save articles for reading later, block ads, translate pages, and so on. Each browser generally has one trusted source for extensions---either an extension store just for the browser or the operating system's app store. Figure 21-23 shows the Gesturefy extension for Firefox, which enables me to quickly navigate the Web by holding down a key and wiggling my mouse!

Figure 21-23  Gesturefy extension settings in Mozilla Firefox

EXAM TIP   Browser extensions have a lot of power: they can usually read, track, and modify every Web site you visit. It's every bit as important to be careful which ones you install---and I'm pretty sure CompTIA expects you to know not to install them from untrusted sources, either. The real world is a little more complicated than this, though. If your organization has its own private browser extension, for example, it probably won't come from the trusted extension store.

Password Managers

Back in ye olde days we just had to remember or write down the passwords to all of the different online accounts we needed to log on to. That didn't work very well---it made things very easy for hackers. These days, it's a good idea to use a password manager, which helps you out by storing your passwords and the accounts or Web sites they're associated with. You can find standalone password managers, password manager extensions for browsers (shown in Figure 21-24), and even password managers directly built into modern browsers.

Figure 21-24  Adding a password to the Bitwarden password manager extension in Safari

Password managers aren't perfect. Using one can increase the chances that someone with physical or remote access to one of your devices can log on to any of your accounts, for example. But using a password manager also makes it easier to use a different very strong password for every account. A good password manager also helps you identify passwords that are weak, used for more than one service, or have been found in databases of stolen credentials. A good password manager will also make it easy for you to generate strong passwords.

Secure Connections and Sites

Any time you browse the Web---but especially when you're doing sensitive things like logging in to accounts, transferring funds, or making purchases---it's best to make sure you have a secure connection with every site.

Secure connections are supported by an intricate dance that enables the server you're corresponding with to demonstrate that it is registered with a trusted third party known as a certificate authority (CA). Your browser will check to ensure it's a valid certificate, and then negotiate an encrypted connection between your browser and the server. When there's a problem with one of the steps in this dance, your browser will give you some visual indication that the connection may be compromised (as shown in Figure 21-25).

Figure 21-25  Certificate error in Safari

NOTE   Depending on how severe this issue is, your browser may or may not give you the option to ignore the error. Don't get in the habit of clicking through these warnings without thinking. They may be the only thing standing between you and an attacker!

Pop-up and Ad Blockers

Since the earliest days of the Web, users and browsers have been in a back-and-forth war with scammers and advertisers. Two of the main tools at our disposal are the ability to block pop-ups (new windows that open when you visit a site, generally with ads in them) and advertisements. The ability to block these is built directly into some browsers, but pop-up and ad blockers are also some of the most frequently used browser extensions. Figure 21-26 shows my favorite ad-blocking extension hard at work!

Figure 21-26  uBlock Origin obliterating ads in Firefox!

EXAM TIP   Pop-ups are not necessarily bad---it's just very disruptive when a scammer exploits them to open new windows faster than you can close them. It's common, for example, for online stores or browser-based games to make use of pop-ups. Since pop-up blockers keep these from working correctly, any pop-up blocker worth using will have a way to temporarily allow pop-ups and settings you can use to permanently enable them on a given site.

Browsing Data

Because we use browsers to do weird things like collect rare Beanie Babies, spend so much time bingeing old soap operas that Netflix has to ask if we're okay, and ask a search engine about this strange spot on the back of our hands, a lot of people are concerned about the privacy and security implications of the data trail that browsers create.

The CompTIA A+ 1102 exam objectives touch on four different ways to work with browsing data, but before we consider those I want to zoom out and just think about the main kinds of data our browsers accumulate:

-   A running list (called the history) of each page we visit (and potentially which pages are currently open or were open the last time you closed the browser)

-   Scripts running on sites we visit (i.e., cookies and local storage)

-   Site-specific settings and passwords we configure

-   Form data (such as our postal address) that we enable the browser to auto-fill

-   Cached copies of recently downloaded resources

-   A list of recently downloaded files

Each browser handles this data a little differently, and the bad news is that if you don't clean out this stored data, your browser runs slower because every webpage you've visited has to re-download---again. The good news is that there is a way to clear the data and apply settings to control how often you would like for your cache to be cleared. This is called clearing cache. When you go to clear browsing data in Chrome, you'll have the option to select specific types of data, and how much of it to delete. The closest equivalent in Apple Safari enables you to remove data for specific sites---but you'll have to clear things like the history or download list separately. Figure 21-27 shows the options for clearing browsing data in Chrome and Safari.

Figure 21-27  Clearing browsing data in Google Chrome (left) and Apple Safari (right)

Privacy concerns aren't the only reason to clear your browser's cache and or site data. From time to time, your browser or the site you're visiting will make a mistake and you'll end up with some incomplete, incorrect, or simply outdated data in your browser. Clearing the cache, cookies, local storage, and any other browser data for a site can be an important troubleshooting step whenever a Web site or an application you access through your browser is misbehaving.

All of the big browsers also support some kind of private-browsing mode that will disable some forms of data collection and discard most other types of data as soon as you close the private window. These browser modes aren't perfect---some sites will still be tracking you on their end---but it can be a quick way to avoid leaving a bunch of your data behind when you use a shared computer.

Some browsers also support something like the opposite of this---the ability to sign in (either to the browser itself, or your OS provider's cloud account) and have your browser data synchronized among multiple devices. If you use your browser's built-in password manager, it can be particularly useful to have browser data in sync across all the devices you use. You probably shouldn't, however, sign in and set up synchronization on a shared device.

Configuring Web Browsers

Most of the big Web browsers have a built-in settings menu that you'll find inside the main application menu, which usually has a button in the top-right corner. In Google Chrome and Microsoft Edge, you can click the three-dot icon in the upper-right corner of the browser and select Settings. In Mozilla Firefox, the icon is in the same place but looks like a stack of horizontal lines---click it and select Options. (Safari is the outlier, here. In it, you open the Safari menu on the menu bar and select Preferences.)

These menus are very similar but differ from browser to browser (and they change over time). Figure 21-28 shows what the Settings menu in Google Chrome looks like. Take some time to download all the big browsers that you have access to, use each one a bit, and explore their settings. Knowledge of one browser will help you set up the others.

Figure 21-28  Google Chrome Settings

Internet Options

Back in the 1990s, Microsoft made a mistake that we're all still paying for: it deeply integrated its Web browser at the time, Internet Explorer (IE), with Windows. Instead of configuring IE directly in the application, Microsoft gave this job to a Control Panel applet named Internet Options. Nearly 30 years later, Internet Options (see Figure 21-29) contains a grab-bag of settings that affect Internet Explorer, Microsoft Edge, and potentially any other program that uses the Internet.

Figure 21-29  Internet Options applet

The sun is slowly setting on Internet Explorer. It hasn't been the default Windows browser since 2015, and as of June 2022 it's no longer supported in the most common version of Windows 10. The CompTIA A+ 1102 exam objectives for Windows 11 appear to be leaving Internet Options behind---but the objectives for Windows 10 still expect you to recognize scenarios that make use of the old Internet Options applet. It's hard to know exactly what CompTIA has in mind, so I'll give you a quick outline of the options.

EXAM TIP   I think CompTIA is most likely to give you scenarios involving legacy intranet applications or proxy servers. The most obvious reason to use Internet Options is to configure IE---but most people don't need to do this anymore. The big exception is organizations that built or bought applications for internal use that depend on old IE features that modern browsers have removed for security reasons. The next most likely case is that you need to configure the system to use a proxy server.

The Internet Options applet has seven tabs:

-   The General tab has settings to control the most basic features of Internet Explorer: the home page, tab management, your browsing history, searching, and other appearance controls. It's where you'd delete or change how Internet Explorer stores the Web sites you've visited.

-   The Security tab enables you to adjust security settings for a particular zone, such as the Internet, your local intranet, trusted sites, and restricted sites. You can configure which Web sites fall into which zones. This is where you'd relax security rules for an intranet site.

-   The Privacy tab works a lot like the Security tab, except it controls privacy matters (like cookies, location tracking, pop-ups, and whether browser extensions run in private browsing mode). There is a slider that enables you to control what is blocked---everything is blocked on the highest setting; nothing is blocked on the lowest.

-   The Content tab controls what your browser will and will not display. This is where you'd gate access to insecure or objectionable sites and tweak the AutoComplete feature that pre-fills some forms.

-   The Connections tab enables you to set up a connection to the Internet via broadband or dial-up; connect to a VPN; or adjust some LAN settings, which you probably won't need to deal with except perhaps to configure a proxy server connection.

-   Finally, there are the Programs and Advanced tabs. These two are not used much today, but here you can find settings to control add-ons for Internet Explorer, what editor to use for editing HTML, and a list of settings to control how IE works at a granular level. In addition, many of these controls you will find here have been moved to the Settings app or other applets and the buttons in Internet Options are just links to that setting's new location.

EXAM TIP   Some organizations use a proxy server to filter employee Internet access for unsafe content. A proxy server enables multiple connections to the Internet to go through one protected computer. Applications send requests to the proxy server instead of trying to access the Internet directly, which both protects the client computers and enables the network administrator to monitor and restrict Internet access. Normally, you'll just configure the proxy server's address through the Settings app by searching for proxy settings or selecting Network & Internet and clicking Proxy.

Communicating with Others

If you're like me, one of the most important things you do on the Internet these days is communicate with your friends, family, and coworkers. It wasn't all that long ago, really, that you either talked in person, talked on the phone, or wrote a letter, but now there are dozens of ways to keep in touch with people you know---and even strangers! The CompTIA A+ 1102 exams only focus on the two of the oldest and most business-oriented: e-mail and VoIP.

E-mail

To set up and access e-mail, you have a lot of choices today. You can use the traditional ISP method that requires a dedicated e-mail application. Today, though, people use e-mail clients built into whatever device they use. Finally, you can use a Web-based e-mail client accessible from any device. The difficulty with this section is that all of this is blending somewhat with the advent of account-based access to devices, such as using your Microsoft account to log on to your Windows PC.

All e-mail addresses come in the accountname@Internet domain format. To add a new account, provide your name, e-mail address, and password. Assuming the corporate or organization server is set up correctly, that's all you have to do today.

In the not so distant past, however, and still referenced on the CompTIA A+ exams, setting up an e-mail client had challenges. Not only did you have to have a valid e-mail address acquired from the provider and a password, you had to configure both the incoming and outgoing mail server information. You would add the names of the Post Office Protocol version 3 (POP3) or Internet Message Access Protocol version 4 (IMAP4) server and the Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP) server. The POP3 or IMAP server is the computer that handles incoming (to you) e-mail. Most mail happens through the latest version of IMAP, IMAP4. The SMTP server handles your outgoing e-mail.

EXAM TIP   Make sure you know your port numbers for these e-mail protocols! POP3 uses port 110, IMAP uses port 143, and SMTP uses port 25. Also, you will almost certainly get one or two questions on which protocol handles incoming mail (POP3 or IMAP) and outgoing mail (SMTP).

Integrated Solutions  All mobile devices have an integrated e-mail client, fully configured to work within the mobile ecosystem. Apple devices, such as the iPad, enable you to create and use an iCloud account that syncs across all your Apple devices. The iCloud e-mail setup process assumes you'll use iCloud for all that sending and receiving stuff and thus you have no other configuration to do. All the settings for IMAP, POP, SMTP, and so on happen behind the scenes. CompTIA calls this sort of lack of configuration integrated commercial provider email configuration. That's pretty accurate, if a little bland. You will see more of this in Chapter 24.

Web Mail  Most people use Web-based e-mail, such as Yahoo! Mail, Gmail from Google, or Exchange Online from Microsoft, to handle all of their e-mail needs (see Figure 21-30). Web-based mail offers the convenience of having access to your e-mail from any Internet-connected computer, smartphone, tablet, or other Internet-connected device. While desktop clients may offer more control over your messages and their content, Web-based e-mail has caught up in most respects. For example, Web services can provide superior spam-filtering experience by relying on feedback from a large user base to detect unwanted or dangerous messages.

Figure 21-30  Web-based e-mail

EXAM TIP   One of the big benefits of using somebody else's e-mail service is that they do most of the work to deal with spam. If you use your own domain for e-mail, you'll have to set up some DNS records that you saw back in Chapter 19. In addition to the MX records that other e-mail providers use to decide where to route e-mail for your domain, you'll also have to set up a number of spam management records (DKIM, SPF, and DMARC) to have much hope of your own outgoing mail being delivered.

Unified Internet Accounts  When I log on to my Windows desktop computer, I use my Microsoft account, a fully functional e-mail account hosted by Outlook. Doing so defines the default e-mail experience on that machine. When I access the Mail client, for example, it immediately accesses my Hotmail account (see Figure 21-31). There's no configuration from a user's or tech's perspective. The same is true when you log on to any Apple device, whether it's a mobile device or smartphone, or a macOS desktop machine. Microsoft calls this feature Live sign in.

Figure 21-31  Windows Mail

Organization E-mail  For decades now, businesspeople around the world have used Microsoft Outlook---part of the Microsoft Office suite---to manage their e-mail. In the Office 365 era, just logging in to your Microsoft account will automatically configure Outlook to use the correct Exchange server. If your organization runs its own Exchange server, you may need to set it up manually. The main times you'll need to intervene are when there isn't a domain network to lean on, when something's changing (like when a company rebrands itself), or when the existing Outlook profile gets broken (see Figure 21-32).

Figure 21-32  Mail applet in Windows 10

EXAM TIP   You can usually reconfigure Outlook directly, but the CompTIA A+ 1102 exam objectives for Windows 10 also want you to know that you can also do this with the Mail applet in Control Panel. Scenarios where you might find the Mail applet helpful include setting up new users or accounts for an organization-operated Exchange server; the Outlook profile is broken (since this can make it impossible to open Outlook); or you need to update the profile while making sure you don't see the user's mail!

Voice over IP

You can use Voice over IP (VoIP) to make voice calls over your computer network. Why have two sets of wires, one for voice and one for data, going to every desk? Why not just use the extra capacity on the data network for your phone calls? That's exactly what VoIP does for you. VoIP works with every type of high-speed Internet connection, from DSL to cable to satellite.

VoIP doesn't refer to a single protocol but rather to a collection of protocols that make phone calls over the data network possible. The most common VoIP application protocol is Session Initiation Protocol (SIP), but some popular VoIP applications such as Skype are completely proprietary.

Vendors such as Skype, Cisco, Vonage, Arris, and Comcast offer popular VoIP solutions, and many corporations use VoIP for their internal phone networks. VoIP isn't confined to your computer, either. It can completely replace old copper phone lines. Two popular ways to set up a VoIP system are to either use dedicated VoIP phones, like the ones that Cisco makes, or use a dedicated VoIP box (see Figure 21-33) that can interface with your existing analog phones.

Figure 21-33  Arris VoIP telephony modem

True VoIP phones have RJ-45 connections that plug directly into the network and offer advanced features such as HD-quality audio and video calling. Unfortunately, these phones require a complex and expensive network to function, which puts them out of reach of most home users.

For home users, it's much more common to use a VoIP phone adapter to connect your old-school analog phones. These little boxes are very simple to set up: just connect it to your network, plug in a phone, and then check for a dial tone. With the VoIP service provided by cable companies, the adapter is often built right into the cable modem itself, making setup a breeze.

Remote Access

One of the big advantages of a ginormous, always-on network of networks is that many people can do some or all of their work remotely---whether that means from another city, or just without walking from workstation to workstation. You can take advantage of remote access technologies to manage servers and workstations and use them to train users or troubleshoot their problems. Likewise, you'll almost certainly need to configure some resource to ensure it's available remotely.

The CompTIA A+ 1102 exam objectives want you to know about quite a few remote access technologies, so let's dive in!

Telnet and SSH

Telnet is a terminal emulation program for TCP/IP networks that uses port 23 and enables you to connect to a server or fancy router and run commands on that machine as if you were sitting in front of it. This way, you can remotely administer a server and communicate with other servers on your network. Unfortunately, Telnet shares FTP's bad habit of sending passwords and usernames as clear text, so you should generally use it only as a last resort, and only within your own LAN.

The secure, modern alternative to Telnet, Secure Shell (SSH), has replaced Telnet almost everywhere Telnet used to be popular. As a user, SSH works just like Telnet. Behind the scenes, SSH uses port 22, and the entire connection is encrypted to prevent eavesdroppers from reading your data. SSH has another trick up its sleeve: it can move files or any type of TCP/IP network traffic through its secure connection. This practice, called tunneling, plays a role in other secure networking technologies that we'll discuss later in the chapter such as SFTP and VPN.

SSH is encrypted, but its security is only as strong as your password. If you have a machine with a publicly accessible SSH server, it will be under constant attack by hackers trying to guess the password!

Remote Desktop

The kind of remote command-line access you can get with SSH is great for a lot of geeky administrative tasks, but it isn't so good at general productivity---like accessing an application that is only installed on one machine. When you need remote access to the full graphical desktop, you need a remote desktop application.

NOTE   Because "remote desktop" is a generic term, you may find some programs with confusingly similar names. Microsoft and Apple both at one point made a program called Remote Desktop (the latter is a paid offering), though Microsoft's version is called Remote Desktop Connection in current versions of Windows. Then there's Microsoft's Remote Desktop Connection for Mac, which is just for enabling macOS machines to connect to a Windows remote desktop.

While some operating systems include a remote desktop client, many third-party remote desktop applications are also available. Most of these make use of either the Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) or Virtual Network Computing (VNC). TightVNC, for example, is totally cross-platform, enabling you to run and control a Windows system remotely from your Mac or vice versa, for example. Figure 21-34 shows TightVNC in action. The Screen Sharing app built into macOS also uses VNC; it's modest, but it's good enough for basic remote access, collaboration, and light remote troubleshooting.

Figure 21-34  TightVNC in action

Windows offers an alternative to VNC: Remote Desktop Connection. Remote Desktop Connection provides control over a remote server with a fully graphical interface. Your desktop becomes the server desktop (see Figure 21-35).

Figure 21-35  Windows Remote Desktop Connection dialog box

Wouldn't it be cool if, when a client called about a technical support issue and says that something doesn't work, you could transfer yourself from your desk to your client's desk to see precisely what the client sees? This would dramatically cut down on the miscommunication that can make a tech's life so tedious. Microsoft Remote Assistance (MSRA) does just that (though there are also other third-party applications that offer the same capability). Remote Assistance enables you to give anyone control of your desktop or take control of anyone else's desktop. If a user has a problem, that user can request support (see Figure 21-36) directly from you. Upon receiving the support-request e-mail, you can then log on to the user's system and, with permission, take the driver's seat.

Figure 21-36  Remote Assistance wizard

EXAM TIP   These remote desktop programs generally require direct network access to the system you want to use. There are also Internet-based screen sharing or remote desktop services that enable access from anywhere you have an Internet connection. This may sound great, but be careful! These services basically punch a hole in your network that anyone who compromises the user's credentials with the service can walk through.

With Remote Assistance, you can do anything you would do from the actual computer. You can troubleshoot some hardware configuration or driver problem. You can install drivers, roll back drivers, download new ones, and so forth. You're in command of the remote machine as long as the client allows you to be. The client sees everything you do, by the way, and can stop you cold if you get out of line or do something that makes the client nervous! Remote Assistance can help you teach someone how to use a particular application. You can log on to a user's computer and fire up Outlook, for example, and then walk through the steps to configure it while the user watches. The user can then take over the machine and walk through the steps while you watch, chatting with one another the whole time. Sweet!

Remote desktop applications provide everything you need to access one system from another. They are common, especially considering that Microsoft provides Remote Desktop for free. Whichever application you use, remember that you will always need both a server and a client program. The server goes on the system you want to access and the client goes on the system you use to access the server. With many solutions, the server and client software are integrated into a single product.

In Windows, you can turn Remote Assistance and Remote Desktop on and off and configure other settings. Go to the System applet in Control Panel and then select the Remote settings link on the left. Under the Remote tab in System Properties you will see checkboxes for both Remote Assistance and Remote Desktop, along with buttons to configure more detailed settings.

EXAM TIP   You can also access the Remote Assistance settings through the Settings app. Open the System settings, select About, click Advanced system settings, and select the Remote tab. This is the exact same interface you'd reach via the Control Panel!

Video-Conferencing Software

The first few things I think of when it comes to video-conferencing software are a screen with a grid of little faces and an occasional cat wandering around, the dull background roar from that guy who called in from his car on the highway, and people trying to talk over each other. But there are some interesting surprises lurking in the presentation-focused features of programs like Microsoft Teams and Zoom.

These programs not only make it easy for someone to share windows or even their entire desktop with whoever else is on the call---but they enable you to give someone else on the call control of your desktop. As a tech, you can use this feature to help a user troubleshoot a problem just like you would in Remote Assistance.

Virtual Private Networks

It's been possible to connect to a remote network for a long time, but back before the Internet existed the main connection options were a telephone line or an outrageously expensive private connection. The introduction of the Internet gave people a way to stop using dial-up and expensive private connections and use the Internet instead, but they wanted to do it securely.

A popular way to secure connections like this entails setting up an encrypted tunnel between the two points---over the open Internet (see Figure 21-37)---creating what we call a virtual private network (VPN).

Figure 21-37  VPN connecting computers across the United States

An encrypted tunnel requires endpoints---the ends of the tunnel where the data is encrypted and decrypted. In the SSH tunnel you've seen thus far, the client for the application sits on one end and the server sits on the other. VPNs do the same thing. Either some software running on a computer or, in some cases, a dedicated Internet appliance such as an endpoint management server must act as an endpoint for a VPN (see Figure 21-38).

Figure 21-38  Typical tunnel

NOTE   An Internet appliance is a dedicated box that accomplishes a specific function or functions. You'll see these in many other uses in Chapter 27.

VPNs require a protocol that itself uses one of the many tunneling protocols available and adds the capability to ask for an IP address from a local DHCP server to give the tunnel an IP address that matches the subnet of the local LAN. The connection keeps the IP address to connect to the Internet, but the tunnel endpoints act like NICs (see Figure 21-39). Let's look at how to set up a VPN connection.

Figure 21-39  Endpoints must have their own IP addresses.

In Windows, type VPN in Start | Search and select VPN settings. Clicking Add a VPN connection presents you with a screen where you can enter all your VPN server information (see Figure 21-40). Your network administrator will most likely provide this information to you. The result is a virtual network card that, like any other NIC, gets an IP address from the DHCP server back at the office.

Figure 21-40  Adding a VPN connection in Windows

NOTE   A system connected to a VPN looks as though it's on the local network but often performs much slower than if the system were connected directly back at the office.

When your computer connects to the VPN server on the private network, it creates a secure tunnel through the Internet back to the private LAN. Your client takes on an IP address for that network, as if your computer were plugged into the LAN back at the office.

Depending on the configuration of your VPN connection, your Internet traffic may go through your office first. This can help secure the rest of your Internet traffic---but it can also slow it down (and large downloads can bottleneck the organization network if it doesn't have enough bandwidth). VPN connections are convenient, but they can give an attacker an easy way to get into your network---especially if they steal a user's credentials or a user device configured to automatically log in.

File Transfer Software

Sometimes users don't even need direct access to organization's network or workstations to get their work done remotely---they just need access to the right files! There's a whole ecosystem of services that enable you to share, synchronize, and transfer files among different users or among a single user's devices. Some of the best-known examples are Dropbox, Apple iCloud, Google Drive, and Microsoft OneDrive---but there are plenty more. In general, software like this comes with an application that you'll install on every device you want to synchronize files across, and then use the application to specify exactly what gets synchronized.

These services can be an obvious alternative to opening up your entire network to attack if someone's credentials are swiped---but they also make it a lot easier for users to intentionally or accidentally leak files with sensitive information. Each organization will have to make its own call on these trade-offs.

EXAM TIP   The CompTIA A+ 1102 exam objectives include file transfer software as a kind of remote access technology, so that's how I'm approaching it here. There's also an emerging managed file transfer industry that focuses on providing enterprise-grade file transfer services that make it easy for big organizations to audit who has access to which files and track who has actually downloaded them. These services focus on helping large organizations do things like better secure their files, meet regulatory requirements, or transfer massive files between organizations.

Desktop Management Software

The remote access technologies you've seen so far are fairly limited. They give you a specific kind of access, but otherwise leave the rest up to you. Desktop management software, however, gives you a full suite of management tools you can use to configure devices, update or install software, open a remote desktop session to interactively fix issues, enforce security policies, manage user accounts, turn off idle systems---and much more. You may also hear people call this software endpoint management software (especially when the software also manages mobile devices).

Remote Monitoring and Management (RMM)

Remote monitoring and management (RMM) software builds on the capabilities of desktop or endpoint management software by also layering in robust monitoring and management of your network---including network devices and servers. Organizations that use an RMM solution have one place to go to understand and manage the health of their wired and wireless network infrastructure, ensure the servers running in their network have the latest security updates, and monitor workstations for unauthorized software!

EXAM TIP   Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) enables remote monitoring and configuration of just about anything on a network. Assuming all your computers, switches, routers, and so on are SNMP-capable, you can use programs to query the network for an unimaginable amount of data. SNMP is a popular protocol to check on your network, but it's the sort of thing you probably won't need to use unless you're a Network+ tech. You'll also find SNMP (along with other protocols) hard at work under the hood of RMM software.

Sharing and Transferring Files

Once upon a time, someone had to physically move their body to share files with someone else or move files between systems. You'd put them on some kind of disk, and then walk the disk over (or throw it like a frisbee) to whoever needed it. At the dawn of the computing era, it was even common for people to "install" software by hand-typing from a paper copy of the program's source code!

All of this extra work is a big part of why early networks were really exciting even long before they were connected to the Internet. Sharing and transferring files is every bit as important in the Internet era---so much so that the way we transfer files has been reinvented a few times over. Let's look at a few of the most common ways it's been done.

File Transfer Protocol

File Transfer Protocol (FTP) emerged in the early 1970s (though it's been updated several times since then) as a great way to transfer files between client systems and an FTP server. It was also the way to download software or update your Web site on the early Internet. FTP server software exists for most operating systems, so you can use FTP to transfer data between any two systems regardless of the OS. FTP uses ports 20 and 21.

To access an FTP site, you must use an FTP client such as FileZilla or Cyberduck (shown in Figure 21-41). For much of the Internet's life, it was possible to access FTP servers through a Web browser---but the sun set on this era in 2021, when both Mozilla Firefox and Google Chrome removed support.

Figure 21-41  The Cyberduck FTP program running on macOS

FTP servers require you to log on, though many public download-only servers (and clients) will use "anonymous" as the default. Most FTP clients can store username and password settings to make it easy to reconnect to servers you use regularly. Beware that FTP was developed during a more trusting time---your username and password will be sent over the network in easily intercepted clear text. Don't use the same password for an FTP server that you use for your domain logon at the office!

TFTP

Trivial FTP (TFTP) is an old, bare-bones file transfer protocol that lacks many of the features---like authentication and listing files---that FTP includes. It isn't very popular, but its simplicity gives it a leg up in some narrow cases such as downloading system images to boot a device from the network. If you recall that a big difference between UDP and TCP is that TCP can detect and recover from errors, you might be surprised to know TFTP uses UDP port 69. File transfer does need to avoid errors, and TFTP has its own built-in mechanisms for doing so.

EXAM TIP   The CompTIA A+ 1101 objectives list TFTP and DHCP as examples of connectionless (UDP) protocols, and HTTPS and SSH as examples of connection-oriented (TCP) protocols. I am not sure exactly why CompTIA wants you to know these four specific protocols---but it's worth memorizing them just in case you see a question that asks you to pick connectionless or connection-oriented protocols out of a lineup!

SFTP

Secure FTP is a network protocol for transferring files over an encrypted SSH connection. You can (and should!) use SFTP for the same things you'd use FTP for---but it is technically its own distinct protocol. The SFTP protocol was written as an extension of SSH, so you can find SFTP client and server support built into SSH software, such as the popular OpenSSH. In Figure 21-42, I'm using SFTP to transfer a Web server log.

Figure 21-42  OpenSSH

Embedded Systems

One easy-to-miss aspect of the computing landscape is that there are tons and tons of computers out there that don't look like computers. These computers, known as embedded systems, have been built into all kinds of stuff---things like appliances, game consoles, cars, medical equipment, missiles, equipment in factories---for decades now.

For a long time, these computers were modest. They played small roles in controlling a device or supporting specific features. Over time, many of these computers have evolved into networked smart devices that are both more capable and cause new problems. Let's consider what these devices look like in an industrial setting first, and then see how they manifest in day-to-day life.

Industrial Control Systems

Once upon a time, factories were just a place where a bunch of people came together and used human-powered tools to build things. Waves of new technologies slowly transformed them. For much of the 19th and 20th centuries, factories were places where humans directly controlled or worked in tandem with powerful machines driven by steam or electricity. In the 21st century, our most-advanced factories are becoming fully automated, palace-sized machines maintained by a small number of people.

This latest transformation is being driven by increasingly sophisticated industrial control systems (ICSs) that monitor and control (or, at least, help humans monitor and control) many if not all parts of the equipment, materials, and processes they oversee.

Some key industrial technologies (like railroads, power grids, networks of water pumps, pipelines, and so on) that tend to be distributed over wide areas often use a specialized type of ICS. Supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) systems are designed to manage processes that are spread out over a wide area---and to help with the problem of operating the system safely when something temporarily disrupts connectivity between parts of the system.

Organizations that operate these control systems must carefully balance two needs that can come into conflict. Since these systems might be monitoring and controlling dangerous high-energy processes such as a hydroelectric dam, nuclear power plant, or a process for melting and pouring molten metal, keeping them secure can be a matter of life and death. The other side of this coin is that remote access can make it much easier to manage these systems efficiently and safely.

The Internet of Things

Some embedded systems go a step beyond just being able to use the Internet for remote monitoring and management. These devices, which actively use the Internet all on their own during their regular operation, are said to be part of the Internet of Things (IoT). Some of the IoT devices you're most likely to encounter in day-to-day life include things like refrigerators, thermostats, light switches, security cameras, door locks, and smart speakers/digital assistants---but the IoT also includes less-obvious things like parking meters, vending machines, and environment sensors.

EXAM TIP   Network-accessible embedded systems and IoT devices---and especially legacy embedded systems such as SCADA---can be a security risk. These devices tend to live a long life, may not be designed with network security in mind, and may not receive software updates like other networked devices, and it can be hard to notice that they're compromised. It's a good idea to be cautious about letting them on the network at all. If you must, use VLANs (which we discussed in Chapter 19) to isolate these devices on their own network segments. This protects the devices themselves---and helps protect the rest of the network if they're compromised.

We can access, configure, and command these devices over the Internet, but more importantly, the devices themselves regularly use the Internet to report conditions, initiate credit card transactions, download software updates, and so on. I can't show you how every device works, but let's take a look at one of the most iconic: the Nest smart thermostat (see Figure 21-43).

Figure 21-43  Wi-Fi details on a Nest thermostat (left) and Nest smartphone app (right)

You can control a smart thermostat from any device connected to the Internet, such as your computer at the office or your smartphone on the commute. But the Nest thermostat can also use the Internet all on its own---for example, to report when it ran the heater or air conditioner or to automatically adjust its usage to the real-time price of electricity in your area.

NOTE   IoT devices use a number of protocols that are carefully designed for embedded devices (including Thread, Z-Wave, Zigbee, and more), and the ecosystem is evolving rapidly. Some common themes are lowering power use and leveraging mesh networks to route messages through other IoT devices.

Internet Troubleshooting

There isn't a person who's spent more than a few hours on a computer connected to the Internet who hasn't run into some form of connectivity problem. I love it when I get a call from someone saying, "The Internet is down!" as I always respond the same way: "No, the Internet is fine. It's the way you're trying to get to it that's down." Okay, so I don't make a lot of friends with that remark, but it's actually a really good reminder of why we run into problems on the Internet. Let's review the common symptoms CompTIA lists on their objectives for the CompTIA A+ 220-1101 exam and see what we can do to fix these all-too-common problems.

The dominant Internet setup for a SOHO environment consists of some box from your ISP such as a cable/DSL modem, fiber ONT, etc. that connects via Ethernet cable to a home router. This router is usually 802.11 capable and includes four Ethernet ports. Some computers in the network connect through a wire and some connect wirelessly (see Figure 21-44). It's a pretty safe assumption that CompTIA has a setup like this in mind when talking about Internet troubleshooting, and we'll refer to this setup here as well.

Figure 21-44  Typical SOHO setup

One quick note before we dive in: Most Internet connection problems are network connection problems. In other words, everything you learned in Chapter 19 applies here. We're not going to rehash those repair problems in this chapter. The following issues are Internet-only problems, so don't let a bad cable fool you into thinking a bigger problem is taking place.

No Connectivity

As you'll remember from Chapter 19, "no connectivity" has two meanings: a disconnected NIC or an inability to connect to a resource. Since Chapter 19 already covers wired connectivity issues and Chapter 20 covers wireless issues, let's look at lack of connectivity from a "you're on the Internet but you can't get to a Web site" point of view:

1\.   Can you get to other Web sites? If not, go back and triple-check your local connectivity.

2\.   Can you ping the site? Go to a command prompt and try pinging the URL as follows:

The ping is a failure, but we learn a lot from it. The ping shows that your computer can't get an IP address for that Web site. This points to a DNS failure, a very common problem. To fix a failure to access a DNS server, try these options:

-   In Windows, go to a command prompt and type ipconfig /flushdns:

NOTE   While the commands are similar, ifconfig and iwconfig aren't suitable for flushing the DNS cache, if it exists, in macOS or Linux.

-   In Windows 10, go to Network & Internet in the Settings app and click Network troubleshooter (see Figure 21-45). (This option still exists in Windows 11, but you may have to use Find a setting to search for it.)

Figure 21-45  Diagnosing a network problem in Windows 10

-   Try using another DNS server. There are lots of DNS servers out there that are open to the public. Try Google's famous 8.8.8.8 and 8.8.4.4 or Cloudflare's 1.1.1.1 and 1.0.0.1.

If DNS is OK, make sure you're using the right URL. This is especially true when you're entering DNS names into applications such as e-mail clients.

Limited Connectivity

Limited connectivity points to a DHCP problem, assuming you're connected to a DHCP server. Run ipconfig and see if you have an APIPA address:

Uh-oh! No DHCP server! If your router is your DHCP server, try restarting the router. If you know the Network ID for your network and the IP address for your default gateway (something you should know---it's your network!), try setting up your NIC statically.

Local Connectivity

Local connectivity means you can access network resources but not the Internet. First, this is a classic symptom of a downed DHCP server since all the systems in the local network will have APIPA/link local addresses. However, you might also have a problem with your router. You need to ping the default gateway; if that's successful, ping the other port (the WAN port) on your router. The only way to determine the IP address of the other port on your router is to access the router's configuration Web page and find it (see Figure 21-46). Every router is different---good luck!

Figure 21-46  Router's WAN IP address

You can learn a lot by looking at your WAN IP address. Take a look at Figure 21-47. At first glance, it looks the same as Figure 21-46, but notice that there is no IP address. Most ISPs don't provide static IP addresses---they simply give you the physical connection, and your router's WAN network card uses DHCP, just like most internal networks. If you're lucky, you can renew your DHCP address using some button on the router's configuration. If not, try resetting the cable/fiber/DSL modem. If that doesn't work, it's time to call your ISP.

Figure 21-47  No WAN connection

Slow Network Speeds

No matter how fast the connection is, we all want our Internet to go faster. People tolerate a certain amount of waiting for a large program to download or an HD video to buffer, but your connection can sometimes slow down to unacceptable speeds.

Remember that your Internet connection has a maximum speed at which it can transfer. If you divide that connection between multiple programs trying to use the Internet, all of your programs will connect very slowly. To see what's happening on your network, open a command prompt and type netstat, which shows all the connections between your computer and any other computer. Here's a very simplified example of netstat output:

If you look at the Foreign Address column, you'll see that most of the connections are Web pages (HTTP and HTTPS) or shared folders (microsoft-ds, netbios-ssn), but what is the connection to 12.162.15.1:57080? Not knowing every connection by heart, I looked it up on Google and found out that there was a background torrent program running on my machine. I found the program and shut it down.

When everyone on the network is getting slow Internet connectivity, it's time to check out the router. In all probability, you have too many people who need too much bandwidth---go buy more bandwidth!

When additional bandwidth isn't an acceptable solution, you'll need to make the most of what you have. Your router can use a feature called Quality of Service (QoS) to prioritize access to network resources. QoS enables you to ensure certain users, applications, or services are prioritized when there isn't enough bandwidth to go around by limiting the bandwidth for certain types of data based on application protocol, the IP address of a computer, and all sorts of other features. Figure 21-48 is a typical router's QoS page.

Figure 21-48  QoS

Latency and Jitter

Any real-time application---things like VoIP, teleconferencing, streaming video, and video games---can prove unworkable if you have miserable high latency. In all of these cases, but especially with VoIP, a key to troubleshooting is that low network latency is more important than high network speed (as long as your connection meets the minimum bandwidth that the application needs). The higher the latency, the more problems, such as noticeable delays during your VoIP call.

Another kind of latency problem, jitter, is caused by rapid latency fluctuations, which can in turn make packets arrive in bursts or out of order. While true high latency generally just causes long delays, jitter can garble audio and video signals or break the connection altogether. In all cases, you can assess the latency (and how consistent it is) with tools such as ping, tracert/traceroute, and pathping.

Try This!

Checking Latency with ping

Latency is the bane of any VoIP call because of all the problems it causes if it is too high. A quick way to check your current latency is to use the ever-handy ping, so try this!

1\.   Run ping on some known source, such as www.microsoft.com or www.totalsem.com.

2\.   When the ping finishes, take note of the average round-trip time at the bottom of the screen. This is your current latency to that site.

Poor VoIP Call Quality

When the main symptom users are reporting is poor VoIP quality, you may need to draw on your knowledge of multiple problems to find a fix. Many VoIP providers have a dashboard where you can log in and see call statistics. The dashboard may not answer your exact question, but most dashboards usually have some kind of call-quality metric (as shown in Figure 21-49) that you can quickly check for signs of obvious trouble.

Figure 21-49  Call quality metric in GoTo Administration Panel

Here are a few things to keep in mind if you need to dig deeper:

-   Most VoIP problems could be on the other end of the call. Before you jump into diagnosing your own network, see if calls to other locations and networks have the same problem.

-   If your organization uses standalone VoIP phones, it's a good idea to see if swapping the phone out for another fixes the issue.

-   If the conversation has long delays that are making it hard to communicate, check for high latency.

-   If the audio is choppy or distorted, check for jitter. (Some VoIP providers track this for you.)

-   If the audio quality is really low, look into whether the network is congested or just doesn't have enough bandwidth.

-   Networks often need to use QoS to avoid VoIP call-quality issues---especially when the network is busy---so each of these call-quality problems might indicate that QoS isn't enabled or working correctly. Ensure your router supports QoS and that it's enabled on your router and/or VoIP router. If it's enabled, you may need to tune the settings to prioritize VoIP traffic.

CHAPTER 22

Virtualization

In this chapter, you will learn how to

-   Explain why virtualization is so highly adopted

-   Describe the service layers and architectures, and characteristics of cloud computing

The subject of this chapter, virtualization, can be a little slippery and hard to understand. A big reason is that virtualization isn't one concrete thing you can grab with your hands. There are many kinds of virtualization, and the thread tying them together isn't very obvious---it's just an idea.

The important idea at the heart of every kind of virtualization is to take an existing component (anything in or attached to the system) and make it more flexible by replacing it with a layer of software that (as far as anything interacting with the component can tell) behaves the same. This idea is so fundamental to modern computing that, way back in Chapter 4, we looked at a well-known application of it: virtual memory.

Once upon a time, computer programs had direct access to the system's RAM. Programs in modern systems actually access virtual memory---a layer of software that, as far as the program can tell, is RAM. Operating systems use the extra flexibility this layer of software provides to store the memory contents of active programs in RAM but swap the memory contents of idle programs out to a storage drive.

To virtualize something is to replace it with this more flexible layer of software. Why do we virtualize things? The answer is almost always because the extra flexibility enables us to do something new, makes things easier to manage, or both.

This chapter delves into virtualization in detail, starting with the reasons why virtualization is important today, and then looking at a collection of technologies that use virtualization extensively: cloud computing. Let's get started.

1101

Hardware Virtualization

One of the most important kinds of virtualization, hardware virtualization, takes the entire computer that an OS expects to interact with and virtualizes it. The physical host computer uses software known as a hypervisor to create environments (each saved in a separate file) that have virtual versions of all the "hardware" devices you need to install and run an OS. The hypervisor allocates fractions of the host's real hardware resources to power these virtual devices.

EXAM TIP   For clarity, I will specify what kind of virtualization I mean and only use the term "virtualization" by itself to refer to the broader idea. If you see "virtualization" by itself on the exam, however, it will almost certainly mean hardware virtualization!

These environments are called virtual machines (VMs) or guests. Figure 22-1 shows one such example: a Windows host system using a hypervisor called Hyper-V to run two guest virtual machines, one running Ubuntu Linux and another running Windows 10.

Figure 22-1  Hyper-V running Linux and Windows 10

The CompTIA A+ 1101 objectives expect you to be able to summarize the purpose of virtual machines. We'll build up to the list of purposes CompTIA has in mind by the end of this section, but first I want to get philosophical so that we don't lose sight of something.

Just as a hammer is a tool for the purpose of hitting things, a computer is a tool for the purpose of computing things. Virtualizing a computer doesn't change this---the purpose of a virtual machine is still to run computations! The benefits of hardware virtualization are to make virtual machines more convenient than physical computers in some situations, but they are just another tool we can use to meet a need or solve a problem.

Let's take a closer look how we can use hardware virtualization on our own local systems, and then address the elephant in the room---what are the benefits of virtual computers and what on Earth can you do with them? Then, I'll walk you through the process of setting up a VM of your own to experiment with, and finish the section with a look at how hardware virtualization tends to manifest on a server.

Client-side Virtualization

A normal operating system installed directly on the hardware uses programming called a supervisor (better known as the kernel) to handle very low-level interaction among hardware and software, such as task scheduling, allotment of time and resources, and so on. Figure 22-2 shows how the supervisor works between the OS and the hardware.

Figure 22-2  Supervisor on a generic single system

Hardware virtualization enables one machine---the host---to run multiple guest operating systems simultaneously. The CompTIA A+ 1101 objectives focus mostly on what CompTIA calls client-side virtualization---when the VM host also serves as someone's day-to-day workstation.

EXAM TIP   If you see the words "client-side" and "virtualization" in the same question on the exam, keep an open mind! As a term, "client-side virtualization" is vague. It refers to where the work is done---usually in contrast to server-side virtualization---and omits what kind of virtualization it is. I think CompTIA means client-side hardware virtualization, but CompTIA might mean client-side desktop virtualization. We'll discuss desktop virtualization later in the chapter.

In hardware virtualization, the hypervisor takes on the role of the supervisor---plus the added chore of dividing up the hardware resources among active virtual machines. Figure 22-3 shows a single hypervisor hosting three different guest virtual machines.

Figure 22-3  Hypervisor on a generic single system hosting three virtual machines

There are a fair number of hypervisors to choose from. Microsoft's Hyper-V (shown earlier in Figure 22-1) is included in Windows Server and Windows Pro. Another very popular hypervisor is Oracle VM VirtualBox (see Figure 22-4), which runs on Windows, macOS, and Linux.

Figure 22-4  Oracle VM VirtualBox

This is in no way a complete list. Many Linux users swear by KVM, for example, and VMware has long made a number of popular commercial hypervisors.

Benefits of Virtualization

One of the tricks to getting your mind around any given kind of virtualization is understanding why anyone bothers---what benefits are they getting from the extra flexibility? Hardware virtualization unlocks a lot of little benefits, so I'll focus on two big categories: saving resources and making systems easier to manage.

Saving Resources

A dirty little secret of modern life is that most people have things they almost never use---and big organizations are no different! When it comes to resource use, most computers and cars have a lot in common: they spend most of the time just sitting there, a little time partly occupied, and are only rarely used to their full capacity.

Before hardware virtualization, each OS needed a physical system. With a hypervisor, though, you can place multiple virtual servers or clients on a single physical system. Rather than one machine running a Windows file server, another Windows system acting as a DNS server, and a third machine running Linux for a DHCP server, why not use one physical computer to handle all three servers simultaneously as virtual machines?

The flexibility of virtual machines makes it possible to consolidate multiple systems down into a single box. Every physical computer requires a minimum amount of hardware, and a lot of that hardware---like its fans, power supply, and motherboard---require a minimum amount of electricity just to turn on. When organizations reduce the number of physical systems they need to do the same amount of work, they benefit from ongoing energy savings (see Figure 22-5).

Figure 22-5  Hardware virtualization saves power.

Lowering your energy bill is great, but it's just where the benefits start. Hardware consolidation reduces the time and money an organization spends maintaining hardware and enables it to entirely avoid purchasing expensive hardware that rarely if ever runs at full capacity during its useful lifetime.

These benefits are biggest for servers, but they also apply to desktop computers. A Windows user who needs regular access to Linux doesn't need two computers or a complex multi-boot setup---they just need a Windows hypervisor and a Linux VM. Likewise, support techs who need occasional access to every OS version they support can have a single system with a VM for each.

Complex desktop PCs can also be replaced with simple but durable thin clients that offload most of their work on servers. Each thin client still needs a keyboard, mouse, and monitor---but they may not need hard drives or fans. They can usually get away with simpler motherboards and less-powerful CPUs, GPUs (which can be built into the CPUs), and RAM.

Simplifying System Management and Security

The most popular reason for virtualizing is probably the benefits we reap from easy-to-manage systems. We can take advantage of the fact that VMs are simply files: like any other files, they are easy to copy around. It's easy to set up new employees with a department-specific virtual machine that has all of the software they need already installed.

These management advantages turn out to be a nice security advantage, too. Let's say you have set up a new employee with a traditional physical system. If that system goes down---due to hacking, malware, or so on---you need to restore the system from a backup (which may or may not be easily at hand) or break out the OS installation media. With hardware virtualization, the host machine, hypervisor, and any other VMs it runs are generally unaffected and uninfected; you merely need to shut down the virtual machine and reload an alternate (clean) copy of it. And because VMs are just files, these are easy to keep around.

TIP   VMs on a network face the same risks---and pose the same risks to other networked devices---as any other networked computer. Networked VMs have security requirements similar to a physical system and should usually get whatever security treatment you'd give physical systems. VMs need regular OS and software updates, firewalls, anti-malware software, accounts with strong passwords, backups, and good general security hygiene.

Most virtual machines also let us make a snapshot or checkpoint, which saves the virtual machine's state at that moment, allowing us to quickly return to this state later. Snapshots are great for doing risky (or even not-so-risky) maintenance with a safety net. They also give you the freedom to install updates without worrying they'll render the OS unusable, making it easier to keep systems secure. These aren't, however, a long-term backup strategy---each snapshot may reduce performance and should be removed as soon as the danger has passed. Figure 22-6 shows VMware ESXi saving a snapshot.

Figure 22-6  Saving a snapshot

TIP   Virtualized operating systems use the same security features as real operating systems. For each virtual machine user account, you'll need to keep track of user names, passwords, permissions, and so on, just like on a normal PC.

Purpose of Virtual Machines

As I said earlier: like physical computers, virtual machines are just another tool for computing things. This means you can find people using virtual machines to do almost anything they can do with physical computers. It also means you'll find people using physical computers for things virtual machines do well.

Above all else, it means that---just like with physical computers---people are constantly finding new ways to use virtual machines. Let's review the list of purposes you should know for the CompTIA A+ 1101 exam---but keep in mind that the best problem you ever solve with a VM may not be on this list!

Sandboxing

We'll take a closer look at security topics in Chapter 27, so for now I just want to touch lightly on a fundamental idea. If you need to run software that you don't trust, the safest way to do it is to run it on a separate computer where it can't interact with real data and programs.

Isolating untrusted software this well is rarely practical, so the next-best thing is to run the software inside a tightly restricted execution environment---a sandbox---which limits how the software can interact with the host system and any files and other programs on it. CompTIA wants you to know that virtual machines can serve as a sandbox---but I need to split a few hairs.

First, there are many kinds of sandbox. One of the most common types is for keeping applications from interfering with each other in day-to-day use. These generally come with the operating system and are especially important on smartphones. Another type enables you to occasionally run untrusted software in an environment that is isolated from the core system---a good example is Windows Sandbox, included in Windows 10 Pro and newer. There are also sandboxes designed from the ground up for analyzing the behavior and safety of software you run inside them.

Second, a general virtual machine is not a true sandbox. It is not designed to isolate software! As a tool, virtual machines just happen to be useful for this task; they are better than running sketchy software on the host, but not perfectly safe.

NOTE   If you need to isolate the software for boring reasons---imagine you need to run multiple versions of a program but can't install more than one on a system---a VM is just fine (though it will consume a lot of resources).

Development Testing

When it comes to programming, there's always a chance that differences between systems will cause the software that developers are working on to run differently---or not at all! For this reason, developers often test the software they are writing in a development environment that matches the intended environment (i.e., where the software should run) as closely as possible. Virtual machines are a popular choice for these environments.

EXAM TIP   The CompTIA A+ 1101 objectives call this purpose test development. I think CompTIA means "test" as a verb---to test development work. But there's a chance CompTIA means "development" as the verb---to develop tests. Know that VMs are a popular way to test development work and look for "VM" in the answers if you see a question about creating or developing tests.

It isn't enough to just use any VM, though. Surprisingly small differences between systems can cause trouble. Not only are two systems set up by hand likely to differ, but differences accumulate on every system as users install different software in them, run updates at different times, create different files, and so on. Developers may regularly run special software to prepare a fresh VM---to provision it with the exact operating system, files, and software specified in configuration files shared among everyone working on the project.

Application Virtualization

The final purpose of VMs that CompTIA focuses on is application virtualization. Application virtualization entails virtualizing the OS capabilities that an application would normally use to install and do its work. The flexibility this creates enables some neat tricks, such as being able to run an application without installing it, run applications that only work in a different version of your OS, run applications that would normally interfere with each other, and even run applications that were written for another OS entirely.

EXAM TIP   The CompTIA A+ 1101 objectives call out two of these tricks: running applications for a different OS version (identified as legacy software/OS), and running applications written for another OS (identified as cross-platform virtualization). Look for "application virtualization" or "virtual machines" as an answer to questions about running applications for a different or older OS.

I need to be clear about two things here. First, there are different approaches to application virtualization out there and they don't all use virtual machines. Second, you can manually use virtual machines to accomplish these same tricks, but application virtualization means more than just running an application in a VM. The point is to have your cake and eat it, too.

Here's an example of application virtualization. Having to run a full Windows 7 VM to access a legacy app on macOS is clunky. Users must jump through hoops to move files around between the host system and the VM, and they'll almost certainly catch themselves trying to use macOS keyboard shortcuts inside the Windows VM or Windows keyboard shortcuts outside of it.

In contrast, some forms of application virtualization are so seamless that users will launch it just like any other native desktop app and not even know they are interacting with old software written for Windows 7.

Creating a Virtual Machine

Before we go any further, let's take the basic pieces you've learned about hardware virtualization and put them together in one of its simplest forms: a virtual machine on your local system.

The basic process for creating virtual machines is as follows:

1\.   Set up your system's hardware to support virtual machines and verify it can meet the resource requirements for running them.

2\.   Install a hypervisor on your system.

3\.   Create a new virtual machine that has the proper virtualized hardware requirements for the guest OS.

4\.   Start the new virtual machine and install the new guest OS exactly as you'd install it on a new physical machine.

Hardware Support and Resource Requirements

While any computer running Linux, Windows, or macOS will support a hypervisor, there are a few hardware requirements we need to address.

Every Intel-based CPU since the late 1980s is designed to support a supervisor for multitasking, but it's hard work for that same CPU to support multiple supervisors on multiple VMs. Both AMD and Intel added extra features to their CPUs just to support hypervisors: Intel's VT-x and AMD's AMD-V. This is hardware virtualization support, and VMs will run better with it enabled.

If your CPU and BIOS support hardware virtualization, you can turn it on or off inside the system setup utility (it may or may not be enabled by default). Figure 22-7 shows the virtualization setting in a typical system setup utility. Note that AMD's AMD-V virtualization is often referred to as SVM mode, as shown in Figure 22-7.

Figure 22-7  BIOS setting for CPU hardware virtualization support on an AMD-based system

RAM  The most important concern is RAM. Each virtual machine needs just as much RAM as a physical one, so it's common practice to stuff your host machine with large amounts of RAM. The more virtual machines you run, the more RAM you need. Generally, you need to leave enough RAM (4 GB recommended) for the hypervisor and every VM you intend to run simultaneously.

NOTE   As we discussed way back in Chapter 4, different motherboards can support different quantities of RAM. If you plan to build a PC to run virtual machines, it pays to do your research. You don't want to get stuck with a board that maxes out at 16 GB of RAM.

VM Storage  VM files can be huge because they include everything installed on the VM. Depending on the OS and how the VM is used, the VM file could range from megabytes to hundreds of gigabytes. On top of that, every snapshot or checkpoint you make requires space. Figure 22-8 shows a newly minted Windows 10 VM taking about 10 GB of storage space.

Figure 22-8  Single VM file taking about 10 GB

The particulars of VM storage depend on your circumstances, but here are a few basic recommendations:

-   Make sure you have plenty of storage space for all of the VMs you plan to have, and room to grow.

-   Your VM files are precious. Plan ahead to protect them with good RAID arrays and regular backups to make sure they are available when you need them.

-   If performance is critical for your VMs, plan to store them on an SSD.

Virtual Networks

Probably one of the coolest features of VMs is that you can "virtually" network them in many different ways. Don't just limit yourself to thinking, "Oh, can I get a VM to connect to the Internet?" Well, sure you can, but hypervisors do so much more. Every hypervisor has the capability to connect each of its virtual machines to a network in a number of different ways. All of these options depend on virtual switches, but the way this looks will vary a lot from hypervisor to hypervisor.

Some common ways to network VMs include the following:

-   Create an internal network (see Figure 22-9) for multiple VMs within the same hypervisor, enabling them to communicate with each other (and optionally the outside world).

Figure 22-9  Configuring a VM for an internal network in VirtualBox

-   Place a VM on a virtual network that only enables it to communicate with the host system.

-   "Bridge" a VM's NIC to the host's NIC, enabling the VM to join the same network that the host computer is connected to.

-   Provide a VM with no network, isolating it from other VMs, the host, and the broader network.

Installing a Virtual Machine

The actual process of installing a hypervisor is usually no more complicated than installing any other type of software. Let's use Hyper-V as an example. If you have a Windows 10 or 11 Professional system, you can enable Microsoft's Hyper-V by going to the Programs and Features Control Panel applet and selecting Turn Windows features on or off, which opens the Windows Features dialog box, as shown in Figure 22-10.

Figure 22-10  Installing Hyper-V in Windows

NOTE   If you are using Windows 10/11 Home, Hyper-V is not available from this menu. Use a third-party virtualization tool.

Once you've installed the hypervisor of choice, you'll have a virtual machine manager (VMM) that acts as the primary place to create, start, stop, save, and delete guest virtual machines. Figure 22-11 shows the manager for VirtualBox.

Figure 22-11  Oracle VM VirtualBox Manager (three VMs installed)

How to Build a Virtual Machine

Now that you've got a hypervisor, you can set up a virtual machine. On pretty much any virtual machine manager, this is simply a matter of selecting New | Virtual Machine, which starts a wizard to ensure you're creating the right virtual machine for your guest OS. Most hypervisors have presets for crucial settings (such as virtual RAM, storage space, and so on) to ensure your guest OS has the virtual hardware it needs to run. Figure 22-12 shows the VirtualBox wizard asking what OS you intend to install in the Machine Folder field. You also need to give the virtual machine a name. For this overview I'm going with Fedora Workstation.

Figure 22-12  Creating a new VM in Oracle VirtualBox

NOTE   Use descriptive names for virtual machines. This will spare you a lot of confusion when you have multiple VMs on a single host.

Click Next, and you get to pick how much memory you want for your VM (see Figure 22-13). VirtualBox recommends at least 1 GB for Fedora, but I'm going with 2 GB.

Figure 22-13  Selecting the amount of memory for the VM

After clicking Next, you get to create the virtual hard drive. Clicking Create opens the Create Virtual Hard Disk wizard, which asks several technical questions about hard disk file type and how it should allocate the space. I'm just going with the defaults, but it can be useful to change them in certain situations. Finally, on the last screen, you get to set how big the virtual disk will be, the default being 8 GB. That's a bit small for me, so I've gone with 25 GB, as shown in Figure 22-14. With that, you've created a new virtual machine.

Figure 22-14  Setting the virtual drive size

Installing the Operating System

Once you've created the new guest VM, it's time to install a guest operating system. Would you like to use Microsoft Windows in your virtual machine? No problem, but every Windows virtual machine requires a separate, legal copy of Windows; this also goes for any licensed software installed in the VM.

All good virtual machine managers enable you to load installation media from removable media on the host, but the easy way is to tell the new virtual machine to treat an ISO file as its own optical drive. In Figure 22-15, I'm installing Fedora Workstation on a VirtualBox virtual machine. I downloaded an ISO image from the Fedora Web site (https://getfedora.org) and selected it as the installation media. From here I click Start and install Fedora like any other installation.

Figure 22-15  Selecting the installation media

After you've gone through all the configuration and OS installation screens, you can start using your virtual machine. Figure 22-16 shows VirtualBox running the newly installed Fedora Workstation.

Figure 22-16  Fedora Workstation running in VirtualBox

Like with a real system, you can add or remove hardware---but adding hardware won't take a trip to the electronics store or a box from Newegg. With a good hypervisor, you can easily add and remove virtual hard drives, virtual network cards, virtual RAM, and so on, helping you adapt your VM to meet changing needs. Figure 22-17 shows the Settings System screen from VirtualBox.

Figure 22-17  Configuring virtual hardware in VirtualBox

Server-side Virtualization

When it comes to servers, hardware virtualization has pretty much taken over everywhere. Many of the servers we access, such as those that power Web sites and video streaming services, are virtualized. These severs usually aren't running in a desktop hypervisor such as VirtualBox because that type of hypervisor requires the host to have a full operating system.

This full host OS not only ties up at least enough resources to run a full VM---it also adds a little overhead to every operation. For this reason (and others), most server VMs run on a powerful hypervisor/OS combination called a bare-metal hypervisor. We call it bare metal because there's no other software between it and the hardware---just bare metal. The industry also refers to this class of hypervisors as Type-1, and applications such as VirtualBox as Type-2 (see Figure 22-18).

Figure 22-18  Type-1 versus Type-2 hypervisors

I hope by this point that you have a sense of what hardware virtualization is---but don't worry if you're still a bit confused about why it's a big deal. One hurdle to understanding how and why virtualization is continually revolutionizing IT is that the flexibility it creates is often most helpful at very large scales (like data centers with tens of thousands of servers) that aren't familiar to most people. In the next section, we'll see how this flexibility plays out on a massive scale.

To the Cloud

Before we look at what "the cloud" is, I want to take a step back and talk about something that will sound unrelated: money. One of the really great things money does is give us common, easily divisible units we can exchange for the goods and services we need. When we don't have money, we have to trade goods and services to get it, and before money was invented, humans had to trade goods and services for other goods and services.

Let's say I'm starving and all I have is a hammer, and you just so happen to have a chicken. I offer to build you something with my hammer, but all you really want is a hammer of your own. This might sound like a match made in heaven, but what if my hammer is actually worth at least five chickens, and you just have one? I can't give you a fifth of a hammer, and once I trade the hammer for your chicken, I can't use it to build anything else. I have to choose between going without food and wasting most of my hammer's value. If only my hammer was money!

In the same vein, a top-of-the-line physical server can be a bit like a really expensive hammer. It has the resources to do a lot of work, but it is often underused because you would have to find tasks in which to take advantage of its various resources. Installing a hypervisor on this server sets us on the path to using it in a new, more productive way.

In this new model, servers become (a little) less like hammers and (a little) more like money. I still can't trade a fifth of my hammer for a chicken, but a powerful physical server has the flexibility to host one huge VM, two large VMs, or one large VM and a dozen tiny ones---and this configuration can change constantly!

As the number of VM hosts and guest VMs increases, so do the options for distributing VMs across hosts to minimize unused resources (see Figure 22-19). At larger scales, the hosts become more and more like a pool of common, easily divisible units we can use to solve problems---more and more like money.

Figure 22-19  No vacancy on these hosts

Many organizations use this flexibility to make their own data centers more efficient, but its most impressive use is in the services offered by massive cloud computing providers. These companies cobble together massive pools of computing resources from data centers all around the world.

When we talk about the cloud, we're talking not just about friendly file-storage services like Dropbox or Google Drive, but about all of the services that enable us to dip into the vast pools of computing resources sold by Amazon (see Figure 22-20), Microsoft, and many other companies over the open Internet. The technology at the heart of these innovative services is virtualization (and they apply it to far more than just virtual servers).

Figure 22-20  Amazon Web Services Management Console

The Service-Layer Cake

Service is the key to understanding the cloud. At the hardware level, we'd have trouble telling the difference between the cloud and the servers and networks that comprise the Internet as a whole. We use the servers and networks of the cloud through layers of software that add great value to the underlying hardware by making it simple to perform complex tasks or manage powerful hardware. As end users we generally interact with just the sweet software icing of the service-layer cake---Web applications like Dropbox, Gmail, and Facebook, which have been built atop it. The rest of the cake exists largely to support Web applications like these and their developers. Let's slice it open (see Figure 22-21) and start at the bottom.

Figure 22-21  A tasty three-layer cake

Infrastructure as a Service

Large-scale global Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) providers use hardware virtualization to minimize idle hardware, protect against data loss and downtime, and respond to spikes in demand. We can use big IaaS providers like Amazon Web Services (AWS) to launch new virtual servers using an operating system of choice on demand (see Figure 22-22) for pennies an hour. The beauty of IaaS is that you no longer need to purchase expensive, heavy hardware. You are using Amazon's powerful infrastructure as a service.

Figure 22-22  Creating an instance on AWS

A huge number of Web sites are really more easily understood if you use the term Web applications. If you want to access Mike Meyers' videos, you go to https://hub.totalsem.com. This Web site is really an application that you use to watch videos, practice simulation questions, and so forth. This Web application is a great tool, but as more people access the application, we often need to add more capacity so you won't yell at us for a slow server. Luckily, our application is designed to run distributed across multiple servers. If we need more servers, we just add as many more virtual servers as we need. But even this is just scratching the surface. AWS provides many of the services needed to drive popular, complex Web applications---unlimited data storage (see Figure 22-23), database servers, caching, media hosting, and more---all billed by usage.

Figure 22-23  Amazon Simple Storage Service (S3)

The hitch is that, while we're no longer responsible for the hardware, we are still responsible for configuring and maintaining the operating system and software of any virtual machines we create. This can mean we have a lot of flexibility to tune it for our needs, but it also requires knowledge of the underlying OS and time to manage it. If you want someone to handle the infrastructure, the operating system, and everything else (except your application), you need to move up to Platform as a Service (PaaS).

Platform as a Service

Web applications are built by programmers. Programmers do one thing really well: they program. The problem for programmers is that a Web application needs a lot more than just a programmer. Developing a Web application requires people to manage the infrastructure: system administrators, database administrators, general network support, and so on. A Web application also needs more than just hardware and an operating system. It needs development tools, monitoring tools, database tools, and potentially hundreds of other tools and services. Getting a Web application up and running is a big job.

A Platform as a Service (PaaS) provider gives programmers all the tools they need to deploy, administer, and maintain a Web application. The PaaS provider starts with some form of infrastructure, which could be provided by an IaaS, and on top of that infrastructure the provider builds a platform: a complete deployment and management system to handle every aspect of a Web application.

The important point of PaaS is that the infrastructure underneath the PaaS is largely invisible to the developer. The PaaS provider is aware of their infrastructure, but the developer cannot control it directly, and doesn't need to think about its complexity. As far as the programmer is concerned, the PaaS is just a place to deploy and run his or her application.

Heroku, one of the earliest PaaS providers, creates a simple interface on top of the IaaS offerings of AWS, further reducing the complexity of developing and scaling Web applications. Heroku's management console (see Figure 22-24) enables developers to increase or decrease the capacity of an application with a single slider, or easily set up add-ons that add a database, monitor logs, track performance, and more. It could take days for a tech or developer unfamiliar with the software and services to install, configure, and integrate a set of these services with a running application; PaaS providers help cut this down to minutes or hours.

Figure 22-24  Heroku's management console

Software as a Service

Software as a Service (SaaS) sits at the top layer of the cake. SaaS shows up in a number of ways, but the best examples are the Web applications we just discussed. Some Web applications, such as Total Seminars Training Hub, charge for access. Other Web applications, like Google Maps, are offered for free. Users of these Web applications don't own this software; you don't get an installation DVD, nor is it something you can download once and keep using. If you want to use a Web application, you must get on the Internet and access the site. While this may seem like a disadvantage at first, the SaaS model provides access to necessary applications wherever you have an Internet connection, often without having to carry data with you or regularly update software. At the enterprise level, the subscription model of many SaaS providers makes it easier to budget and keep hundreds or thousands of computers up to date (see Figure 22-25).

Figure 22-25  SaaS versus updating every desktop

The challenge to defining SaaS perfectly is an argument that almost anything you access on the Internet could be called SaaS. A decade ago we would've called the Google search engine a Web site, but it provides a service (search) that you do not own and that you must access on the Internet. If you're on the Internet, you're arguably always using SaaS.

It isn't all icing, though. In exchange for the flexibility of using public, third-party SaaS, you often have to trade strict control of your data. Security might not be crucial when someone uses Google Drive to draft a blog post, but many companies are concerned about sensitive intellectual property or business secrets traveling through untrusted networks and being stored on servers they don't control.

EXAM TIP   Know the differences between basic cloud concepts such as SaaS, IaaS, and PaaS.

Ownership and Access

Security concerns like those just discussed don't mean organizations have to forfeit all of the advantages of cloud computing, but they do make their management think hard about the trade-offs between cost, control, customization, and privacy. Some organizations also have unique capacity, performance, or other needs no existing cloud provider can meet. Each organization makes its own decisions about these trade-offs, but the result is usually a cloud network that can be described as public, private, community, or hybrid.

Public Cloud

Most folks usually just interact with a public cloud, a term used to describe software, platforms, and infrastructure delivered through networks that the general public can use. When we talk about the cloud, this is what we mean. Out on the open, public Internet, cloud services and applications can collaborate in ways that make it easier to think of them collectively as the cloud than as many public clouds. The public doesn't own this cloud---the hardware is often owned by companies like Amazon, Google, and Microsoft---but there's nothing to stop a company like Netflix from building its Web application atop the IaaS offerings of all three of these companies at once.

Private Cloud

If a business wants some of the flexibility of the cloud, needs complete ownership of its data, and can afford both, it can build an internal cloud the business actually owns---a private cloud. A security-minded company with enough resources could build an internal IaaS network in an onsite data center. Departments within the company could create and destroy virtual machines as needed and develop SaaS to meet collaboration, planning, or task and time management needs all without sending the data over the open Internet. A company with these needs but without the space or knowledge to build and maintain a private cloud can also contract a third party to maintain or host it.

Community Cloud

While a community center is usually a public gathering place for those in the community it serves, a community cloud is more like a private cloud paid for and used by more than one organization. Community clouds aren't run by a city or state for citizens' use; the community in this case is a group of organizations with similar goals or needs. If you're a military contractor working on classified projects, wouldn't it be nice to share the burden of defending your cloud against sophisticated attackers sponsored by foreign states with other military and intelligence contractors?

Hybrid Cloud

Sometimes we can have our cake and eat it too. Not all data is crucial, and not every document is a secret. Needs that an organization can only meet in-house might be less important than keeping an application running when demand exceeds what it can handle onsite. We can build a hybrid cloud by connecting some combination of public, private, and community clouds, allowing communication between them. Using a hybrid cloud model can mean not having to maintain a private cloud powerful enough to meet peak demand---an application can grow into a public cloud instead of grind to a halt, a technique called cloud bursting.

But a hybrid cloud isn't just about letting one Web application span two types of cloud---it's also about integrating services across them. Let's take a look at how Jimmy could use a hybrid cloud to expand his business.

EXAM TIP   Know the differences between public, private, community, and hybrid cloud models.

Jimmy runs a national chain of sandwich shops and is looking into drone-delivered lunch. He'll need a new application in his private cloud to calculate routes and track drones, and that application will have to integrate with the existing order-tracking application in his private cloud. But then he'll also need to integrate it with a third-party weather application in the public cloud to avoid sending drones out in a blizzard, and a flight-plan application running in a community cloud to avoid other drones, helicopters, and aircraft (and vice versa). The sum of these integrated services and applications is the hybrid cloud that will power Jimmy's drone-delivered lunch.

Cloud Characteristics

When it comes to whether and how to make use of cloud computing, every organization has to weigh the positives and negatives of the cloud against a more traditional approach. Different organizations will care about different things, but let's take a moment to discuss five cloud characteristics that CompTIA wants you to know for the exam.

Shared Resources

Cloud computing focuses less on individual physical systems and more on the underlying resources. Instead of renting out each physical unit separately, cloud providers aggregate them into a pool of shared resources that they make available on-demand. The provider's customers draw from this pool as they need additional resources and release them back into the pool when they are done.

This flexibility is one of the cloud's big strengths. For example, this makes it practical to spin up tons of resources to render special-effects animations for an upcoming movie and release the resources once the job's done. Unfortunately, this also means jobs for other users are likely running on the same hardware---and that's not always acceptable.

Most cloud neighbors are fine, but you never know! There's always a chance that a cloud neighbor could be intentionally exploiting a weakness in the host system to spy on their neighbors, could get hacked or infected with malware, or could overuse shared resources in a way that hinders performance for everyone else.

Rapid Elasticity

Let's say you start a new Web application. If you use an IaaS provider such as Amazon, you can start with a single server and get your new Web application out there. But what happens if your application gets really, really popular? No problem! Using AWS features, you can easily expand the number of servers, even spread them out geographically, with just a click of the switch. This capability is known as rapid elasticity.

Metered Utilization

Ah, the biggest downside to using someone else's cloud: you have to write a check to whoever is doing the work for you---and boy can these cloud providers get creative about how to charge you! In many cases they charge a precise metered utilization rate based on factors such as the traffic that goes in and out of your Web application and how much data you store. In other cases you pay for the exact amount of time that every single one of your virtualized servers is running.

Regardless of how costs are measured, this differs from more traditional hosting with a fixed monthly or yearly fee. You pay for what resources you use, rather than a more general fee for all the hardware of a system.

High Availability

For every small organization with a single physical server doing some critical job 24 hours a day, there's a tech who doesn't sleep well at night. All kinds of problems can knock a single system out of commission for hours or days, and many organizations can't justify the cost of hiring someone to keep an eye on the server closet all night just in case.

Large cloud providers, however, have an army of automated systems and technicians perpetually watching over their global network of data centers. This already reduces the odds of an extended outage, enabling many cloud providers to promise that most of their services will be available 99.9 percent of the time or more.

Cloud computing enables organizations to get as close to 100 percent uptime as they can afford. Sometimes this is as simple as paying the cloud provider extra for a service to guarantee greater uptime. Organizations can also design their cloud deployments for high availability---for example, they can set up redundant servers all around the world and automatically reroute traffic whenever a server is down.

NOTE   High availability isn't limited to the cloud---it is a huge topic in its own right! If you continue on to take the CompTIA Network+ exam, you'll learn more about how important high availability is in networking and data centers.

File Synchronization

Cloud file storage services, like Dropbox and Box, were early smash successes in getting people to move to the cloud for some of their storage needs. Most of these services provide file synchronization apps that propagate file changes to the storage provider on to any other connected devices. Synchronization apps make it easy to access the same set of files across multiple devices.

These days, file synchronization is often bundled with productivity suites (i.e., collections of apps that enable you to edit documents, spreadsheets, presentations, and so on) such as Microsoft 365 and Google Workspaces. Regardless of how your organization approaches it, file synchronization makes it easier for users to collaborate or work on the same files from multiple devices without having to shuffle files around.

Unfortunately, cloud-based file synchronization also means giving up a lot of control over the organization's files to the provider. It also makes it easier for disgruntled users to pass documents on to people who shouldn't have access to them.

Desktop Virtualization

Desktop virtualization tries to apply the flexibility associated with both hardware virtualization and cloud computing to user workstations. The most common forms of desktop virtualization entail using a client program on one device to connect to a virtual desktop, providing access to a user's files and applications.

If each human user still needs a system to access their virtual desktop, why would an organization be eager to also set aside server resources for them? Some of the big reasons are control, security, and management. Every user walking around with a laptop stuffed to the gills with sensitive organization data and applications is a huge risk! Desktop virtualization enables users to access the apps and files they need without storing them on local devices that could get lost or stolen at any time.

Some folks do desktop virtualization with just a remote desktop client and a user account on a multiuser OS such as Windows Server. The CompTIA A+ 1101 objectives focus on a form called virtual desktop infrastructure (VDI), in which each user's client program connects to an automatically managed virtual machine running on a central server. In many organizations these VDI servers will be on premises, but it's also possible to set up VDI servers in the cloud.

NOTE   CompTIA didn't include cloud-based Desktop as a Service (DaaS) in the 1101 objectives, but any organization considering cloud-based VDI will likely consider using DaaS as well. They both accomplish roughly the same goal, but differ when it comes to cost, licensing, control, flexibility, and management.

Portable Computing

In this chapter, you will learn how to

-   Manage and maintain portable computers

-   Upgrade and repair portable computers

-   Troubleshoot portable computers

There are times when the walls close in, when you need a change of scenery to get that elusive spark that inspires greatness . . . or sometimes you just need to get away from your coworkers for a few hours because they're driving you nuts! For many occupations, that's difficult to do. You need access to your documents and spreadsheets; you can't function without e-mail or the Internet. In short, you need a computer to get your job done.

Portable computing devices combine mobility with accessibility to bring you the best of both worlds; portables enable you to take some or even all of your computing capabilities with you when you go. Featuring all the bells and whistles of a desktop system, many portables offer a seamless transition from desk to café table.

This chapter looks at the classic portable computer, essentially a desktop transformed into a mobile format. Classic portables usually run the same operating systems as their desktop counterparts---Windows, macOS, or Linux. However there are some operating systems---like Chrome OS, based on Linux---that are unique to portable computers.

Historical/Conceptual

Portable Computing Devices

All portable devices share certain features. For output, they use LCD screens, although these vary from 20-inch behemoths to diminutive 10-inch displays. Portable computing devices employ sound of varying quality, from bland mono playback to fairly nice faux-surround reproductions. All of them run on DC electricity stored in batteries when not plugged into an AC outlet.

When asked about portable computing devices, most folks describe the traditional clamshell notebook computer, such as the one shown in Figure 23-1, with built-in LCD monitor, keyboard, and input device (a trackpad, in this case). The notebook is also called a portable or a laptop. All the terms are synonymous. A typical laptop functions as a fully standalone computer, but there are always trade-offs that come with portability. Common trade-offs are price, weight, size, battery life, computing power, input devices, ports, drives, support for hardware upgrades, storage capacity, durability, and the quality of any warranty/support programs. Finding the right portable is easier if you can figure out what it will be used for and narrow your search to only devices with essential features and exclude those with unacceptable trade-offs.

Taxonomy

The companies making mobile and portable devices experiment a lot, so the terms we use to describe these devices are always in flux. New device categories and their related marketing terms may flood the market and blur the lines between existing categories one year, only to fall out of use within a few years.

The CompTIA A+ objectives don't focus on these terms and categories, but it's still a good idea to keep up with them. Knowing how to categorize portable and mobile devices makes it easier to identify devices that are a good fit for specific uses. It also helps you apply the best troubleshooting procedures for a given device. These categories can be slippery, so don't think of them as mutually exclusive. Sometimes more than one of these terms apply to a single device.

Portable vs. Mobile

Over the years, the lines between portable computing devices such as laptops and mobile devices such as smartphones have blurred. Smartphones have become more powerful, laptops have incorporated touch screens and smaller form factors, and many tablets allow the use of external keyboards and mice. Despite these blurred lines, portable computing devices and mobile devices are separate concepts, with unique use cases and applications. A good rule of thumb is to look at the operating system that the device uses. If it uses the same operating system as its desktop counterparts, it is a portable device. If it uses a dedicated mobile operating system like Android, iOS, or iPadOS, it is a mobile device.

Types of Laptops

There are many terms that address the size or purpose of traditional clamshell laptops/notebooks, but over time, a lot of these distinctions have become less important. As the technology has been developed, use cases for many laptops have started to overlap. Terms like ultrabook, thin and light, and business laptop are mostly for marketing at this point, because apart from the examples I'm about to mention, laptops in general are a lot thinner, lighter, and more powerful than they were when many of these terms were coined (see Figure 23-2).

Figure 23-2  Older full-size laptop (left) versus the thin-slice aesthetic of the MacBook Air (right)

-   Gaming laptops, which tend to have flashy designs, typically come loaded with the latest top-end processors, graphics cards, RAM, SSDs, and large, high-quality displays. They also tend to come with thoughtful touches like RGB lighting.

-   A Chromebook is a portable computer running Google's Linux-based Chrome OS. Chrome OS is a proprietary Linux-based operating system developed by Google. Thanks to Chrome OS, Chromebooks offer an experience focused on Web applications by making use of virtually unlimited data storage in the cloud and Software as a Service (SaaS) applications available over the Web. Using primarily cloud-based applications and storage allows users to get by with less powerful hardware, and as a result saves on cost. Because they offload so much work, Chromebooks have a reputation for being cheap and light, but premium Chromebooks are increasingly common.

-   2-in-1s are touch-screen computers somewhere along the spectrum from laptop-and-tablet to tablet-and-laptop. We'll take a closer look at pure mobile tablets (such as the Apple iPad and various Android tablets) in Chapter 24. Some 2-in-1s have removable screens that separate from the rest of the laptop to function as a tablet (see Figure 23-3). Others have special hinges that enable you to fold the entire device up and use it in tablet form. 2-in-1s are also sometimes referred to as convertibles or hybrids.

Figure 23-3  Microsoft Surface Pro 6 with its keyboard cover (Used with permission from Microsoft)

NOTE   Innovative portable form factors like those in the 2-in-1 category are often designed to be handled, rotated, flipped, and passed around. As a result, Windows now supports the automatic screen-rotation tricks we've seen on smartphones and tablets for years. Anyone who has used a device like this for long knows that occasionally you'll run into problems with the automatic screen-orientation sensor; see the "Troubleshooting Portable Computers" section later in the chapter for fixes.

1101

Input Devices

Portable computers come with a variety of input devices. Most have a fully functional keyboard and a device to control the mouse pointer.

Keyboard Quirks

Laptop keyboards differ somewhat from those of desktop computers, primarily because manufacturers have to cram all the keys onto a smaller form factor. They use the QWERTY format, but manufacturers make choices with key size and placement of the non-alphabet characters.

Almost every portable keyboard uses a Function (FN) key to enable some keys to perform an extra duty. You'll either hold the FN key to access the extra function, or you'll hold it to access the traditional function (the latter is more common with extra functions on the F1--F12 keys). On some systems, you can also configure this behavior. Figure 23-4 compares a laptop keyboard with a standard desktop keyboard. Note that the former has no separate number pad on the right and is a more compact layout.

Figure 23-4  Keyboard comparison

Pointing Devices

Portables need a way to control your mouse pointer, but their smaller size requires manufacturers to come up with clever solutions. Beyond the built-in solutions, portables usually have USB ports and can use every type of pointing device you'd see on a desktop. Early portables used trackballs, often plugged in like a mouse and clipped to the side of the case. Other models with trackballs placed them in front of the keyboard at the edge of the case nearest the user, or behind the keyboard at the edge nearest the screen.

NOTE   The FN key also enables you to toggle other features specific to a portable, such as GPS tracking or the keyboard backlight, to save battery life.

The next wave to hit the laptop market was IBM's TrackPoint device, a joystick the size of a pencil eraser, situated in the center of the keyboard (see Figure 23-5). With the TrackPoint, you can move the pointer around without taking your fingers away from the "home" typing position. You use a forefinger to push the joystick around, and then click or right-click, using two buttons below the spacebar. This type of pointing device has since been licensed for use by other manufacturers, and while it continues to appear on some business-focused laptops today, it has primarily been replaced by our next link in the pointing device chain.

Figure 23-5  IBM TrackPoint

By far the most common laptop pointing device found today is the trackpad (see Figure 23-6)---a flat, touch-sensitive pad just in front of the keyboard. To operate a trackpad, you simply glide your finger across its surface to move the pointer and tap or press the surface once or twice to single- or double-click. You can also click by using buttons just below the pad on some older devices. Most people get the hang of this technique after just a few minutes of practice. The main advantage of the trackpad over previous laptop pointing devices is that it uses few moving parts---a fact that can really extend the life of a hard-working laptop.

Figure 23-6  Trackpad on a laptop

EXAM TIP   Use the Settings | Devices | Mouse dialog box or the Mouse applet in Control Panel for trackpad configuration. You can change sensitivity and much more in either tool.

Many manufacturers today include a multitouch trackpad that enables you to perform gestures, or actions with multiple fingers, such as scrolling up and down or swiping to another screen or desktop. The Multi-Touch trackpad on Apple's laptops pioneered such great improvements to the laptop-pointing-device experience that the lack of a mouse is no longer a handicap on many laptops.

TIP   In the past it was common to accidentally "use" a trackpad with your palm while typing, so you may find some devices with a hardware switch or FN key combination for disabling the trackpad. More recent trackpads are usually capable of detecting and ignoring accidental input like this on their own.

Continuing the trend of mobile's influence on more traditional portables, a number of laptops come equipped with a touch screen like you would find on a smartphone or tablet, again relying heavily on gestures to enable users to fluidly perform complex actions. In some cases these are otherwise very traditional laptops that happen to include a touch screen, but in other cases they are devices that are intended to be used as both a tablet and a laptop. Many of these touch screens are designed to take advantage of dedicated touch pens, also known as a stylus. These pens enable users to be more precise with their touch-screen interactions, hand write notes, draw, and keep the screen free of fingerprints. We'll take a closer look at touch screens when we discuss mobile devices in Chapter 24.

Webcams and Microphones

The ability to communicate with others through real-time video is such a common expectation of mobile and portable devices these days that most of these devices (including laptops) come equipped with some sort of front-facing video camera---a webcam in the case of laptops---and one or more built-in microphones. A single microphone may be suitable for picking up the user's voice, and additional microphones can help noise-cancellation routines improve the audio quality.

Even though most of us may just use the microphone in conjunction with the webcam, a growing number of programs support voice commands. Microsoft, for example, promotes its Cortana functionality built into Windows 10 (and optionally added to Windows 11). Any Windows 10 or 11 user on a system with a microphone, as long as they can live with letting Windows listen in on them, can perform voice searches and other actions from anywhere within earshot (mic-shot?) of their device.

The downside of these input devices becoming ubiquitous is the security risk they pose. It might be bad enough if a nefarious hacker or government agency (from any country) managed to get malware into my computer to see everything I click or type, but the risks are amplified if they can also hear and see anything going on near the device. It's common enough for webcams to include a light that indicates when they're recording, but built-in microphones don't do the same. In some cases, vulnerabilities allow the recording indicator to be disabled anyway.

Display Types

Laptops come in a variety of sizes and at varying costs. One major contributor to the overall cost of a laptop is the size of the LCD screen. Most laptops offer a range between 10.1-inch to 17.3-inch screens (measured diagonally), while a few offer just over 20-inch screens.

In the past, 4:3 aspect ratio screens were common, but these days it's hard to find one on anything but special-purpose or ruggedized laptops; almost all regular laptops come in one of two widescreen format ratios. Aspect ratio is the comparison of the screen width to the screen height, as you'll recall from Chapter 17. While widescreens can have varying aspect ratios, almost all of the screens you find in present-day laptops will be 16:9 or 16:10.

EXAM TIP   Laptop LCDs are the same in almost every way as desktop LCDs with a TFT screen and a LED backlight (add an inverter and swap in a CCFL backlight for older laptops). You know all about these screens from Chapter 17. Expect questions about laptop displays but know that they're pretty much the same as desktop displays. The only major difference is that the LCD frame contains an antenna, and may contain a camera and microphone, but we'll discuss this later in the chapter.

Laptop screens typically come with one of two types of finish: matte or high-gloss. The matte finish was the industry standard for many years and offered a good trade-off between color richness and glare reduction. The better screens have a wide viewing angle and decent response time. The major drawback for matte-finished laptop screens is that they wash out a lot in bright light. Using such a laptop at an outdoor café, for example, can be very difficult without a bright enough display.

Manufacturers released high-gloss laptop screens more than a decade ago, and they rapidly took over many store shelves. The high-gloss finish offers sharper contrast, richer colors, and wider viewing angles when compared to the matte screens. The drawback to the high-gloss screens is that, contrary to what the manufacturers claim, they pick up lots of reflection from nearby objects, including the user! So, although they're usable outside during the day, you'll need to contend with increased reflection as well. Higher-end laptops include various anti-reflective solutions to mitigate this issue, with varying degrees of success.

With the advent of LED backlighting for LCD panels, many manufacturers have switched back to an anti-glare screen, though they're not quite the matte screens of old. When the LED brightness is up high, these are lovely screens. (See the "Troubleshooting Portable Computers" section, later in this chapter, for issues specific to LED-backlit portables.)

As with other LCD technologies that you'll recall from Chapter 17, most LCD/LED screens initially used twisted nematic (TN) technology. Most modern laptop screens use in-plane switching (IPS) panels for the greater viewing angle and better color quality. You'll mostly find TN panels on older portables.

EXAM TIP   You may recall from Chapter 17 that there is another LCD panel type, vertical alignment (VA). While you're very unlikely to encounter a VA panel on a laptop, it is possible and CompTIA may ask about one on the A+ 1101 exam. Just be aware that while they are uncommon for laptops, it isn't impossible.

Organic light-emitting diode (OLED) displays are becoming more common on laptops (originally, due to their cost, they were limited primarily to large desktop monitors and TVs). OLED screens sip energy when compared to LCDs, and while less expensive and more common than they used to be, you'll mostly find them on smartphones and tablets today. Chapter 24 discusses OLED screen technology.

EXAM TIP   The CompTIA A+ 1101 exam objectives may refer to OLED displays for laptops. Manufacturers were slow to incorporate OLED display technology in laptops, but OLED displays have gradually seen more adoption in recent years, particularly on higher-end devices. You may not see many in the wild yet, but know they exist for the exam!

Extending Portable Computers

In the dark ages of mobile computing, you had to shell out top dollar for any device that would operate unplugged, and what you purchased was what you got. Upgrade a laptop? Connect to external devices? You had few if any options, so you simply paid for a device that would be way behind the technology curve within a year and functionally obsolete within two.

Portable computers today offer a few ways to enhance their capabilities. Most feature external ports that enable you to add completely new functions, such as attaching a scanner, mobile printer, or both. You can take advantage of the latest wireless technology breakthrough simply by slipping a card into the appropriate slot on the laptop.

I'll first describe single-function ports, and then turn to networking options. Next, I'll cover card slots, and then finish with a discussion of general-purpose ports.

Single-Function Ports

All portable computers come with one or more single-function ports. You'd have a hard time finding a portable computing device that doesn't have an audio jack, for example. Laptops often provide a video port for hooking up an external monitor, though wireless screen sharing and screencasting are gaining popularity as an alternative.

NOTE   Some laptop manufacturers, in a quest to make increasingly thinner and lighter devices, have moved away from including single-function ports like HDMI. Not only have they done away with most single-function ports, but they have also removed some common general-purpose ports like USB-A, in favor of a smaller number of USB-C or Thunderbolt ports. This port deficiency is often compensated for with a USB-C dongle, replacing on-board ports with optional expansion instead.

Ports work the same way on portable computers as they do on desktop models. You plug in a device to a particular port and, as long as the operating system has the proper drivers, you will have a functioning device when you boot.

Audio

Most portable computers have a 3.5-mm audio jack that is used for audio-out. This jack is quite often a combined headset jack that also supports microphone-in on the same three-ring plug. Older laptops might have a similarly sized microphone-in jack (see Figure 23-7), though built-in microphones are most common. You can plug in headphones, regular PC speakers, or even a nice surround sound setup to enable the laptop to play music just as well as a desktop computer can.

Figure 23-7  3.5-mm audio jacks

You can control the sound (both out and in) through the appropriate Settings app area or Control Panel applet in Windows, System Preferences in macOS, or some kind of switches on the laptop. The portable shown in Figure 23-8, for example, enables you to mute the speakers by pressing a special mute button above the keyboard. Other portables use a combination of the FN key and another key to toggle mute on and off, as well as to play, pause, fast-forward, and rewind audio (or any other media options). Most portables have volume up/down controls in the same location.

Figure 23-8  The mute button on a laptop

As Bluetooth wireless headphones have increased in popularity, some laptop manufacturers have excluded a dedicated 3.5-mm audio jack altogether. This isn't a common or particularly popular move, but if you encounter a portable device with no dedicated audio jacks, don't be surprised, because you heard about it here first.

Display

Most laptops support a second monitor via a digital port of some sort. There are many of these---you may find HDMI (including Mini-HDMI and Micro-HDMI) or DisplayPort (including USB Type-C and Thunderbolt); on ancient or special-purpose portables, there's even a chance you may still find a VGA or DVI port. With a second monitor attached, you can duplicate your screen to the new monitor, or extend your desktop across both displays, letting you move windows between them. Not all portables can do all variations, but they're more common than not.

Most portables use the FN key plus another key on the keyboard to cycle through display options. To engage the second monitor or to cycle through the modes, hold the FN key and press F8 (see Figure 23-9).

Figure 23-9  Laptop keyboard showing Function (FN) key that enables you to access additional key options, as on the F8 key

NOTE   Although many laptops use the Function key method to cycle the monitor selections, that's not always the case. You might have to pop into Settings to do so. Just be assured that if the laptop has a video output port, you can cycle through monitor choices!

You can control what the external monitor shows by adjusting your operating system's display settings. In Windows 10/11, this is all contained in the Display area of the Settings app. Open the Settings app and navigate to System | Display; from there scroll down till you find the Multiple displays section (see Figure 23-10). You'll see a drop-down menu with several options. Extend these displays makes your desktop encompass both the laptop and the external monitor. Duplicate these displays places the same thing on both displays. You'd duplicate these displays for a presentation, for example, rather than for a workspace.

Figure 23-10  Multiple-display options menu in Windows 10

Near-Field Scanner

It isn't really a port, but you'll find some portable computers---especially ones designed for and marketed to business users---with a very thin slot the width of a credit card on one side or the other. No, it isn't an expansion or memory card slot---it's a smart card reader. If you've seen a credit or debit card with a little metallic chip (see Figure 23-11), you've seen a smart card. Smart card readers make use of a near-field scanner. While smart cards have tons of uses, what matters here is that you can log in to a portable device (if it has a built-in or USB smart card reader) using your smart card and a PIN number. We'll go into a little more detail on the use of smart cards for authentication in Chapter 27.

Figure 23-11  Smart card

Networking Options

Rarely will you find a portable computer without at least one network connection option. Today's portables come with some combination of 802.11, Bluetooth, and wired Ethernet connections. Generally they work exactly as you've seen in previous chapters, but you may stumble into a few issues that are unique to portables. (Mobile devices---tablets, smartphones---have even more options, as you'll see in Chapter 24.)

802.11 Wireless

Most portables today have Wi-Fi built directly into the chipset for connecting the device to a wireless access point (WAP) and from there to a bigger network, such as the Internet. The 802.11n standard is common on older laptops; newer portable computers use 802.11ac (Wi-Fi 5) or 802.11ax (Wi-Fi 6).

NOTE   While the newest portables are shipping with 802.11ax, which is backward compatible with older standards, be aware that, especially as portables are getting powerful enough to live longer useful lives, you may see a few previous standards built into devices in the wild.

Bluetooth

802.11 isn't the only wireless technology commonly found in portable devices. Nearly all modern portables use Bluetooth as well. Bluetooth is really handy on a laptop because, as you may recall from Chapter 20, it enables you to add wireless peripherals such as mice, keyboards, and headsets, as well as communicate with smartphones, speakers, and other Bluetooth devices.

Hardware Switches

Portable computers that come with wireless technologies such as 802.11, mobile broadband, GPS, or Bluetooth have some form of on/off switch to toggle the antenna off or on so that you may use the laptop in areas where emissions aren't allowed (like a commercial aircraft, hence the term "airplane mode"). The switch may be hardwired on older devices, like the one shown in Figure 23-12, or if you're using a more modern machine, will be a toggle of the FN key plus another key on the keyboard. Also, if you're not using Wi-Fi or Bluetooth, turn them off to save some electricity and lengthen the portable's battery life.

Figure 23-12  Wireless switch

EXAM TIP   Hardware switches or special Function key toggles enable you to switch features on and off, such as wireless networking, cellular networking, and Bluetooth. Toggle them off when in a scenario where battery life takes priority over networking.

Wired Ethernet

Some full-size laptops have an RJ45 wired Ethernet connection like the one shown in Figure 23-13. These work exactly like any other Ethernet jack---they have link lights and connect via UTP cable. Be aware, however, that wired Ethernet is one of the things many smaller contemporary laptops leave out.

Figure 23-13  Ethernet port on laptop

There are two issues with RJ45s on laptops. First, they do not have an on/off switch like the 802.11 and Bluetooth connections. You can turn them off just like you would turn off the NIC on a desktop: disable the NIC in Device Manager or turn the NIC off in BIOS. The other issue is the relative weakness of the physical connection. If you ever plug a laptop into a wired network and the OS doesn't see a connection, check the RJ45 port.

Portable-Specific Expansion Slots

The makers of portable computers have developed methods for you to add features to a portable via specialized connections known generically as expansion slots. For many years, the Personal Computer Memory Card International Association (PCMCIA) established standards involving portable computers, especially when it came to expansion cards and slots. Once a common feature on laptops, these specialized expansion slots are almost impossible to find due to the dominance of USB. The last standard was called ExpressCard.

Storage Card Slots

Many portable computers offer one or more flash memory card slots to enable you to add storage to the portable. Particularly popular with photographers and videographers, these slots also enable the fast transfer of data from the card to the portable, and vice versa. They come in the standard varieties that you already know from Chapter 10, such as SD or microSD.

General-Purpose Ports

Portable computers rarely come with all of the hardware you want. Today's laptops usually include at least USB-A or USB-C ports to give you the option to add more hardware. A few special-purpose laptops may still provide legacy general-purpose expansion ports (PS/2, RS-232 serial ports, eSATA, FireWire, and so on) for installing peripheral hardware, but these are increasingly less common. Most portables focus on more modern ports like USB-C or Thunderbolt. If you're lucky, you will have a docking station or port replicator so you don't have to plug in all of your peripheral devices one at a time.

USB and Thunderbolt

Universal serial bus (USB) and Thunderbolt enable users to connect a device while the computer is running---you won't have to reboot the system to install a new peripheral. With USB and Thunderbolt, just plug in the device and go! Because portables don't have a desktop's multiple internal expansion capabilities, USB and Thunderbolt are some of the more popular methods for attaching peripherals to laptops and other portables (see Figure 23-14). Keeping with the trend toward fewer and more standardized general-purpose ports, many modern laptop manufacturers design their devices to charge using USB-C rather than the older AC adapters or more proprietary solutions.

Figure 23-14  Devices attached to USB on a portable PC

Docking Stations

Docking stations offer legacy and modern single- and multifunction ports (see Figure 23-15). The traditional docking station uses a proprietary connection, though the high speeds of USB 3.x and Thunderbolt 3 and 4 have made universal docks more common. A docking station makes an excellent companion to small portables with fewer ports.

Figure 23-15  Docking station

Port Replicators

A port replicator supplies one of the most critical aspects of docking stations, but in a smaller, more portable format: support for connectors that the laptop lacks. A modern USB Type-C port replicator, for example, will plug into a laptop's USB-C port and offer an array of other port types, such as VGA, HDMI, USB Type-A (2, 3, 3.1), RJ45, and more. Port replicators work great with ultra-light, ultra-thin laptops to enhance the capabilities of the machine.

Smaller port replicators are also often referred to as dongles or USB-C dongles. Modern port replicators support something called pass-through charging, enabling the user to connect their charger to the port replicator. Be careful, because sometimes a port replicator won't allow enough power through to the laptop, which can lead to slow charging, or even losing charge while plugged in.

EXAM TIP   Over time, the lines between docking station, port replicator, and dongle have blurred, and you'll hear the terms used interchangeably in the IT world. Nonetheless, there are distinctions between docking stations and port replicators. A docking station is an external device that attaches to a mobile computer or other device, has a power connection, and allows connections to peripherals such as a keyboard and a mouse. It usually also includes slots for memory cards, optical disc drives, and other devices. Docking stations are perfect for professionals who need their work desk while traveling. A port replicator is an external device that provides connections to peripherals through ports. They are also perfect for travelers who just need to access email and communicate with others. Keep these differences in mind when you're taking the CompTIA A+ exam.

USB Adapters

When you don't need access to a number of ports at once, you can often find a USB adapter for whatever you need to connect. When it comes to drives or connectors that you need only occasionally, these adapters can enable you to use a much more portable device.

Two great examples of this are wired Ethernet and optical drives. I don't know about you, but I haven't spun up an optical disc in months, nor am I sure when I last opened my laptop within a few feet of a wired Ethernet connection. A USB to Ethernet (RJ45) dongle and a USB optical drive can provide these features when and where I need them, leaving me a much smaller laptop to carry the rest of the time.

Another good use for USB adapters is updating connectivity support for older devices. A USB to Wi-Fi dongle or a USB Bluetooth adapter can let me update an old laptop to 802.11ax, or add Bluetooth to a laptop that didn't come with it built in.

EXAM TIP   The CompTIA A+ 1101 exam expects you to be familiar with USB to Ethernet adapters.

Managing and Maintaining Portable Computers

Most portables come from the factory fully assembled and configured. From a tech's standpoint, your most common work on managing and maintaining portables involves taking care of the batteries and extending the battery life through proper power management, keeping the machine clean, and avoiding excessive heat.

Everything you normally do to maintain a computer applies to portable computers. You need to keep current on OS updates and use stable, recent drivers. Use appropriate tools to monitor the health of your storage drives and clean up unwanted files. That said, let's look at issues specifically involving portables, with one caveat: because more compact or hybrid portables are often built like mobile devices, you may need to approach those devices by combining steps mentioned here with troubleshooting ideas from Chapter 25.

Batteries

Manufacturers over the years have used a few types of batteries for portable computers: Nickel-Cadmium (Ni-Cd), Nickel-Metal Hydride (Ni-MH), and Lithium-Ion (Li-Ion). Today, only Li-Ion is used because that battery chemistry provides the highest energy density for the weight and has few problems with external factors.

The Care and Feeding of Batteries

In general, keep in mind the following basics. First, always store batteries in a cool place. Although a freezer might seem like an excellent storage place, the moisture, extreme freezing cold, metal racks, and food make it a bad idea. Second, keep the battery charged, at least to 70--80 percent. Many modern laptops include optimized charging features that can prevent your battery from charging over a certain percentage while it's plugged in, and in some cases, like with modern MacBooks, even learn your charging routine and adjust itself accordingly. Third, never drain a battery all the way down unless required to do so as part of a battery calibration (where you, in essence, reset the battery according to steps provided by the manufacturer). Rechargeable batteries have only a limited number of charge-discharge cycles before overall battery performance is reduced. Fourth, never handle a battery that has ruptured or broken; battery chemicals are very dangerous and flammable (check YouTube for videos of what happens when you puncture a Li-Ion battery). Finally, always recycle old batteries.

Try This!

Recycling Old Portable Device Batteries

Got an old portable device battery lying around? Well, you need to get rid of it, and there are some pretty toxic chemicals in that battery, so you can't just throw it in the trash. Sooner or later, you'll probably need to deal with such a battery, so try this!

1\.   Do an online search to find the battery recycling center nearest to you. Electronics retailers are getting much better about accepting a wide array of e-waste, including batteries, though they may place quantity limits.

2\.   Sometimes, you can take old laptop batteries to an auto parts store that disposes of old car batteries---I know it sounds odd, but it's true! See if you can find one in your area that will do this.

3\.   Many cities offer a hazardous materials disposal or recycling service. Check to see if and how your local government will help you dispose of your old batteries.

Power Management

Many different parts are included in the typical laptop, and each part uses power. The problem with early laptops was that every one of these parts used power continuously, whether or not the system needed the device at that time. For example, the hard drive continued to spin even when it was not being accessed, the CPU ran at full speed even when the system was doing light work, and the LCD panel continued to display even when the user walked away from the machine.

Over the years, a lot of work has gone into improving the battery life of portable devices. Beyond engineering better batteries and ever-more-efficient components, the system firmware and OS of most modern portables collaborate with the firmware of individual components to manage their power use. To reduce power use, the computer can power off unused components until they are needed, enter a low-power mode when the device isn't in use, and throttle the performance of power-hungry components like the CPU to fit the current workload. This process of cooperation among the hardware, BIOS, and OS to reduce power use is known generically as power management.

Low-Power Modes

If you don't know what's going on under the hood, computers usually appear to be clearly off or on. In reality, most computers (both desktops and portables!) that appear to be off are using at least a little power, and may be in one of a few low-power modes. The CompTIA A+ 220-1102 exam focuses on configuring basic power options in the Windows Control Panel, but it's good to have a handle on low-power modes in general.

NOTE   Low-power mode names can differ from OS to OS (and even from version to version), but the basic concepts are the same.

When the computer is off, turning it on will boot the OS from scratch. You can think of there being two kinds of true off mode:

-   Mechanical off mode The system and all components, with the exception of the real-time clock (RTC), are off.

-   Soft power-off mode The system is mostly off except for components necessary for the keyboard, LAN, or USB devices to wake the system.

Computers that appear to be off may actually be in a sleep (also called standby or suspend) mode: waking them will resume any programs, processes, and windows that were open when they entered the low-power mode. There are a number of fine-grained sleep modes, but the highlights are:

-   A device can wake quickly from normal sleep mode (sometimes called suspend to RAM) because it doesn't power down the RAM, enabling the system to save its place. If the device loses power unexpectedly, it can lose whatever was in RAM.

-   Devices wake more slowly from a deeper sleep mode called hibernate (or suspend to disk) because they save everything in RAM to a hard drive or SSD (and restoring it all takes a moment) before powering down. On the up side, hibernation saves more power and won't lose its place if the device loses power.

Configuring Power Options

You configure power options via the system setup utility or through the operating system. OS settings override CMOS settings. Implementations differ, but certain settings apply generally, like the ability to enable or disable power management; configure which devices can wake the system; configure what the power button does; and configure what the system should do when power is restored after an outage.

Operating systems tend to use friendly terms like Energy Options or Power Options, but you might run into some more technical terms in a system configuration utility. Many CMOS versions present settings to determine wake-up events, such as directing the system to monitor a modem or a NIC. You'll see this feature as Wake on LAN, or something similar.

In Windows, power options can be found in the Settings | System | Power & sleep | in Windows 10/11 and the Control Panel applet Power Options. Windows offers power plans that enable better control over power use by customizing a Balanced, Power saver, or High performance power plan (see Figure 23-16).

Figure 23-16  Windows 10 Balanced, Power saver, and High performance power plan options

NOTE   While you can customize most laptops' power plans to your heart's content, on some models, such as Microsoft's Surface Pro line, you are restricted to just the default Balanced plan.

You can customize a power plan for your laptop, for example, and configure it to turn off the display at a certain time interval while on battery versus plugged in or configure it to put the computer to sleep (see Figure 23-17). To see the specific power plans, click Additional power settings or go directly to the Control Panel Power Options applet. There you can tweak a lot more, including choices like hibernation (see Figure 23-18).

Figure 23-17  Customizing a laptop power plan in Windows 10

Figure 23-18  Windows 10 hibernation settings in the Power Options applet

Manual Control over Power Use

Most portables give you several manual options for reducing battery use in certain circumstances. We've already discussed using the on/off switch or keyboard combinations for disabling the Wi-Fi antenna or shutting off Bluetooth, but many modern portables borrow a feature from smartphones and tablets for disabling most or all of their wireless components at once: airplane mode. Beyond its intended use, airplane mode is also a great way to disable power-sucking components quickly. On the flipside, some newer gaming laptops include something known as a MUX switch, which enables a user to disable the computer's integrated graphics in favor of the dedicated graphics card, which increases performance, but decreases battery life significantly.

Try This!

Adjusting Your System's Power Management

Go into the Power Options applet on a Windows computer and look at the various settings. What is the current power plan for the computer? Check to see if it is running a Balanced or High performance power plan. If it is, change the power plan to Power saver and click Change plan settings. Familiarize yourself with some of the advanced power settings (click the Change advanced power settings link).

Try changing the individual settings for each power scheme. For instance, set a new value for the Turn off the display setting---try making your display turn off after five minutes. Don't worry; you aren't going to hurt anything if you fiddle with these settings.

Note that Microsoft changed power settings for laptops in Windows 10 to be Balanced. You can still adjust advanced power settings and tweak everything.

Laptops with backlit keyboards or RGB lighting will have some way you can disable this feature when it's not needed, usually with a keyboard combination. You can also reduce the output of the LCD backlight using a combination of FN and another key to eke out a few more precious minutes of computing time before you have to shut down. Figure 23-19 shows a close-up of the FN-activated keys for adjusting screen brightness.

Figure 23-19  Keys for adjusting screen brightness

One of the best ways to conserve battery is to plan ahead for times when you'll be unplugged. This can mean a lot of different things in practice, but they all boil down to thinking of ways to minimize the number of programs and hardware devices/radios you'll need to use while your laptop is running on battery power. When I travel, for example, and know that I'm going to need a certain set of files stored on my file server at the office, I put those files on my laptop before I leave, while it's still plugged into the AC. It's tempting to throw the files on a thumb drive so I don't have to break out my laptop at the office, or to let Dropbox do my syncing for me when I get to a Wi-Fi hotspot, but both USB and Wi-Fi use electricity.

Better than that, Windows enables me to designate the files and folders I need as offline files, storing a local, duplicate copy of the files and folders on my hard drive. When I connect my laptop to my office network, those offline files are automatically synced with the files and folders on the file server. Anything I changed on the laptop gets written to the server. Anything anyone changed in those folders on the server gets written to my laptop. If changes were made on both sides, a sync conflict pops up automatically, enabling me to resolve problems without fear of overwriting anything important.

To designate a folder and its contents as offline files, right-click the folder you want and select Always available offline from the context menu. The sync will occur and you're done. When you want to open the files offline, go to the Control Panel and open the Sync Center applet (see Figure 23-20). Click the Manage offline files link to open the Offline Files dialog box (see Figure 23-21). Click the View your offline files button and you're in.

Figure 23-20  Sync Center applet

Figure 23-21  Offline Files dialog box

EXAM TIP   Another option for extending battery life is to bring a spare battery. While most modern laptops don't have easily swappable batteries, larger power banks enable you to charge your laptop on the go, much like you'd do with your smartphone.

Cleaning

Most portable computers take substantially more abuse than a corresponding desktop model. Constant handling, travel, airport food on the run, and so on can radically shorten the life of a portable if you don't take action. One of the most important things you should do is clean the device regularly. Use an appropriate screen cleaner (not a glass cleaner!) to remove fingerprints and dust from the fragile LCD panel. (Refer to Chapter 17 for specifics.) Using a dedicated screen cleaner is important, otherwise you run the risk of doing permanent damage to the display.

We'll go into greater detail on environmental threats in Chapter 27, but if you've had the portable in a smoky or dusty environment where air quality alone can cause problems, try cleaning it with compressed air. Compressed air works great for blowing out dust and crumbs from the keyboard and for keeping any ports, slots, and sockets clear. Don't use water on your keyboard! Even a little moisture inside the portable can toast a component.

Heat

To manage and maintain a healthy portable computer, you need to deal with heat issues. Every portable has a stack of electronic components crammed into a very small space. Unlike their desktop brethren, portables don't have lots of freely moving air space that enables fans to cool everything down. Even with lots of low-power-consumption devices inside, portable computers crank out a good deal of heat. Excessive heat can cause system lockups and hardware failures, so you should handle the issue wisely.

The following steps have more traditional portables in mind; very compact portables are usually designed to handle heat more like mobile devices; in some cases, such as the newer MacBook Air, this is even accomplished without fans. Chapter 25 will approach heat issues with mobile device construction in mind. For more traditional portables, try this as a starter guide:

-   Use power management, even if you're plugged into the AC outlet. This is especially important if you're working in a warm (more than 80 degrees Fahrenheit) room.

-   Keep air space between the bottom of the laptop and the surface on which it rests. Putting a laptop on a soft surface, such as a pillow on your lap, creates a great heat-retention system---not a good thing! Always use a hard, flat surface.

-   Don't use a keyboard protector for extended amounts of time.

-   Listen to your fan, assuming the laptop has one. If it's often running very fast---you can tell by the whirring sound---examine your power management settings, environment, and running programs so you can change whatever is causing heat retention.

-   Speaking of fans, be alert to a fan that suddenly goes silent. Fans do fail on laptops, causing overheating and failure.

Protecting the Machine

Even midrange laptops can be pricey, and replacing them before you're ready is always a pain. To protect your investment, you'll want to adhere to certain best practices. You've already read tips in this chapter to deal with cleaning and heat, so let's look at the "portable" part of portable computers.

Tripping

Pay attention to where you run the power cord when you plug in a laptop. One of the primary causes of laptop destruction is people tripping over the power cord and knocking the laptop off of a desk. This is especially true if you plug in at a public place such as a café or airport. Remember, the life you save could be your portable's!

Storage

If you aren't going to use your portable for a while, storing it safely will go a long way toward keeping it operable when you do power it up again. A quality case is worth the extra few dollars---preferably one with ample padding. Not only will this protect your system on a daily basis when transporting it from home to office, but it will keep dust and pet hair away as well. Also, protect from battery leakage, at least on devices with removable batteries, by removing the battery if you plan to store the device for an extended time. Regardless of whether the battery is removable or built in, it's a good idea to store the battery partially charged and top it up occasionally to keep it from fully discharging.

Travel

If you travel with a laptop, guard against theft. If possible, use a case that doesn't look like a computer case. A well-padded backpack makes a great travel bag for a laptop and appears less tempting to would-be thieves, though some brands and styles of these are still quite obvious. Smaller portables can often hide in less obvious bags. Don't forget to pack any accessories you might need, like modular devices, power banks, and AC adapters. Most importantly---back up any important data before you leave!

Make sure to have at least a little battery power available. Heightened security at airports means you might have to power on your system to prove it's really a computer and not a transport case for questionable materials. And never let your laptop out of your sight. If going through an x-ray machine, request a manual search. The x-ray won't harm your computer like a metal detector would, but if the laptop gets through the line at security before you do, someone else might walk away with it. If flying, stow your laptop under the seat in front of you where you can keep an eye on it.

If you travel to a foreign country, be very careful about the electricity. North America uses ~115-V power outlets, but most of the world uses ~230-V outlets. Most portable computers have auto-switching power supplies, meaning they detect the voltage at the outlet and adjust accordingly (but most people just call it a charger). An auto-switching power supply will have an input voltage range printed on it somewhere (see Figure 23-22).

Figure 23-22  Input and output voltages on laptop power brick

Double-check the charger to make sure its supported range covers voltages used in any country you plan to visit. If it doesn't, you may need a full-blown electricity-converting device, either a step-down or step-up transformer. You should be able to find converters and transformers at electronics retailers, travel stores, and, of course, online.

Shipping

Much of the storage and travel advice can be applied to shipping. If possible, remove batteries and optical discs from their drives. Pack the portable well and disguise the container as best you can. Back up any data and verify the warranty coverage. Ship with a reputable carrier and always request a tracking number and, if possible, delivery signature. It's also worth the extra couple of bucks to pay for the shipping insurance. And when the clerk asks what's in the box, it's safer to say "electronics" rather than "a new 17-inch laptop computer."

Security

The fact is, if someone really wants to steal your laptop, they'll find a way. While we cover securing devices against physical theft in Chapter 27, there are some things you can do to make yourself, and your portable devices, less desirable targets. As you've already learned, disguise is a good idea.

Another physical deterrent is a laptop lock. Not all laptops are able to use one, but they can be helpful if the option is available for your device. Similar to a steel bicycle cable, there is a loop on one end and a lock on the other. The idea is to loop the cable around a solid object, such as a bed frame, and secure the lock to the small security hole on the side of the laptop (see Figure 23-23). Again, if someone really wants to steal your computer, they'll find a way. They'll dismantle the bed frame if they're desperate. The best protection is to be vigilant and not let the computer out of your sight.

Figure 23-23  Cable lock

An alternative to securing a laptop with a physical lock is to use a software tracking system that makes use of GPS. It won't keep your device from being taken, but tracking software can use the many sensors and networking capabilities of modern devices to help recover them. While functionality differs by application, common features include seeing the location of the stolen computer, capturing images or audio with its sensors, and wiping sensitive files from the device. Because this functionality is more common in mobile devices, we'll save the details for Chapter 25.

Theft isn't the only security risk that laptop owners face; modern laptops account for the need to protect user privacy and data as well. Screen locks have been around for a long time, requiring a user to enter a PIN or password before being able to actually use the device. In recent years, these features have been enhanced using biometrics. Biometrics are measurements of physical characteristics that are documented and verified through the use of scanners. Biometrics can be used to match a physical characteristic of a user with a valid user account in order to authenticate the user. Common biometric security features found on laptops include fingerprint scanners located on the keyboard or facial recognition software that uses the device's webcam. These are popular because they allow a user to quickly access their device without needing to enter a complex password every time they open the lid or come back from a lunch break.

Upgrading and Repairing Laptop Computers

A competent tech can upgrade and repair portable computers to a degree, though true laptop techs are specialists. Over the years, laptops have become more and more based on proprietary parts, to a point where some laptops can only really be repaired by the manufacturer or authorized third parties, and in some cases, upgrades are off the table altogether. Upgrading the basics usually means breaking out the trusty screwdriver and avoiding electrostatic discharge (ESD). Repairing portables successfully, on the other hand, requires research, patience, organization, special tools, and documentation. Plus, you need a ridiculously steady hand. This section provides an overview of the upgrade and repair process. Keep in mind that the growing number of form factors and the shrinking size of portable devices mean there are many exceptions, especially for very compact portables; these devices may be trickier to take apart, and components may be soldered on or use less-common interfaces.

Disassembly Process

Disassembling a portable PC is usually pretty easy, if it was designed to be upgraded or serviced by casual users. Putting it back together in working condition is the hard part! You need to follow a four-step process to succeed in disassembly/reassembly.

NOTE   Many modern laptops are designed with portability in mind over repairability and, as a result, are not easily repairable without access to proprietary tools or parts. In laptops like this, even components like RAM or an SSD may be soldered onto the motherboard. Nonetheless, knowing your way around the inside of a laptop is a great skill as a tech.

First, document and label every cable and screw location. Laptops don't use standard connectors or screws. Often you'll run into many tiny screws of varying threads. If you try to put a screw into the wrong hole, you could end up stripping the screw, stripping the hole, or getting the screw wedged into the wrong place.

Second, organize any parts you extract from the laptop. Seriously, put a big white piece of construction paper on your work surface, lay each extracted piece out in logical fashion, and clearly mark where each component connects and what it connects to as well. You may even want to use a smartphone camera to take pictures or a webcam to record your workspace in case something goes missing.

Third, refer to the manufacturer's resources. I can't stress this point enough. Unlike desktops, portables have no standardization of internal structure. Everything in the portable is designed according to the manufacturer's best engineering efforts. Two portables from the same manufacturer might have a similar layout inside, but it's far more likely that every model differs a lot.

Finally, you need to use the appropriate hand tools. A portable, especially on the inside, will have a remarkable variety of tiny screws that you can't remove/reinsert without tiny-headed Phillips or Torx drivers. You'll need tiny pry bars---metal and plastic---to open components. Figure 23-24 shows an entry-level toolkit for a laptop tech that you can order from iFixit (https://www.ifixit.com; more on this site in a moment). Their professional toolkit version has 70 tools, plus there's an expansion kit! Like I said at the beginning of this section, portable techs are specialists.

Figure 23-24  Bare-minimum laptop repair tools

Now that you have the official line on the disassembly process, let's get one thing clear: a lot of manufacturers don't provide access to their resources to just any tech, but only to authorized repair centers. So what do you do when faced with an unfamiliar laptop that a client brought in for repair?

You have essentially two options. First, you can find a dedicated laptop tech and refer your client to that person. If the problem is exceptionally complicated and the portable in question is mission critical, that's often the best option. If you want to tackle the problem or it looks like something you should be able to do, then you go to third-party sources: YouTube and iFixit.

Every portable computer has a specific make and model. Open up a Web browser and go to YouTube. Type in precisely what you want to do, such as "Dell XPS 13 keyboard replacement," and see what pops up (see Figure 23-25). You'll most likely get results back, especially if the laptop in question is a couple of years old. People all over the world have to deal with broken devices, so you're not alone.

Figure 23-25  YouTube search result

Once you've found the appropriate video or something that's close enough to enable the repair attempt, watch it. If it's too difficult for your skill level or requires a set of expensive tools, then fall back to step one and go find a dedicated tech. Otherwise, figure out what tools and parts you need. Parts specific to a laptop (as in that Dell keyboard in the preceding example) will need to be purchased from the manufacturer. More generic parts, like hard drives, CPUs, and so on can be purchased from Newegg (my favorite tech store) or some other online retailer.

For general tools, parts, and a lot of very detailed step-by-step instructions, I highly recommend iFixit. Billed as "Repair guides for everything, written by everyone," iFixit is built by techs like you and me who conquer a problem, document the steps, and post the details (see Figure 23-26). This means the next tech along who runs into the same problem doesn't have to reinvent the wheel. Just go to iFixit.com. The proceeds from parts and tools they sell, by the way, go toward supporting the site.

Standard Upgrades

Every CompTIA A+ tech should know how to perform the two standard upgrades to portable computers: adding RAM and replacing a hard drive. Let's go through the steps.

Upgrading RAM

Not every modern laptop has the option to upgrade RAM, but there are still plenty that do. As a result, one of the more common laptop upgrades you'll be called on to do is to add more RAM. A quick Google search of the make and model that you're working on will tell you whether or not the RAM is soldered or replaceable. If it's replaceable, you'll need to make sure you know what kind you need.

EXAM TIP   Expect a question or two on the CompTIA A+ 1101 exam about scenarios where you should install (and configure) laptop memory---as in random access memory (i.e., RAM). Adding RAM or replacing existing sticks with more RAM can dramatically improve performance.

How to Add or Replace RAM  Upgrading the RAM in a laptop requires a couple of steps. Once you've determined that the specific device you're working on can be upgraded, you need to get the correct RAM. Refer to the manufacturer's Web site or to the manual (if any) that came with the laptop for the specific RAM needed. Once you know the type, you need to make sure you know the configuration of any existing RAM in the system. If you are planning to upgrade from 8 GB to 16 GB, you need to know if your portable already has one module at 8 GB or two modules at 4 GB.

Second, every portable offers a unique challenge to the tech who wants to upgrade the RAM, because there's no standard location for RAM placement in portables. The RAM slots may not even be in the same spot. More often than not, you need to unscrew or pop open a panel on the underside of the portable or remove the entire back plate (see Figure 23-27). Then you press out on the restraining clips and the RAM stick pops up (see Figure 23-28). Gently remove the old stick of RAM and insert the new one by reversing the steps.

Figure 23-27  Removing the back plate

Figure 23-28  Releasing the RAM

Always remove all electrical power from the laptop before removing or inserting memory. Disconnect the AC cord from the wall outlet. Take out any removable batteries! Failure to disconnect from power can result in a fried laptop. In the case of systems with built-in batteries, consult the manufacturer's resources to evaluate the safety of working on the system and any additional steps or precautions you should take.

Upgrading Mass Storage

You can replace a hard disk drive (HDD) or solid-state drive (SSD) in some laptops fairly easily, while others (like MacBooks) cannot be upgraded at all. Contemporary laptops with upgradeable storage make use of the small M.2 form factor in order to save space, although a fair number of systems, particularly older ones, will also use 2.5-inch SATA drives. Using smaller form-factor drives enables manufacturers to include a second slot for easy mass storage expansion.

mSATA and M.2  If you have a newer portable, chances are the computer uses one of the smaller SSD formats---mSATA or M.2. You read about them in detail back in Chapter 8, but glance back to refresh your memory if necessary.

Most manufacturers make it fairly easy to replace or upgrade an mSATA or M.2 drive. Remove the bottom plate or dedicated drive bay covering from the computer. Remove the tiny retaining screw and pop the old drive out. Put the new drive in its place, insert the retaining screw, and reattach the covering. You're good to go, at least from the hardware side of things.

One of the best upgrades you can make on a laptop is to migrate from an HDD to an SSD. You may get less storage capacity for the money, but the trade-offs are worth it. Beyond improved reliability, the SSD will use a lot less electricity than an HDD, thus extending battery life. Additionally, any SSD is rip-roaringly faster than an HDD and performance across the board will be boosted. An upgrade from an HDD to an SSD can breathe new life into an otherwise sluggish older system.

The process of replacing a hard drive mirrors that of replacing RAM. You find the hard drive hatch---either along one edge or in a compartment on the underside of the computer---and release the screws. If the device doesn't have a hatch, you may need to remove the bottom of the chassis (as previously shown in Figure 23-27). Remove the old drive and then slide the new drive into its place (see Figure 23-29). Reattach the hatch or cover and boot the computer. If you're replacing your boot drive, grab a bootable USB flash drive and prepare to reinstall.

Figure 23-29  Inserting a replacement drive

Hardware/Device Replacement

Once you get beyond upgrading RAM and replacing a hard drive on a portable, you take the plunge into the laptop-repair specialty. You can replace some components by lifting them out, detaching a ribbon cable, and then reversing the steps with the replacement part. Other parts require a full teardown of the laptop to the bare bones, which presents a much greater magnitude of difficulty. Because every portable differs, this section provides guidance, but not concrete steps, for replacement. Be aware, as mentioned earlier, that many systems are trending toward more integrated parts; make sure the part you're replacing is actually replaceable in the specific system you're working on.

Components

Replaceable components require more work than the RAM or drive upgrades, but replacing them generally falls into the category of "doable." What I call components are the battery, keyboard, internal speaker(s), and expansion cards.

Battery  If a battery's performance falls below an acceptable level, you can replace it with a battery from the manufacturer or from an aftermarket vendor. Although this should be a simple swap replacement (and usually is, at least if the battery isn't built in), you might encounter a situation where the real problem wasn't the battery per se, but an inadequate or malfunctioning charging system. The new battery might not give you any better performance than the old one. Try it.

Keyboard  Getting a keyboard off a laptop computer often requires little pry bars, but also look for screws, clips, and so on. Keyboards connect via a tiny, short, and very delicate cable, often held down by tape. Replacing one is tricky, but doable in many cases. Look up steps for detaching and reattaching keys on a specific device if possible, and otherwise find generic instructions for the clip type before proceeding.

Speaker  Replacing the internal speaker or speakers on a laptop will most likely require you to open up the device. Most laptop speakers are inside the chassis, so if you want to replace them, you need to dismantle the portable to get to them. (See the upcoming "Integral Parts" section.)

Wireless and Expansion Cards  Many portables have one or more true expansion slots for add-on cards. The more modular varieties will have a hatch on the bottom of the case that opens like the hatch that gives you access to the RAM slot(s). This enables you to change out an older wireless cards (alternative names Wi-Fi card and WLAN card), for example, with one that support current Wi-Fi card standards, thus greatly enhancing the Wi-Fi experience on this device. Similarly, you could change out a Bluetooth module for an upgraded version. Figure 23-30 shows a wide-open laptop with the expansion slot exposed for the insertion of a WLAN card.

Figure 23-30  M.2 expansion slot on laptop with WLAN card

Just like when installing RAM in a portable, you must avoid ESD and remove all electricity before you take out or put in an expansion card. Failure to remove the battery and the AC adapter (or follow any extra steps and precautions in the manufacturer's resources if the battery is built in) can and probably will result in a shorted-out laptop motherboard, and that just makes for a bad day.

NOTE   Check with the portable manufacturer to get a Wi-Fi card that's compatible with the portable. Just because a card will fit in the slot does not, in this case, mean it will work.

The only other consideration with expansion cards applies specifically to wireless. Not only will you need to connect the card to the slot properly, but you must reattach the antenna connection and often a separate power cable. Pay attention when you remove the card as to the placement of these vital connections.

You'll find one of two types of expansion slots in a portable: Mini-PCIe and M.2. The older ones (think 2013 and earlier) use Mini-PCIe and are uncommon to see today, while newer devices use M.2.

Display and Its Components  A laptop screen presents unique challenges when faced with a replacement scenario. The display has the typical parts you'd expect in an LCD, such as the panel, backlight(s), and inverter (on older portables); plus, the display typically has other components along for the ride, such as the Wi-Fi antenna, a webcam, and a microphone. Finally, a touch-screen display offers even more of a challenge.

NOTE   For a deeper dive on the type of display technologies that exist, refer back to Chapter 17. Laptops typically make use of the same technologies that desktop monitors use, just in smaller sizes.

The process for replacing the screen (flat, touch screen, digitizer), inverter, Wi-Fi antenna, webcam, or microphone follows the same steps. You pry the plastic frame off the display, most commonly using a spudger or other tool from your toolkit, then remove any exposed screws. The screen will lift out, and you'll need to detach the internal parts. I can't give you precise details, because every model differs, but the parts are usually secured with tiny screws or compression, or mild adhesive. Plus, you'll need to gently disconnect data cables for each component. If you're just replacing a defective webcam or microphone, you won't need to disconnect other parts (most likely), but if you need to replace the screen or inverter, you'll have to remove everything.

Take pictures with your phone. Keep track of which connectors go where. Don't rush the process when dealing with so many tiny connectors and parts. Document the locations and types of screws. The extra work you do to record each step or layer will pay off with a properly repaired laptop. Trust me!

EXAM TIP   Expect a question or two on the CompTIA A+ 1101 exam on a typical scenario where replacement of the screen or components within the display needs to happen. These are obvious---cracked screen, failure of the digitizer/touch screen, Wi-Fi antenna malfunction, and so on. (Note that the specific objective language on the antenna is WiFi antenna connector/placement, which refers to the wireless antenna wires---yes, that's an oxymoron---that run along the top and sides of the display and connect with a tiny ribbon cable.) While you don't need to know the steps of the repair process for the exam, you need to at least be able to understand the differences between display components and troubleshoot issues that they may have.

Integral Parts

Some hardware replacements require you to get serious with the laptop, opening it fully to the outside, removing many delicate parts, and even stripping it down to the bare chassis. I leave these repairs to the professional laptop repair folks, simply because they have the specific tools and expertise to do the job efficiently. To understand the process, I've outlined it here. This pertains to three components: DC jack, trackpad, and system board.

NOTE   While a few laptops used to have removable/replaceable video cards, these were few and far between and you are very unlikely to encounter them in the wild. Modern devices have the GPU as part of the system board.

Portables generally open in two different ways, depending on the manufacturer. You either peel away layers from the top down, through the keyboard, or from the bottom up, through the base. Either direction requires careful attention to detail, part connectivity, and locations. You'll need a system to keep track of the dozens of tiny screws.

Every one of the replacements here requires you to detach the screen from the main chassis of the portable. Aside from finding the connection points and removing the proper screws, you need to pay attention to the connection points for the data stream to the monitor and the antenna that's in the frame of the display, as mentioned earlier.

Once you have the portable stripped down, you replace whichever component you're in there to replace and then begin the process of building it back up into a coherent unit. Pay incredibly careful attention to getting data cables connected properly as you rebuild. I can't imagine a worse tech experience than replacing a trackpad and rebuilding a laptop only to have missed a connection and having to do it all over again.

EXAM TIP   The DC jack requires extra-special love when you need to replace one. The part is soldered to the main board, so replacing it means you'll need to not only strip the laptop to the bare metal, but also unsolder the old part and solder the new part. Then you'll rebuild the laptop and hope you got everything right. CompTIA cannot expect a CompTIA A+ technician to know how to do this stuff. Expect a question that explores whether it can be done. Rest assured, specialized techs can replace any component on a laptop, even the DC jack.

Troubleshooting Portable Computers

Many of the troubleshooting techniques you learned about for desktop systems can be applied to laptops. For example, take the proper precautions before and during disassembly. Use the proper hand tools, and document, label, and organize each plastic part and screw location for reassembly. Additionally, here are some laptop-specific procedures to try.

Power and Performance

Some of the most common portable device issues relate to how well they do (or don't!) run---so let's take a look at a few issues related to power, performance, and heat.

Laptop Won't Power On

-   If a laptop won't power up---a no power scenario---verify AC power by plugging another electronic device into the wall outlet. If the other device receives power, the outlet is good.

-   If the outlet is good, connect the laptop to the wall outlet and try to power on. If no LEDs light up, you may have a bad AC adapter. Swap it out with a known-good power adapter.

-   A faulty peripheral device might keep the laptop from powering up. Remove any peripherals such as USB or Thunderbolt devices.

Poor Performance

-   The most common reason for slow performance is that a running application or process is consuming high resources. All operating systems have a utility to check this---such as the Task Manager in Windows or Activity Monitor in macOS---and look into any problems it finds. The application or process may need to be closed or stopped, you may need to reboot, or the application may need an update.

-   Extreme performance issues may lead to a frozen system. If they don't resolve on their own and you can't interact with the device, you may need to perform a hard reboot (which may result in the loss of any unsaved work). Usually, holding down the power button for 10 seconds is sufficient, though you may need to check the manufacturer's resources for the proper procedure. If the battery is removable, you may be able to reboot the device by pulling the battery out and replacing it.

NOTE   Be aware, that you might find official or third-party resources discussing hard and soft resets. These are not the same as hard and soft reboots, so you should pay careful attention to the instructions and make sure you're performing the correct procedure. See Chapter 25 for more on hard and soft resets.

Battery Issues

-   A swollen battery will probably go unnoticed at first, and the symptoms it creates may be hard to identify if you aren't aware it can happen. The cause is usually over-charging, perhaps due to a failure in the circuits that should prevent it, but the early symptoms might be a laptop that doesn't quite sit right on flat surfaces, a screen that doesn't fit flush when closed, problems with input devices like the trackpad or keyboard, and trouble removing or inserting a removable battery. Eventually, the device's case may be obviously deformed. While battery packs are designed to handle a little swelling, it increases the risk they'll puncture---and a punctured battery can be dangerous. Don't ignore these symptoms; open the case carefully to check the battery, and very carefully deliver it to an e-waste recycling or disposal site.

-   If you have a laptop with a battery that won't charge up---a poor battery health problem---it could be one of three things: The device has a setting that limits how much charge the battery can hold to preserve its lifespan, the battery might be cooked, or the AC adapter isn't doing its job, also known as improper charging. To troubleshoot, first go to the devices battery settings and look to see if there is a charge limiting setting. If there isn't, you can try removing the battery and run the laptop on AC power only. If it works, you know the AC adapter is good. If it doesn't work, you probably need to replace the adapter. Another option is to replace the battery with a known-good battery. If the new battery works, you've found the problem. Just replace the battery.

-   The reasons for very short battery life in a battery that charges properly are fairly benign. The battery has usually outlived its useful life and needs to be replaced, or some programs or hardware are drawing much more power than usual. Check wireless devices you usually keep disabled to make sure they aren't on. Follow recommendations in the preceding "Poor Performance" section to address problem programs.

Overheating

-   Because overheating can be both a symptom and a cause of a variety of issues, you should be alert to any device that is running hotter than usual. Note which parts of the device are hot---this can give you important clues. If the device feels dangerously hot, err on the side of protecting the device from heat damage instead of trying to diagnose the cause. Power the device down and remove the battery if possible. Set it on a cool, hard surface, out of direct sunlight, with the hottest part of the device exposed to air if possible.

-   Likewise, look for possible signs a device is overheating---like inconsistent reboots, graphical glitches, system beeps---and rule out heat issues.

-   Listen for fans. While some portables don't have any, complete silence may indicate a failed fan, and unusual noise may signal one on its way out. Before you open the device to check the fans, make sure that the device isn't set to some type of silent mode. Many modern laptops include software that allows you to run the laptop quietly or silently when not doing resource-intensive tasks. If this setting is active, it may be the reason for the lack of fan noise.

-   Dust build-up in the laptop can lead to major overheating issues over time. If a computer is having overheating issues, it's very possible that there is dust, pet hair, or residue from smoke gumming up the works. To fix this, you should first check the fan vents for obstructions, grab your ESD wrist strap, then open the laptop and disconnect the battery. Once this is done, use a can of compressed air to blow the dust out of the chassis using short bursts from different angles. Be careful, laptop fans can be fragile, so don't be too aggressive when you clean them.

-   Know when to expect a hot device. Busy or charging devices can create a lot of heat; follow the steps mentioned in the preceding "Poor Performance" and "Battery Issues" sections for identifying components that shouldn't be on, especially if they are hot to the touch, and finding runaway programs. If the device is charging, unplug it and see if the device cools. If you find nothing unexpected and the device is unusually hot, it may have an airflow problem.

-   If the entire device is hot, it may have simply been left in direct sunlight or a hot environment. Cool the device down and see if the trouble goes away.

Components

Various hardware components can encounter issues, including the display, wireless networking, audio, and input devices.

Display Problems

-   If the laptop is booting (you hear the beeps and the drives) but the screen doesn't come on properly---a no display problem---first, make sure the display is turned on. Press the FN key and the key to activate the screen a few times until the laptop display comes on. If the device is a 2-in-1 with a removable screen, make sure it is properly attached and that it is receiving power.

-   If the laptop display is very dim---a dim display problem---it may be as simple as adjusting the brightness settings. Most laptops allow you to do this by using the FN key and the key to adjust the brightness. If this doesn't work, it may also be due to some power saving setting. Check the power saving settings to see if the screen brightness is being limited there. If those options don't fix the problem, you may be dealing with a failing backlight. This can be caused by failed inverters on older laptops.

-   If the screen won't come on or is cracked, most laptops have a port for plugging in an external monitor, which you can use to log in to your laptop.

-   If you plug a laptop into an external monitor and that monitor does not display, remember that you have both a hardware and an OS component to making dual displays successful. There's usually a combination of FN and another key to toggle among only portable, only external, and both displays. Plus, you have the Display area of Settings or the Display in the Control Panel to mirror or extend the desktop to a second monitor.

-   If you have a flickering display, you should check for software issues before you try to open the laptop chassis. Laptop displays can flicker because of bad device drivers or application issues just like desktop displays. Unlike desktop displays, laptops are more likely to be dropped or accidentally knocked off a table. This can loosen connectors inside the display and lead to flickering as well. If software isn't the problem, loose connections just might be.

-   If the screen orientation on a Windows portable doesn't change when the device is rotated, auto-rotation may be disabled. Likewise, if the orientation changes at the wrong time, you can lock rotation in Settings, or via the Display in the Control Panel. If the rotation needs to remain locked, you can still change the orientation via Settings/Display, or possibly with FN key combinations.

Wireless Devices (Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, NFC, or GPS) Don't Work or Work Intermittently

-   If the wireless doesn't work at all, check along the front, rear, or side edges of the laptop for a physical switch that toggles the internal wireless adapter, Bluetooth adapter, or airplane mode on and off. Also check your notification area for an airplane icon.

EXAM TIP   Expect a couple of questions on the CompTIA A+ 1101 exam that explore poor/no connectivity scenarios where a client experiences issues with wireless connectivity or Bluetooth connectivity issues.

-   If a tech has recently replaced a component that required removal of the laptop display, dead wireless could mean simply a disconnected antenna. Most portables have the antenna built into the display panel, so check that connection.

-   Try the special key combination for your laptop to toggle the wireless or Bluetooth adapter, or one for toggling airplane mode. You usually press the FN key in combination with another key.

-   You might simply be out of range or, if the wireless works intermittently, right at the edge of the range. Physically walk the laptop over to the wireless router or access point to ensure there are no out-of-range issues. You might also be experiencing congestion, too many wireless devices operating in the same frequency range.

-   With Bluetooth specifically, remember that the pairing process takes action or configuration on both devices to succeed. Turn on the Bluetooth device, actively seek it, and try again.

-   If only the GPS is not functioning, privacy options may be preventing applications from accessing your GPS location information. Check the Control Panel or the Privacy section of the Settings app to see whether the GPS device is enabled, and if location services are enabled both system-wide and for the appropriate applications. Check System Preferences in macOS or a similar location in Linux for the same options.

-   While we won't discuss Near Field Communication (NFC) in depth until Chapter 24, some portable computers may have NFC support; if NFC isn't functioning, you may need to enable a setting to enable communication with nearby devices. In Windows, open the Proximity applet in the Control Panel (only present if you have NFC hardware) and make sure Proximity support is enabled.

Audio Problems

-   If audio isn't working when it should be, check for a hardware mute or volume button or switch and verify through the notification area Volume icon that the audio output isn't muted. Verify proper output device configuration through the operating system, and verify the application is using the right output device.

-   If no sound is coming from the device speakers, try plugging in a pair of headphones or some external speakers. If these work fine, there's a chance the built-in speakers have been damaged. Depending on their location, it can be easy to get them wet.

-   If the device has had repairs or upgrades lately, make sure the speakers are properly connected.

-   If headphones work fine with the device, the speakers may need replacing. First, make sure the device has been rebooted, double-check the audio output device settings, try changing and resetting the default output device, and try disabling and re-enabling the appropriate device.

Input Problems

-   Before assuming an input problem is hardware related, confirm that the system is otherwise running smoothly. Input devices may appear not to work or work erratically if the system is freezing up. Refer to the earlier "Power and Performance" section for troubleshooting a frozen system.

-   If none of the keys work on your laptop, there's a good chance you've unseated the keypad connector. These connectors are quite fragile and are prone to unseating from any physical stress on the laptop. Check the manufacturer's disassembly procedures to locate and reseat the keypad.

-   If you're getting numbers when you're expecting to get letters, the number lock (NUM LOCK) function key is turned on. Turn it off. Pay attention to the NUM LOCK indicator lights, if any, on a portable if you experience these sorts of problems.

-   Laptop keyboards take far more abuse than the typical desktop keyboard, because of all those lunch meetings and café brainstorm sessions. Eating and drinking while over or around a keyboard just begs for problems. If you have a portable with sticking keys, look for the obvious debris in the keys. Use compressed air to clean them out. If you have serious goo and need to use a cleaning solution, disconnect the keyboard from the portable first. Make sure it's fully dried out before you reconnect it or you'll short it out.

-   A laptop keyboard key that doesn't register presses or feels sticky may also have had its switch knocked out of place, especially if the key appears slightly raised or tilted. These switches can be delicate, so be careful if you want to avoid ordering replacements. Research what kind of switch your device's keyboard uses, and be aware that a single keyboard may use a few different kinds. Look up steps for detaching and reattaching keys on that specific device if possible, and otherwise find generic instructions for the clip type before proceeding.

-   If the trackpad is having problems, a shot of compressed air does wonders for cleaning pet hair out of the trackpad sensors. You might get a cleaner shot if you remove the keyboard before using the compressed air. Remember to be gentle when lifting off the keyboard and make sure to follow the manufacturer's instructions.

-   The trackpad driver might need to be reconfigured. Try the various options in the Control Panel | Mouse applet, or the equivalent location in System Preferences.

-   If the touch screen is unresponsive or erratic, a good first step is to check the screen for dirt, grease, or liquids, which can make the sensors go haywire; wipe it down with a dry microfiber cloth.

-   Some touch screens may appear to work improperly if they are registering an unintentional touch. Depending on the design of the device, it may be tempting to hold it in a way that leaves some part of your hand or arm too close to the edge of the screen; some devices will register this as a touch.

-   Your device may have touch-screen diagnostics available through hardware troubleshooting menus accessible through the BIOS. Refer to the manufacturer's resources for how to access these diagnostics. If available, they are a quick way to identify whether you're looking at a hardware or software/configuration issue. The Mouse applet in the Control Panel or Settings enables you to calibrate or reset your touch support. macOS has a Trackpad applet in System Preferences. Attempt to reset and recalibrate the display.

EXAM TIP   The troubleshooting issue known as a cursor drift can mean one of two things. First, the display shows a trail of ghost cursors behind your real cursor as you move it. This might point to an aging display or an improperly configured refresh rate. Second, the cursor moves erratically or drifts slowly in a steady direction (also known as touch calibration), whether you are touching the trackpad or not. If a reboot doesn't fix the pointer drift, the trackpad has probably been damaged in some way and needs to be replaced.

CHAPTER 24

Mobile Devices

In this chapter, you will learn how to

-   Explain the features and capabilities of mobile devices

-   Describe the major mobile operating systems

-   Describe how to configure mobile devices

It's hard to imagine that most of the mobile devices we use today (in particular the popular iPhone, iPad, and Android devices) at one time sounded like science fiction rather than reality. Mobile devices have revolutionized the way we work and play. Devices such as smartphones and tablets enable people to access unique tools and features from just about anywhere and accomplish essential tasks on the go.

As amazing as mobile devices are, it's not easy to find a definition of mobile device that everyone agrees on. If you ask folks who are comfortable with these devices, you'll get lots of descriptions of functions and capabilities as opposed to what they are. In essence, the following aspects make a device mobile (and even these will sometimes create debate):

-   Lightweight, usually less than two pounds

-   Small, designed to move with you (in your hand or pocket)

-   Touch or stylus interface; no keyboard or mice

-   Sealed unit lacking any user-replaceable parts

-   Non-desktop OS; mobile devices use special mobile operating systems

The last one is important---as discussed in Chapter 23, a device's OS is the easiest way to differentiate between something like a 2-in-1 laptop in a tablet form factor and a plain tablet mobile device. Your typical portable computer runs a desktop OS such as Windows, macOS, or some Linux distribution such as Ubuntu. A true mobile device will typically run Apple iOS, iPadOS, or some form of Google's Android.

EXAM TIP   CompTIA A+ 1102 objective 1.8 lists iPadOS, iOS, and Android under cell phone/tablet OSs. The same objective lists Windows, Linux, macOS, and Chrome OS under workstation OSs. Be aware that while there are some tablets that run versions of Windows, for exam purposes, Windows is treated as a desktop operating system rather than a mobile one.

This chapter explores mobile devices in detail. We'll first look at the hardware features and capabilities of devices common in the mobile market. Next, we'll examine mobile operating system software. The chapter finishes with the details of configuring the devices for personal use. We'll save mobile device troubleshooting and security for Chapter 25. The CompTIA A+ certification exams are serious about mobile devices and we have a lot of ground to cover, so let's get started.

1101

Mobile Computing Devices

The specialized hardware of mobile devices defines to a large degree the capabilities of those devices. This first section examines smartphones and tablets and then looks at specific hardware common to many of these devices.

Device Variants

Most modern mobile devices fall into one of a few categories, including smartphones, tablets, and wearable technology, which all have similar features and capabilities. There are a few other mobile device types, and they are best understood as devices purpose-built to be better at some task than a general-purpose device such as a smartphone or tablet; an e-reader is a good example. The CompTIA A+ 1101 exam objectives focus on smartphones and tablets, but be aware that these other types of mobile devices exist.

Smartphones

One of the earliest types of mobile device was the personal digital assistant (PDA), such as the Compaq iPaq from the late 1990s. PDAs had the basic features of today's mobile devices but lacked cellular connectivity, so you couldn't make a phone call. Many people, your author included, spent close to ten years carrying a mobile phone and a PDA, wondering when somebody would combine these two things. Starting around 2003--2005, companies began marketing PDAs that included cellular telephones (although cool features like using the PDA to access Internet data weren't well developed). Figure 24-1 shows an early PDA-with-a-phone, the once very popular RIM BlackBerry.

Figure 24-1  RIM BlackBerry (courtesy of the TotalSem Tech Museum)

While these tools were powerful for their time, it wasn't until Apple introduced the iPhone (see Figure 24-2) in 2007 that we saw the elements that define a modern smartphone:

Figure 24-2  Early Apple iPhone

-   A multi-touch interface as the primary input method for using the smartphone

-   A well-standardized application programming interface (API) enabling developers to create new apps for the system

-   Tight consolidation of cellular data to the device, enabling any application (Web browsers, e-mail clients, games, and so on) to exchange data over the Internet

-   Synchronization and distribution tools that enable users to install new apps and synchronize or back up data

Since then, smartphones have developed many more features and uses. They have come to play a big role in the trend toward ever-present connectivity and seamless data access across all of our devices. Because smartphones do so much more than simply make and receive phone calls---we surf the Web with them, stream music and video, send and receive e-mail, and even do work with them---the infrastructure and technologies that connect smartphones with a mesh of networked data and services must be fast, robust, and secure.

Most smartphones run one of the big two operating systems: Google Android or Apple iOS (see Figure 24-3). iOS runs exclusively on Apple hardware, such as the iPhone. Phones running Android come from a multitude of manufacturers. Smartphones typically have no user-replaceable or field-replaceable components, and have to be brought into specialized (and in some cases, authorized) service centers for repair.

Figure 24-3  Examples of the big two smartphone OSs: Android (left), iOS (right)

Tablets

Tablets are very similar to smartphones; they run the same (or at least similar in the case of Apple's tablets) OSs and apps, and use the same multi-touch screens. From a tech's perspective, they are like large smartphones (without the phone). While a typical smartphone screen is around 5 to 6 inches, tablets run around 7 to 12.9 inches (see Figure 24-4).

Figure 24-4  Typical tablet

Unlike smartphones, tablets generally lack a cellular data connection (unless you buy a model specifically designed for it), instead counting on 802.11 Wi-Fi to provide Internet connectivity. Tablets are available at many price points, from more budget-friendly options that sacrifice performance and build quality in favor of affordability, all the way to high-end devices that use cutting-edge hardware, premium materials, and the most advanced available features. Tablets have come a long way since they debuted, and are now fairly ubiquitous not only for individual users but also in business settings.

Mobile Hardware Features

Much of the usefulness of mobile devices is driven by the many hardware features they include. This section explores the basics: screen technologies, cameras, microphones, digitizers, and GPS connectivity.

Screen Technologies

Mobile devices use a variety of screen types. Most tablets use some type of LCD panel, just like portable devices and desktop monitors. The less expensive ones use twisted nematic (TN); the better ones, like the Apple iPad, use an in-plane switching (IPS) panel for richer colors and better viewing angles. Refer back to Chapter 17 if you need to review the difference between these panel types. We'll take a look at the technology that turns these screens into touch interfaces in the upcoming "Digitizers" section.

Some smaller devices, like the better smartphones, use a related technology---organic light-emitting diode (OLED)---that lights the screen with an organic compound. Applying an electric current causes the organic layer to glow in the precise spots desired. Displaying a checkerboard pattern of black and white, in other words, only lights up the white squares. OLEDs and AMOLEDs don't use backlights at all, which means they can display true black, they're lighter, and they use less electricity than LCDs.

EXAM TIP   OLED screens use an organic compound exposed to electrical current for lighting; they don't have a traditional backlight.

NOTE   Some devices use active matrix OLED (AMOLED), which adds a TFT layer for more control over the screen. AMOLED is more expensive than OLED, but provides a better picture that uses less electricity.

Cameras

Many mobile devices have distinct front-facing and rear-facing cameras. These cameras enable chatting with Grandma over Facetime, tearful YouTube confessionals, and Instagram selfies! Devices with a camera can transmit video over cellular and IP-based networks (such as the Internet) just like dedicated or built-in webcams on full-fat desktops and laptops.

Smartphone cameras have come a long way since the grainy, low-resolution images of yesteryear. Many of them now rival all but the high-end dedicated point-and-shoot cameras used by advanced hobbyists and professional photographers (see Figure 24-5).

Figure 24-5  Author's camera app on his iPhone

Modern smartphone camera features include high dynamic range (HDR), light compensation, and other functions that enable the user to finely tune a photo or video. Manufacturers have even incorporated advances in artificial intelligence to their image-processing software to enhance the end results. Higher-end and even midrange devices often have more than one camera lens built in, allowing for more versatile photography. Additionally, these cameras offer a variety of options when taking photos and video; some cameras enable you to take "bursts" of shots (like ten in a single second) to make sure you capture faster-moving objects and action shots, as well as slow-motion video. When coupled with the multitude of apps available for mobile devices, you can edit photos and videos on-the-fly, adding light-filter effects, cleaning up shots, and even adding special effects.

Microphones

Almost all mobile devices incorporate at least one microphone. Smartphones certainly wouldn't be of much value without a microphone, and you wouldn't be very effective at communicating over Skype or FaceTime without them. Additionally, many people use mobile devices to dictate speech or record other sounds, so microphones serve many purposes on mobile devices.

As with the portable devices discussed in the previous chapter, mobile devices commonly have more than one microphone to enable noise-cancelling routines to work their magic. In contrast to those more traditional portables, you may need to take more care to avoid blocking any of the microphones on a mobile device.

Digitizers

When electrical engineers talk about a digitizer, they refer to a component that transforms analog signals into digital ones; that is to say, it digitizes them. That's not what we techs talk about when discussing digitizers on mobile devices. A digitizer refers to the component that provides the "touch" part of a touch screen. When your finger contacts a touch screen, the digitizer's fine grid of sensors under the glass detects your finger and signals the OS its location on the grid. As with modern trackpads, you can use one or more fingers to interact with most touch screens.

EXAM TIP   The CompTIA A+ 1101 exam objectives mention touch-screen configuration as something you do on a laptop or mobile device. While this used to only really apply to touch-screen laptops, some configuration options for touch screens have made their way to tablets and smartphones as well.

Location Services

One major feature of mobile devices is the ability to track the device's location through global positioning system (GPS) services, cellular, or Wi-Fi connections. Users rely on cellular location services to conveniently find things near them, such as stores and restaurants, or to determine when their Uber driver will show up. This section discusses some of what a mobile device such as a smartphone can do with GPS capability, followed by a look at privacy concerns associated with location tracking.

A great example of how smartphones can use GPS is the traffic and navigation app Waze (see Figure 24-6). Waze not only navigates, but its crowd-sourced data collection provides you with amazing real-time knowledge of the road ahead.

Figure 24-6  Waze in action

Another cool use of GPS is finding your phone when it's missing. The iPhone offers the Find My iPhone app (see Figure 24-7), for example. This feature is part of the iCloud service that comes free with any iOS device.

Figure 24-7  Find My iPhone app

Location Tracking and Privacy  Tracking your location is generally a good thing...when you want to be tracked. By default, mobile OSs track and in many cases record your location for an extended amount of time. This is called geotracking, and not everyone likes it. If you don't like this feature, turn it off. Figure 24-8 shows turning off Location on an Android phone.

Figure 24-8  Turning off Location

EXAM TIP   Because mobile devices tap into the Internet or cellular phone networks, the devices have identifying numbers such as a MAC address. The cell phone companies and government agencies can use the ID or MAC address to pinpoint where you are at any given time. Geotracking has a lot of room for abuse of power.

1102

Mobile Operating Systems

Most mobile devices run either Apple iOS or Google Android. This section discusses their development and implementation models, as well as some of their major features, including how their app stores work.

Development Models

Before we look at each mobile operating system in detail, let's step back to consider the big picture. The different underlying philosophies inspiring these operating systems---and guiding the companies that make them---help us understand why they do something one way instead of another. We'll start with a look at closed source and open source as development models. You may have heard these terms regarding how software is released and licensed (if not, Chapter 28 will discuss how these terms apply to licensing), but they also provide an interesting framework for looking at how products are developed and released. Then we'll discuss how these models apply to operating systems.

Closed Source

When it comes to development models, it may help to think of closed source as another way to refer to the traditional practice of making and selling a product without telling anyone how you made it. The traditional model makes intuitive sense, at least in our culture; how your product is made is a trade secret---something that gives you a competitive edge---and sharing it could inspire competitors to use your design, or potential customers to make it themselves.

Vendor-Specific and Proprietary  We sometimes apply the terms vendor-specific or proprietary to a closed-source product or technology, most often when we're trying to highlight something that doesn't use common, open standards. The terms are related to closed source, but don't confuse them; they aren't interchangeable. These labels often imply that the product may not play nice (or be interoperable) with other products, may have connectors and cables that are hard to find or expensive, may not be friendly to users who want to tinker with or modify it, may be harder to repair, and may pose a host of other problems.

The concept behind and use of these terms is sometimes slippery. As you'll see later in the chapter, a device maker may use a common standard such as USB 3.0, but design its own connector. Even though the device maker is technically using part of the open USB 3.0 standard, we'll still call the device's ports and cables proprietary.

Open Source

In this broader sense, you can think of a product as open source if its maker releases the instructions for making it---it doesn't have to be software (though that's usually the context). When a company commits to open sourcing one or more products, it has to operate differently than companies using a closed-source model. Secrecy, for example, is necessarily a smaller part of its business; knowing that anyone could make its products, the company has to focus on other factors (such as price, service, support, convenience, quality, innovation, etc.) to stay competitive.

Just because a company releases these instructions to the public doesn't mean anyone else gets to own them. Much as artists and authors set terms that specify whether the rest of us can legally copy or modify their work, the owners or authors of the instructions for making a product will specify terms for how others are allowed to use them. Sometimes the owners or authors may just say they're releasing the instructions for personal use or educational purposes---you can study what they've done and make your own product, but you can't start selling copies. When it comes to open-source software, these terms commonly dictate whether companies who modify the software are obliged to publish their changes, and whether they're allowed to profit from how they use it.

Development Models and the Mobile OS

The development model is one of many choices that reflect underlying company philosophy and goals. A company that makes an open-source mobile operating system like Google Android has little control over how the OS will be used and who can modify it. A company that makes a closed-source operating system like Microsoft Windows but licenses the OS to device makers has more control---the company knows the OS won't be modified and can be picky about which devices to license it for. A company making a closed-source OS like Apple iOS for its own devices can tailor-fit the software to the hardware it will run on. A company that builds an OS others can use and modify as they see fit and a company that builds an OS handcrafted exclusively for its own hardware obviously have very different underlying philosophies and goals.

The big thing to keep in mind with an open-source operating system like Android is that companies building devices that use the OS don't have to share the OS developer's underlying philosophy---they can have wildly varying goals and development models of their own. If the operating system's license allows it, each of the device makers could modify the OS before installing it on their own device---and never release those modifications. The modifications might just enable special hardware to work, but they could also install apps you don't want and can't remove, cause third-party apps coded without knowledge of the modifications to malfunction, or collect information about how you use the device.

To bring this all together, the point is that a manufacturer can put an open-source operating system on an otherwise closed-source device---don't assume a device is itself open source just because the mobile OS it uses is. In fact, vanishingly few of the devices with an open-source OS are best seen as open-source products.

Think back to the earlier discussion of an open-source development process and apply it to a smartphone. The most extreme interpretation of an open-source smartphone is that the maker has released all of the instructions and code someone else would need to manufacture an identical smartphone and all of the components inside it. A more likely (but still exceptional) scenario is that all of the software on the device when it leaves the factory is open sourced, including the operating system, drivers, and the firmware powering its components.

Apple iOS and iPadOS

Apple's closed-source mobile operating system, iOS (see Figure 24-9), runs on the iPhone. (The Apple iWatch runs a different OS, called watchOS. It is also closed source.) The Apple model of development is very involved: Apple tightly controls the development of the hardware, OS, developer tools, and app deployment platform. Apple's disciplined development model is visible in its strict development policies and controls for third-party developers, and this control contributes to the high level of security in iOS.

Figure 24-9  iOS 15

iOS apps are almost exclusively purchased, installed, and updated through Apple's App Store. An exception is providers of line-of-business apps specific to a particular organization. These internal development groups reside within an organization and can develop iOS apps, but deploy them only to devices that are under the organization's control, skipping the public App Store. They still have to undergo a type of Apple partnering and enterprise licensing approval process.

Apple's famous iPad tablet used to run iOS, but over time, the needs of tablet users evolved, and it now runs iPadOS (see Figure 24-10) The differences between iOS and iPadOS are slight, and the experience of using an iPad is very similar to that of using an iPhone. The average user may not notice the differences, but there are some important distinctions between the two that a good tech should aware of.

Figure 24-10  iPadOS in action

One key difference is in touch pen compatibility. Touch pens are, in general, an advanced version of the traditional stylus, which usually is just a plastic pointer with some kind of rubber point. Apple's touch pen is called the Apple Pencil and only works with iPadOS-equipped devices. Beyond keeping the screen clear of fingerprints, a touch pen can be used to effectively handwrite notes and draw precise and often professional-caliber artwork. Tablet users have gravitated toward using tablets as laptop substitutes in some cases, so iPadOS accommodates this by incorporating some of the features more commonly associated with macOS, such as multitasking functionality, mouse and keyboard support, and the ability to connect external storage via USB-C. On the flipside, there are things that iOS does that iPadOS doesn't. Most notably, iOS allows direct pairing with Apple's smartwatch, while iPadOS does not.

Google Android

For simplicity, think of Android and iOS as opposites. Android (see Figure 24-11) is an open-source platform, based on yet another open platform, Linux, and is owned by Google. Because Android is open source, device manufacturers can (and do!) alter or customize it as they see fit; there are differences among the implementations from various vendors. Google writes the core Android code and occasionally releases new versions (naming each major update after a dessert or candy of some sort), at which point vendors customize it to add unique hardware features or provide a branded look and feel.

Figure 24-11  Android 12 (Snow Cone)

Android apps are available to purchase and download through various app stores, such as Google Play and the Amazon Appstore. Android app stores tend to be fairly open in contrast to the high standards and tight control Apple applies to its third-party app developers, and Android makes it easier to install arbitrary applications downloaded from a Web site.

NOTE   Android-based devices may be more open than iOS ones on average, but it isn't a given. How open or closed an individual Android device is will depend greatly on how its manufacturer has modified the OS.

Mobile OS Features

Mobile operating systems come in a variety of flavors and sometimes have different features as well as different interfaces. But they also have a great deal in common, because consumers expect them to perform most of the tasks they are used to seeing in other mobile devices, regardless of operating system. Whether you are using an iPhone, an Android phone, or a smart watch, you still expect to be able to send texts, check your e-mail, and make video calls. Because of this, mobile OS differences boil down to hardware and app support, look and feel, and philosophical differences that manifest in how the OS goes about a common task. We'll take a quick look at some of the features common to all mobile operating systems and point out differences along the way.

User Interfaces

All mobile OSs have a graphical user interface (GUI), meaning you interact with them by accessing icons on the screen. Current models do not offer a command-line interface. Each OS usually has either a major button or a row of icons that enables the user to navigate to the most prominent features of the device. They also all support touch gestures, such as swiping to navigate between screens or pinching to zoom in or out. Most mobile OSs have some type of menu system that enables the user to find different apps and data.

iOS offers some customization of the user interface. You can group apps together into folders, for example, and reposition most apps for your convenience. The iOS look and feel, however, will remain consistent.

Android offers a very different GUI experience by employing programs called launchers that enable users to customize their Android device extensively. Many companies make launchers, and different manufacturers ship devices preloaded with launchers they make or prefer. Samsung devices use the TouchWiz launcher, for example. I use the Nova launcher on my Android phone. The launcher enables you to change nearly every aspect of the GUI, including icon size, animations, gestures, and more.

Most mobile devices include an accelerometer and a gyroscope, one to measure movement in space and the other to maintain proper orientation of up and down. These extend the user interface to include how you move the device itself; a common use is changing the screen orientation when you rotate a device from vertical to horizontal, for example, to enhance watching videos on YouTube.

Wi-Fi Calling

While every mobile device that calls itself a phone must have support for cellular wireless, another feature that many mobile devices include is Wi-Fi calling, the capability to make regular phone calls over Wi-Fi networks. Wi-Fi calling is very useful if you often find yourself in a place with poor cellular coverage but good Wi-Fi. To use Wi-Fi calling, first both your phone and carrier need to support it, then you need to enable it in your phone settings (see Figure 24-12). Once Wi-Fi calling is enabled, the phone will use any Wi-Fi network it's connected to (assuming the performance is acceptable) for all phone calls.

Figure 24-12  Option to enable Wi-Fi calling on an iPhone 13 Pro

Virtual Assistants

"Hey, Siri!"

"Yes, Mike?"

"What's the weather like today?"

"Always sunny where you are, Mike."

Okay, maybe they're not quite that cool, but the virtual assistants on smartphones and tablets enable quick, vocal interaction to accomplish common goals. For example, one only has to ask Siri (Apple's virtual assistant) how to find the nearest restaurant or tourist attraction, and she (Siri's voice is female by default) will respond with the information sought. Virtual assistants can also be useful in performing Internet searches and, in some cases, even activating and using certain apps on the mobile device. This helps people who may have certain disabilities that may prevent them from tapping or typing on the device, by enabling them to use voice commands.

A virtual assistant is also useful if you must use your smartphone while driving (although anything that diverts your attention from the road is discouraged for safety reasons). You can speak to the smartphone's virtual assistant to place a call or get directions while driving, especially if the smartphone is paired with the car's Bluetooth system. The Windows 10/11 equivalent to Siri is called Cortana, and essentially serves the same functions and provides the same services and features. Google's virtual assistant, Google Assistant, is also available for iOS and any of Google's many platforms like Google Home and Android TV. In addition to the big three's virtual assistants, there are also apps you can download that provide other virtual assistant services, depending upon your platform.

Software Development Kits

Most mobile operating systems come with some sort of software development kit (SDK) or application development kit that you can use to create custom apps or add features to existing apps on the device. Figure 24-13 shows the development (programming) environment for the iOS SDK, Xcode, with the code for an iOS app open in the background window, and the same app code running in an iPhone simulator on top.

Figure 24-13  Xcode running an app written with the iOS SDK

Each mobile OS poses its own challenge to app developers. Apple's rigid development model makes it such that your app must pass a rigorous testing program before it is allowed into the App Store. Microsoft's development model, while not typically as rigid, is similar in nature. Google, on the other hand, allows anyone to create Android apps and distribute them to the masses without much interference.

Emergency Capabilities

One feature almost all currently marketed smartphones have built in is the emergency notification feature that enables them to receive broadcasts from national emergency broadcast systems, such as the Emergency Alert System (EAS) in the United States. This can be a very useful feature during severe weather, enabling you to receive warning text messages. In the event someone reports a child missing in your immediate area, it enables you to get AMBER Alerts. Many of these emergency broadcast system alerts also force your phone to emit a very loud sound or vibrate incessantly in order to get your attention.

While modern smartphones can place 911 calls effectively, the old 911 system relied on the Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN) to trace a call and determine its location, in order to dispatch emergency responders to the correct address quickly. This was problematic with mobile devices, so legislation was passed (the Wireless Communications and Public Safety Act of 1999) requiring carriers to be able to pinpoint the location of a mobile device, such as a smartphone. The Enhanced 911 (E911) system uses GPS and cellular networks to triangulate the location of a phone by its distance from cell towers, its transmission delay time, and other factors.

Mobile Payment Service

As smartphones and other mobile devices have become so much more commonplace in our daily lives, we've become very reliant on them to store our personal and sensitive information such as passwords, credit card numbers, financial documents, receipts, and more. Over time, smartphone manufacturers, as well as merchants, realized that the next logical step was to enable you to pay for goods and services simply by scanning your smartphone or using an app.

The app connects to your bank information and automatically transfers the funds from your bank to the merchant. This feature is called mobile payment service. Near field communication (NFC) applications refine the process further: simply place your device on or near the special pad at the register in order to authorize payment to the merchant. (See "NFC," later in this chapter, for the scoop on these tiny networks.)

Additionally, smartphone manufacturers produce their own payment systems. The Apple payment system, called Apple Pay, was first implemented with the iPhone 6, and support has been integrated into the Apple Watch. Apple Pay supports major credit card payment terminals and point-of-sale systems, including those fielded by Visa, MasterCard, and American Express. Apple Pay can use contactless payment terminals with NFC and supports in-app payments for online purchases.

Mobile payment systems have become a lot more popular over time. Since Apple saw success with Apple Pay, other software companies and mobile manufacturers followed suit. Samsung, one of the most prominent manufacturers of Android smartphones, released Samsung Pay in 2015. Google released their version in 2018, and predictably named it Google Pay. These apps have expanded their functionality to serve as full-blown digital wallets, allowing you to do more than just pay for things. One of the coolest features is that users can now store and transfer digital tickets for concerts and sporting events, making forgotten or lost tickets largely a thing of the past.

Airplane Mode

Airplane mode is simply a switch (either an actual hardware switch located on the mobile device or a software switch that can be located in the device's configuration settings) that turns off all cellular and wireless services, except Bluetooth (see Figure 24-14). The aptly named mode disables these communications so passengers can comply with restrictions protecting aircraft instruments from interference, though you can also use it as a shortcut for turning off communication functions.

Figure 24-14  Airplane mode enabled on iOS 15

VPN

As you'll recall from earlier chapters, VPNs establish secure connections between a remote client and the corporate infrastructure, or between two different sites, such as a branch office and the corporate office. VPNs are typically implemented using tunneling methods through an unsecure network, such as the Internet. In a client VPN setup, the host has client VPN software specially configured to match the corporate VPN server or concentrator configuration. This configuration includes encryption method and strength, as well as authentication methods.

A site-to-site VPN scenario uses VPN devices on both ends of the connection, configured to communicate only with each other, while the hosts on both ends use their respective VPN concentrators as a gateway. This arrangement is usually transparent to the users at both sites; hosts at the other site appear as if they are directly connected to the user's network.

VPNs can use a variety of technologies and protocols. The most popular ways to create a VPN are to use either a combination of the Layer 2 Tunneling Protocol (L2TP) and IPsec (see Figure 24-15), or Secure Sockets Layer (SSL)/Transport Layer Security (TLS). When using the L2TP/IPsec method, UDP port 1701 is used and must be opened on packet-filtering devices. In this form of VPN, users connect to the corporate network and can use all of their typical applications, such as their e-mail client, and can map shares and drives as they would if they were actually connected onsite to the corporate infrastructure.

Figure 24-15  Configuring a VPN

An SSL/TLS-based VPN, on the other hand, uses the standard SSL/TLS port, TCP 443, and is typically used through a client's Web browser. SSL/TLS-based VPNs don't normally require any special software or configuration on the client itself, but they don't give the client the same direct access to resources on the corporate network. Therefore, users may have to access these network resources through the client browser via an access portal.

NOTE   SSL has been entirely replaced by TLS, but you'll often still see things referred to as SSL/TLS or SSL. VPNs are one example where this is the case.

Configuring a Mobile Device

Mobile devices require some setup and configuration to function seamlessly in your life, though the industry is constantly refining and simplifying this process. Mobile devices typically come preconfigured with everything but your user account and network credentials. Just because you don't have to do much to get up and running anymore doesn't mean you're out of the woods, though. You may well need to configure corporate e-mail accounts, device add-ons, apps, synchronization settings, and other advanced features.

You can add capabilities by enhancing hardware and installing productivity apps. You also need to set up network connectivity, add Bluetooth devices, configure e-mail account(s), and enable the devices to synchronize with a computer. Plus you have a lot of add-on options; let's take a look.

Enhancing Hardware

A mobile device is a computer, just like your desktop or laptop, with the same basic components doing the same basic things. The construction centers on a primary circuit board, the motherboard, onto which every other component is attached. The biggest of these components is often the system on a chip (SoC), a wonder of miniaturization combining a CPU, GPU, and sundry other support logic onto a single silicon die, saving a lot of space and power in the process. An interesting aside about the CPUs used in these devices is that they are rarely Intel x86 based; instead, you are much more likely to run across an ARM architecture chip when perusing the spec sheets of your new tablet or smartphone. The iPad uses Apple-designed ARM A-series or M-series chips, for example, while Samsung's smartphones and tablets generally use ARM chips from Qualcomm's Snapdragon line-up.

Mobile devices use storage, though you'll never see one using a traditional magnetic hard disk drive (HDD) with spinning platters. Mobile devices use flash media such as a solid-state drive (SSD) or microSD card because they are smaller, use less power, and are much, much faster than spinning HDDs. Plus they're cooler, just like you.

Mobile devices differ from their larger brethren in two very significant areas of importance to techs. First, none of them offer any user-replaceable parts. If something breaks, you send the device back to the manufacturer, visit a local manufacturer-supported retail outlet such as the Apple Store, or take it to a specialized repair shop. Second, you can't upgrade mobile devices at all. Even a laptop enables you to upgrade RAM or a mass storage drive, for example, but the mobile device you buy is exactly what you get. You want something better? Buy a new one.

That said, every mobile device enables you to attach some kind of peripheral or external storage device. But every device offers different expansion capabilities, so it's hard to generalize about them. The closest you can get is the audio jack, but many smartphones no longer include them, in favor of Bluetooth connectivity. That being said, audio jacks are still around on some devices (see Figure 24-16).

Figure 24-16  Earbuds plugged into a smartphone

Note this is quickly changing as Apple dropped the jack as of the iPhone 7, and many Android devices have started leaving the port off as well, as Bluetooth wireless earbuds and speakers continue to become more popular, reliable, and affordable. Current iPhones and most iPads use the Lightning jack or USB-C, respectively, for physical external connections.

Apple Expansion Options

Apple devices offer the least expansion capability of all mobile devices, so even though they dominate the U.S. marketplace, there's not much to say about them. Most of the expansion on Apple devices is limited to proprietary cables and devices. The iPhone and iPad have historically used a single proprietary Lightning port for charging the device and connecting to the few external devices available. Figure 24-17 shows the typical use for the port: connecting to a USB AC adapter to charge.

Figure 24-17  USB charger connected to proprietary Lightning port

While the vast majority of Apple's iOS devices stick with the proprietary Lightning connector, Apple has switched to USB Type-C with most iPad variants. Who knows what this means for the iPhone line, but it is nice to see Apple expanding its use of the industry standard. We'll return to USB Type-C, along with a number of other connectors, later in the chapter.

iPhones and iPads enable you to mirror the screen to a multimedia device such as a projector or a smart TV. This enables seamless presentations, for example, through the excellent Apple Keynote program (see Figure 24-18). The multimedia connection originally required another adapter (see Figure 24-19), but if you're using your device with a smart TV or another Apple device like an iMac, you can achieve this wirelessly with a feature called AirPlay.

Figure 24-18  Apple Keynote on an iPad and a projector

Figure 24-19  Apple Digital AV Adapter

Android Expansion Options

Devices that use Google Android come with a variety of connections and expansion capabilities. Some offer microSD slots for adding storage in the form of these tiny flash memory cards (see Figure 24-20), but this is becoming less common.

Figure 24-20  microSD card and slot

Android devices used to have a more diverse range of connectors available, both for charging and connecting peripherals. Older devices sometimes used miniUSB, or proprietary power connectors, and some Android smartphones even had a tiny Micro-HDMI port. This has largely gone the way of the dinosaurs though, and most Android devices you'll see today make use of USB-C or occasionally still use microUSB.

Finally, some tablets (but rarely smartphones) sport a connector for attaching the device to an external monitor, such as a big screen or projector. Figure 24-21 shows a Micro-HDMI port and connector.

Figure 24-21  Micro-HDMI port and connector

Bluetooth

The last way that mobile devices expand their physical capabilities is wirelessly, most often using the Bluetooth standard (if you need a refresher on Bluetooth, refer back to Chapter 20). Traditionally, extending a mobile device with Bluetooth has meant adding a headset, mouse (though not with Apple iOS products), keyboard, or speaker. Figure 24-22 shows a diminutive Apple keyboard for the iPad and the iPad resting in a stand to make typing a little easier than using the virtual keyboard. With Bluetooth-enabled wearable devices growing in popularity, it can be tricky to decide how self-sufficient one of these must be before it stops counting as a mobile enhancement and enters the realm of full-fledged mobile device.

Figure 24-22  Keyboard associated with iPad

NOTE   See the "Bluetooth" section toward the end of this chapter for the steps to set up a mobile device with a Bluetooth speaker.

Installing and Configuring Apps

Mobile devices come from the manufacturer with a certain number of vital apps installed for accessing e-mail, surfing the Web, taking notes, making entries in a calendar, and so on. Almost all mobile devices offer multimedia apps to enable you to listen to music, take pictures, watch YouTube videos, and view photos. You'll find instant messaging tools and, in the case of smartphones, telephone capabilities.

Beyond these essentials, you'll install most other apps through an app store. As you read about the app ecosystem for each mobile OS, consider how well the details of each ecosystem mesh with the development models discussed earlier in the chapter. Even though the rules of each app ecosystem usually reflect this development model, don't assume the apps on offer will follow suit---you'll find plenty of closed-source apps available on Android and open-source apps available for iOS.

iOS/iPadOS Apps

Apple iPhone and the iPad use the iOS and iPadOS operating systems, respectively. Apple exerts more control over the user experience than any other manufacturer by insisting all app developers follow strict guidelines.

Apple maintains strict control over what apps can be installed onto iOS/iPadOS devices, meaning that if you want to get an app for your iPhone or iPad, you can only get it from the Apple App Store (see Figure 24-23). Apple must approve any app before it goes into the App Store, and Apple reserves the right to refuse to distribute any app that fails to measure up.

Figure 24-23  App Store

To add an app, select the App Store icon from the home screen. You can explore featured apps in the Today tab or peruse by category. You can check out the popular games, or simply search for what you want (see Figure 24-24).

Figure 24-24  Searching for Monument Valley 2

The first time you try to purchase an app through the App Store, you'll be prompted to set up an account. You can use an account that you created previously through the Apple iTunes music and video store or create a new Apple ID account. You can create a new Apple ID account with a few quick steps (see Figure 24-25) and a valid credit card.

Figure 24-25  Creating an Apple ID for iCloud and App Store purchases

Another iCloud feature, the iCloud Keychain, builds on the Keychain feature in macOS to synchronize user information, passwords, payment information, and other credentials with all of your Apple devices. (See "Synchronization," a little later in the chapter.) Keychain can seamlessly store many non-Apple credentials as well, such as logins for Facebook, Amazon, and other providers, and use them to auto-complete repetitive forms in both device apps and on Web sites. The real benefit is that you can authorize Apple to save this sensitive information, instead of authorizing each individual app or site to keep a copy.

Android Apps

Google Android powers many smartphones and a solid portion of tablets. Unlike Apple iOS, Google gives core Android away, enabling manufacturers to differentiate their Android devices from those of other manufacturers. A Samsung tablet, in other words, uses a version of Android that differs somewhat from the Android an ASUS tablet uses. Likewise, OnePlus developed a custom interface called OxygenOS to change the look and feel of Android on its devices.

Because of these modifications, few Android users ever use "stock" or unmodified Android. Despite the shared core OS, Android users familiar with devices from one manufacturer may get tripped up by the different interface on Android devices from a different maker. These differences make it important to combine knowledge of the Android version a smartphone or tablet runs with knowledge about the manufacturer and its modifications to Android. The manufacturer will typically assign a version number to each release of its modifications.

Android devices can usually get apps from more than one source. The most common is Android's default app store, Google Play (which offers well over 2 million apps)---but some manufacturers (such as Amazon, for its line of Fire devices) modify Android to change this.

Many manufacturers offer a store with apps developed or customized to work with their devices. These vendor-specific stores enable you to get apps that should work well with your Android smartphone or tablet.

You can also go to a third-party app store or market for apps developed "for Android" that probably will work with your device, but there's no guarantee that they'll work on all Android devices. This Wild West approach to apps makes the Android smartphone or tablet experience vastly different from the experience on iOS.

Network Connectivity

Mobile devices connect to the outside world through the cellular networks or through various 802.11 Wi-Fi standards. You learned specifics about the standards in Chapter 20, so I won't rehash them here. This section looks at standard configuration issues from the perspective of a mobile device.

When you want to connect to a Wi-Fi network, you need to enable Wi-Fi on your device and then actively connect to a network. If the network is properly configured with WPA2, or WPA3 encryption, then you also need to have the logon information to access the network. The most common way to connect is through the Settings app (see Figure 24-26).

Figure 24-26  Selecting the Settings icon

The Settings app enables you to do the vast majority of configuration necessary to a mobile device. To join a network, for example, tap the Wi-Fi (or Networks) option to see available networks (see Figure 24-27). Simply select the network you want to join and type in the passphrase or passcode. Give the mobile device a moment to get IP and DNS information from the DHCP server, and you're on the network.

Figure 24-27  Browsing available networks

After you connect to a network successfully, all mobile devices store that network access information automatically, creating a profile for the network based on its SSID. This works just like with any other device that connects to a Wi-Fi network. If the SSID of a network changes after you've connected to that network, your mobile device will fail to connect to the rechristened network. You need to delete the profile and reconnect. Delete the profile through the Settings app by choosing the Wi-Fi network and selecting Forget this network.

EXAM TIP   You can use the Settings app to turn off Wi-Fi or to go into airplane mode to stop the device from sending any signals out.

Cellular Data Networks

Anyone with a smartphone these days can enjoy the convenience of using wireless cellular technology. Who doesn't love firing up an Android phone or an iPhone and cruising the Internet from anywhere? As cell-phone technology converges with Internet access technologies, competent techs need to understand what's happening behind the scenes. That means tackling an alphabet soup of standards. Regardless of the standard, the voice and data used on smartphones and some tablets (unless you have 802.11 wireless turned on) moves through a cellular wireless network with towers that cover the world. Back in Chapter 21, we discussed the technologies that make up cellular networking, so now we're going to talk about how it can be enabled and disabled on most mobile devices.

As discussed earlier in this chapter in the context of mobile operating systems, Android and iOS have a lot in common and that includes similar ways to enable and disable your cellular network. The way to accomplish it is fairly simple: swipe down from the top of the screen to check for a quick option, labeled with something like Data or Cellular. Alternatively, you can use the Settings app (introduced in the previous section). Once you've found it, look for the menu option that says Data or Cellular, and toggle it on or off.

Radio Firmware

Mobile devices use a wide variety of radio technologies to access the Internet, e-mail, and corporate infrastructures. Generally, mobile devices have two types of radios: 802.11 and Bluetooth. If the device can make calls, it also has some form of cellular radio.

PRL, PRI, and Baseband Updates  As mobile devices travel, they frequently have to pass through areas that don't have strong signals, or into areas that the carrier does not service. When a mobile device connects to different carriers' networks, we say it is roaming; roaming may result in additional service charges, depending upon the carriers involved.

Your phone's firmware will receive occasional automatic updates to its Preferred Roaming List (PRL) from the carrier; the PRL is a priority-ordered list of the other carrier networks and frequencies it should search for when it can't locate its home carrier's network. Updates to this list are sent via your phone's cellular connection (called baseband updates, or over-the-air updates) or, in some cases, through firmware updates during normal operating system and firmware upgrades via synchronization.

CDMA devices may also receive product release instruction (PRI) updates, which modify a host of complex device settings. Don't worry about specifics, here---these settings can pertain to the intricacies of many functions such as GPS, cellular connectivity, and messaging---but instead focus on the fact that carriers use these product release instructions to ready the device for deployment on their networks, enable the network to route calls or messages to the device, and more. As such, PRI updates may be needed if the network is evolving during the lifetime of a device, the device needs to be moved to a new network, or the device has a new owner.

EXAM TIP   PRL updates are handled automatically during firmware/OS updates. They are only for CDMA networks. No one but the nerdiest of nerds will ever see these updates.

IMEI, ICCID, and IMSI  There are three particular identifiers you will need to understand in order to effectively manage mobile devices. The International Mobile Equipment Identity (IMEI) number is a 15-digit number used to uniquely identify a mobile device. IMEI numbers are unique to devices using the Global System for Mobile Communications (GSM) family of technologies, including its present-day descendants: 4G LTE and 5G. You can typically find this number printed inside the battery compartment of the mobile device, but you may not need to take the device apart: some operating systems enable you to view it inside the device configuration settings (see Figure 24-28).

Figure 24-28  IMEI settings on an Android phone

The IMEI number can be used to identify a specific device and even to block that device from accessing the carrier's network. If the device is lost or stolen, the user can notify her carrier, and the carrier can make sure the device can't be used on the network.

NOTE   Always write down your IMEI number when you get a new phone, as it can prove you are the actual owner if the phone is stolen or lost.

The ICCID number, which stands for Integrated Circuit Card Identifier, uniquely identifies a subscriber identity module (SIM). The SIM contains information unique to the subscriber (the owner of the phone), and is used to authenticate the subscriber to the network. SIMs can be moved from phone to phone, usually with no problems.

The third number is the International Mobile Subscriber Identity (IMSI) number. It is also included on the SIM, but represents the actual user associated with the SIM. This number is not normally accessible from the phone, but is usually available from the carrier, to ensure that stolen phones are not misused. The IMSI number can also be used to unlock a phone.

You might want to record these numbers for each managed device in the enterprise, whether for inventory purposes or so that you have them handy when you work with your mobile device management (MDM) software (look for a more in-depth explanation about MDM software in Chapter 25). The MDM software typically collects these identifiers along with other device information (such as the telephone number or MAC address) during the provisioning process and stores them in the mobile device inventory for you. Figure 24-29 shows how IMEI and ICCID numbers are listed for a newer Android device in the device settings.

Figure 24-29  IMEI and ICCID numbers

Data

Many mobile devices can use the cellular data services discussed in Chapter 20 to access the Internet. This way you can use your smartphone, tablet, or other mobile devices to get e-mail or browse the Web pretty much anywhere.

By default, mobile devices that use cellular networks for Internet connectivity use data roaming, meaning they'll jump from cell tower to cell tower and from your provider to another provider without obvious notice. This is no big deal when you travel within your own country where competing providers have inexpensive roaming agreements.

Watch out for data roaming outside your country! If you travel to another country, your mobile device will happily and seamlessly connect via another cell provider if one is available. This can lead to some shockingly huge bills from your cell phone company when you get back from that cruise or international trip. If you're going outside your cell provider's coverage area, get a plan that specifies that you're traveling. It'll still be more expensive than your regular plan, but not nearly as crazy as an accidental roaming charge.

If you don't need to connect when out of country, turn data roaming off. You'll find the feature in the Settings app, as you might expect. You can also turn off cellular data entirely or only turn off cellular services selectively if your device can do more than one type. You would want to turn off cellular data, for example, if you don't have an unlimited data plan and are getting near your limits. There are also some security reasons to disable cellular connections while traveling, which we'll explore further in Chapter 25.

E-mail

Every mobile device uses an e-mail service set up specifically from the mobile OS developer. Plus, you can configure devices to send and receive standard e-mail as well. Let's look at the integrated options first.

All mobile devices offer e-mail services from the manufacturer or the OS developer. iOS and iPadOS devices integrate perfectly with iCloud, Apple's one-stop shop for e-mail, messaging, and online storage. Android devices assume a Gmail account, so they feature a Gmail option front and center.

Aside from the integrated e-mail options, mobile devices enable you to set up standard corporate and ISP e-mail configurations as well. The process is similar to that of setting up e-mail accounts that you learned about in Chapter 21. Apple devices go through the Settings app, tap Mail, then tap the Accounts option (see Figure 24-30). Tap the Add Account option to bring up the default e-mail options (see Figure 24-31). If you want to connect to a Microsoft Exchange Server--based e-mail account, tap the appropriate option here and type in your e-mail address, domain, username, password, and description.

Figure 24-30  Accounts screen on iPhone

Figure 24-31  Default e-mail types on iPhone

Neither POP3 nor IMAP4 is one of Apple's suggested options, so if you want to set up an account of either type, you'll need to tap the Other option on the initial Add Account screen. Eventually you'll get prompted to choose POP3 or IMAP and type in addresses for the sending (SMTP) and receiving servers.

Android-based devices assume you'll have a Gmail account as your primary account, so you'll find Gmail's distinctive app icon on the home screen (see Figure 24-32). Gmail also can talk to other, non-Gmail e-mail services for setting up Exchange, POP3, or IMAP4 accounts; you configure it the same way as you would a desktop e-mail application, including putting in the port number and security type, in this case, TLS, if the server lacks autoconfigure (see Figure 24-33).

Figure 24-32  Gmail app

Figure 24-33  Setting up a secure IMAP account

EXAM TIP   The latest versions of Android simply query the e-mail server to configure port numbers and security types automatically, just like modern desktop-based e-mail clients. Even though current devices automate this process, the CompTIA A+ 1101 objectives include port numbers, so you need to know them.

The CompTIA A+ 1101 exam will hit you pretty hard on e-mail settings, specifically on TCP port numbers for the various e-mail protocols. We've covered these in earlier chapters, but here's a quick cheat sheet and a few alternative numbers for real-world applications:

-   POP3 uses TCP port 110.

-   IMAP4 uses TCP port 143.

-   SMTP uses TCP port 25.

Many servers block these default ports; plus, when you move to more secure versions of the protocols, you need to use other port numbers. I have no clue whether CompTIA will quiz on the secure ports for POP3, IMAP4, and SMTP, but here they are:

-   Secure POP3 uses TCP port 995.

-   Secure IMAP4 uses TCP port 993.

-   Secure SMTP uses TCP port 465 or 587.

Finally, you may also have to configure other settings, such as Secure/Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions (S/MIME) standard, used to configure digital signature settings for e-mail, and contacts from the corporate address book, depending on how the corporate e-mail server is set up.

EXAM TIP   Be familiar with corporate e-mail configuration settings for Gmail, Yahoo, Outlook, and iCloud (You'll get a closer look at them in Chapter 25). Know the corporate and ISP e-mail configuration settings for POP3, IMAP4, port and security settings, and Exchange.

Synchronization

From the first day mobile devices came into existence there was a problem: synchronizing data. People don't want their contacts on their mobile devices to be different than the contacts on their desktop---or online contacts. People don't want to edit e-mail on their mobile device and then have to go online to make the same changes. People only want one calendar. If you have a mobile device, you're going to want a method for all these different sets of data to synchronize so you only have one set of contacts, one e-mail inbox, one calendar, and so forth.

To keep files and data up to date, smartphones and tablets can synchronize, or sync, with cloud-based servers over the Internet or with local machines. These files and data include personal documents, Internet bookmarks, calendar appointments, social media data, e-books, and even location data. Older devices, such as BlackBerry and Palm Pilot, had a specialized sync program you installed on your computer to sync contacts, calendars, and so on. Today's devices sync through the cloud or optionally use a dedicated program.

Various mobile devices sync differently, depending upon the device vendor and software required. iOS/iPadOS devices use Apple iCloud to sync iPhones, iPads, and Macs via the cloud. Android devices can use Google's many services to sync certain configuration settings, apps, photos, texts, and so on. In some cases individual apps will synchronize directly; for example, a podcast app might synchronize data such as subscribed shows. Older versions of iOS needed to sync to a laptop or desktop computer via Apple's iTunes application. While this is still fully supported, most users will just let iCloud handle everything in the background.

EXAM TIP   Synchronization enables mobile devices to keep up to date with a lot of essential information. You should know the types of data typically synced, including contacts, e-mail, photos, and calendar information for the exam, and other types of data to be a great tech. It's a lot. You can do this!

Synchronize to the Automobile

Automobile makers know you will talk on the phone while driving. While inherently dangerous---a good conversation can distract you from surroundings, including other 3000-pound death machines---everyone does it. Modern automobiles come equipped with voice communication systems, hands-free calling that uses your smartphone via Bluetooth (see Figure 24-34). Synchronizing to the automobile enables voice-activated contact calling, among other things, and often hooks up with a car's navigation system to help you get from point A to point B.

Figure 24-34  Calling via an iPhone using a car's built-in entertainment system

Exchange ActiveSync

Exchange ActiveSync (EAS) is a Microsoft protocol used to synchronize Microsoft Exchange e-mail, contacts, and calendars that has become widely used across a range of mobile OS platforms and hardware vendors, including Apple and Android devices. It was originally developed as a synchronization protocol for Microsoft Exchange corporate users, but has evolved over time to include more device control and management features. EAS not only has the capability to set up and configure network connectivity and secure e-mail options for clients that connect to Microsoft Exchange corporate servers, but also has the capability to control a much wider range of functions. Some of these functions include the ability to set password policies, remotely wipe or lock a mobile device, and control some device settings.

Synchronization Methods

In the old days, mobile devices were synchronized to a desktop (uphill, both ways, in the snow!), using a specific type of synchronization software provided with the device. Also, the type of data was typically limited to contact information, but we liked it because it was all we had. Now, there are newfangled ways you can sync device contacts, media files, and even apps. You can also get updates and patches from the device manufacturer by syncing your device.

With faster cellular and Wi-Fi networking technologies, you can skip the desktop and sync even large amounts of data to the cloud. Each phone vendor has its own cloud technology that can tie to your user account and store personal data from your mobile device. Apple has iCloud, Microsoft has OneDrive, and Google has Google Drive, as do some of the individual manufacturers that make Android devices.

There are also independent cloud providers that enable you to store your personal data, and even share it with others. Dropbox is a prime example of this type of provider, although there are many others. Most cloud storage services require you to set up security measures to protect your data, such as requiring a username and password for authentication. Some cloud providers also allow you to encrypt data stored in their cloud.

Synchronizing your data to a personal computer (or laptop) has both advantages and disadvantages. Some advantages of syncing to a personal computer are that you can be in full control of storing and protecting your own data, encrypted any way you choose, and can also move it to portable storage in case you need a backup of it later. A disadvantage is that you must be able to connect to your computer---a small problem if you can't bring it with you.

Syncing to the cloud also has its advantages and disadvantages. If you have a good cellular or wireless signal, you can sync from anywhere. You do have to be careful of syncing over insecure public wireless networks, however, since there is a possibility that your data could be intercepted and read over these insecure networks. Another disadvantage of syncing to the cloud is that once your data is in the cloud, you no longer fully control it. You are at the mercy of the security mechanisms and privacy policies of your provider. You have to accept whatever security mechanisms they use, such as encryption strength (or lack thereof), and you have to abide by their privacy policies, which may allow them to turn your data over to other companies for marketing, or even to law enforcement. Additionally, some cloud providers may limit the type and amount of data you are allowed to store in their cloud. These restrictions are typically in place to prevent software, movie, and music piracy.

These are all considerations you'll have to think carefully about when choosing whether to sync to the desktop, the cloud, or both.

EXAM TIP   The CompTIA A+ 1102 objectives cover synchronization extensively, and this overlaps with an 1102 objective, single sign-on (SSO). Be aware that a properly coded application on a modern mobile device can enable you to log in with one of the other accounts you're probably already logged into, such as Google, Apple ID, Facebook, Twitter, etc. The process for using your active authenticated session with one of these common services to sign you into other services is called single sign-on (SSO). This may come up on the 1101 exam in the context of mobile device synchronization or on the 1102 exam in the context of single sign-on.

Synchronization Issues

The most common synchronization issue is a connectivity, device, or remote infrastructure problem that leaves data partially synced. A partial sync could result in incompletely downloaded e-mail or even duplicate messages as the device tries over and over to successfully sync, repeatedly downloading the same e-mail messages. A device may attempt to sync to download an OS patch or update and may fail. The most likely culprit is connectivity issues with Wi-Fi or cellular connections, and the problem can usually be resolved by moving the device to an area with a stronger signal. This doesn't prevent upstream connectivity issues, which may also have to be examined.

There are other problems that prevent synchronization, including authentication issues, OS version issues, or incorrect configuration settings. If a device won't sync even after getting it to a stronger, more stable connection, these are some of the things you should examine. Another problem may be the remote end of the connection. This may be the enterprise e-mail server, or even the entry point into the enterprise network. Failure to properly authenticate or meet the requirements of the entry device may prevent a device from synchronizing.

Another issue you may want to examine when you have synchronization trouble is that multiple sources may be trying to sync the same data. A device can synchronize from an enterprise app store, for example, as well as the vendor app store; personal e-mail services, such as Gmail and Yahoo Mail; and even from third-party providers of "whatever-as-a-service" and cloud storage. This could be as simple as a configuration change you had to make for one service preventing another from working---or the sources might be independently trying to sync different data to the same location. In the enterprise environment, it's the mobile device management team's job to put together a management and technical strategy that will ensure minimal conflict between different synchronization sources.

Account Setup and Management

If you or someone you know uses mobile devices for work, you've most likely done or at least seen some form of account setup or management. Most productivity apps, like Microsoft 365, Google Workspace, and Apple's suite of apps that use iCloud, are designed to be synchronized across multiple devices. This means that the document you were reviewing or the e-mail you were carefully writing on your laptop before you had to leave for an appointment can be paused, synchronized, and resumed on another computer or, you guessed it, a mobile device. This sort of cross-platform synchronization has become essential to businesses and it's going to be something you'll encounter on the CompTIA A+ exam, as well as on the job in IT.

The big question you probably have now is about how to synchronize these accounts. In this regard, mobile devices work mostly in the same way as a desktop or a laptop. The mobile versions of productivity apps generally mimic most of the functionality of their desktop counterparts, with optimized user interfaces to account for things like the smaller display, touchscreen, screen rotation, and other mobile device characteristics. They're also optimized to make it as easy as possible to synchronize. In many cases, it's as simple as installing the mobile version of an app like Microsoft 365, entering the e-mail and password associated with the account, and waiting a few seconds until your Teams chat or Outlook e-mails are available to you on the go.

Most of these apps give users or administrators the ability to make adjustments, including to synchronization settings. Some device synchronization settings may, for example, cause your device to save things you're working on in local storage. If this happens, you may be happy about it, or you may wonder why your smartphone suddenly started displaying a notification that your storage is full. You may also notice that your accounts aren't synchronizing. In this case, one of the first places you should look is your account settings; the fix may be as simple as turning on synchronization in your mobile app.

Mobile Device Communication and Ports

Mobile devices wouldn't be nearly as useful if they didn't have ways to interconnect with the outside world. This section looks at the many technologies and connections mobile devices use to get data flowing to the Internet and other devices.

MicroUSB/MiniUSB

If you have an Android device made before 2017, it's very likely it has either a micro- or mini-USB port to charge, connect to laptops or desktops, and sync between those devices. MicroUSB or miniUSB connectors were standard on most Android devices. That's not to say that you won't be able to find devices using proprietary connectors; Google makes the OS available to multiple device manufacturers, and some manufacturers do maintain a proprietary connector.

Lightning Connector

With the iPhone 5, Apple introduced its most recent proprietary connector, known as the Lightning connector. It replaced the older 30-pin dock connector that Apple used on previous iPhones and iPads. The Lightning connector is an 8-pin connector (see Figure 24-35) that can be inserted without regard to proper orientation; in other words, it's not "keyed" to insert a specific way (such as right-side up or upside down, as traditional USB connectors are) into the device.

Figure 24-35  Lightning connector

NOTE   Earlier-model iPads made use of the Lightning connector, but in 2018, Apple released the first USB-C iPad Pro. Since then, Apple has gradually transitioned its various other iPad models, like the Air and Mini, to USB-C. You'll only find Lightning connectors in use on older models, or the basic iPad still sold by Apple at the time of writing.

The proprietary nature of the Lightning cable means it's more expensive than a normal USB cable. It is licensed to other manufacturers through the Made for iPhone (MFi) program, but to prevent widespread production of fake Lightning connectors by unlicensed manufacturers, it contains a small chip that identifies it as a true Lightning connector, and cables without that chip typically won't work or will only have limited use.

NOTE   The Apple Lightning standard is the epitome of proprietary vendor-specific ports and connectors. Only iOS devices use Lightning for communication and power. Android devices typically use industry-standard, vendor-neutral ports and connectors.

USB Type-C

USB Type-C (see Figure 24-36), the newest iteration of USB connectors, is quickly becoming the de facto standard port on Android devices today, which is awesome because you can use one charger for your laptop and phone. As we touched on earlier, Apple has gradually adopted USB-C for its iPad lineups since 2018 due to its compatibility with a huge number of peripherals and its higher power handling that provides faster charging.

Figure 24-36  USB Type-C connector

Like the Lightning connector, the USB Type-C connector is not keyed, allowing it to be inserted right-side up or upside down. It can (but doesn't have to) support USB 3.1 technology with very fast data transfer rates of up to 10 Gbps. Don't assume Type-C is synonymous with a specific version of USB---some devices using a Type-C connector are using it with USB 2.0.

EXAM TIP   You will likely see micro- and mini-USB, USB-C, and Lightning mobile device connection types on the exams. Know their characteristics and differences.

Bluetooth

While we discussed Bluetooth at some length, including configuring and pairing, in Chapter 20, let's review an outline of how the process will work on a mobile device. You can pair a Bluetooth device with a mobile device using a simple process that begins with enabling Bluetooth on the mobile device (if it isn't already enabled). Steps vary, but you can accomplish this in the quick settings menu or the full device settings menu. Next, power on the other Bluetooth device (or ensure Bluetooth is enabled if the device is already on). Return to the mobile device to discover and select the Bluetooth device for pairing, and then enter the appropriate personal identification number (PIN) code (see Figure 24-37). To add Bluetooth speakers, for example, the smartphone or tablet will display a set of characters for you to type on the keyboard. Once you type in the PIN code, the devices connect.

Figure 24-37  Prompting for PIN

EXAM TIP   Not all Bluetooth pairings require a PIN code, but there's always some kind of pairing action to perform on both devices.

Always remember to test the connectivity between a mobile device and a newly added Bluetooth accessory. If you've added a speaker, open up your favorite music app or podcast and tap play to make sure it works.

EXAM TIP   Most mobile devices have Bluetooth discovery disabled by default to conserve battery life. An active search for devices to pair with uses electricity, as does completed pairing, so use Bluetooth only when you need to use it and be prepared for the battery hit.

NFC

Near Field Communication (NFC) uses chips embedded in mobile devices that create electromagnetic fields when these devices are close to each other. The typical range for NFC communications is anywhere from a very few centimeters to only a few inches. The devices must be very close to or touching each other, and can be used to exchange contact information, small files, and even payment transactions through stored credit cards using systems like Apple Pay and Google Pay. This technology is seeing widespread adoption in newer mobile devices, as well as the infrastructures and applications that support them. Tap pay devices are increasingly common, using NFC and your phone so your credit cards stay in your wallet or purse.

Magnetic Readers and Chip Readers

Merchants can attach a magnetic reader or a chip reader to a smartphone to enable very quick credit card transactions via the cellular network. Vendors appreciate the portability of credit card readers, for example, which take credit card payments from a mobile device for goods and/or services rendered (see Figure 24-38). It's not unusual to see a food truck use a portable credit card reader plugged into the headphone port on an iPad, or being used at the Texas Renaissance Festival to take the Totalsem crew's money when they dressed up and went to play (see Figure 24-39). Cheers!

Infrared

Now largely replaced by other, faster technologies, such as Bluetooth and 802.11 wireless, infrared (IR) was previously used to transfer data between mobile devices, such as laptops and some older PDAs. Infrared was used to create the first real personal area networks (PANs). Infrared uses the wireless Infrared Data Association (IrDA) standard, and at one time was widely used to connect devices such as wireless remotes, printers, wireless mice, digitizers, and other serial devices. IrDA requires line of sight, meaning that devices have to be directly facing each other, requires very short distances (sometimes inches) between devices, and has very slow data rates.

EXAM TIP   You may have noticed that CompTIA included serial interfaces on the A+ 1101 objectives. A serial interface is a connection that sends data one bit at a time. The venerable RS232 port found on legacy devices is one example, but infrared is also a type of serial interface. You can also get adapters to convert another port into a serial port, and these exist for many different types of devices. Keep all of these possible types of serial interfaces in mind because you may see them on the exam.

Hotspots and Tethering

A mobile hotspot is a small device that shares access to cellular technologies such as 4G, 4G LTE via Wi-Fi, and 5G. Most of these devices can be purchased from wireless providers such as Verizon, Sprint, AT&T, T-Mobile, or other carriers, and are usually specific to their type of broadband network. A mobile hotspot is basically a wireless router that routes traffic between Wi-Fi devices and broadband technologies, providing wireless access for up to five to ten devices at a time.

Depending upon the carrier, many cellular phones, as well as tablets, can act as portable hotspots. You'll recall this from Chapter 21. When used in this manner, it's called tethering to the cell phone. While some devices configured as hotspots can use your existing data plan with your carrier, some carriers separate out and limit the amount of data that can be used for tethering.

To configure a device as a hotspot, you typically enable its cellular data connection and turn on an additional hotspot setting that causes the device to broadcast a Wi-Fi network. Now the mobile device serves as a router between the cellular network and the traditional Wi-Fi network it is broadcasting. Then any devices that you wish to tether to the hotspot simply see the device as a wireless router. You can also configure a password so that not just anyone can connect to the hotspot. Figure 24-40 shows a screenshot of an Android phone serving as a portable hotspot.

Accessories

Mobile device accessories come in a wide variety of types, packing a huge range of features. Some of the most common accessories that people want for their mobile device, particularly smartphones and tablets, include devices that wirelessly connect to them, typically using Bluetooth technologies. It's not unusual to find Bluetooth headsets and high-quality external speakers for users to listen to music and chat with friends.

Game controllers, including gamepads and other accessories that plug into tablets via a USB port or connect via Bluetooth, are also common, effectively turning tablets into full-scale gaming platforms. Additionally, cloud gaming has started to materialize as a viable option, and people are now able to use some mobile devices to stream their console and PC games and play on the go.

One feature that some Android mobile devices offer is the ability to use removable external storage, such as miniSD or microSD memory cards, effectively upgrading the storage capacity of the device. This is something Apple hasn't embraced with its devices, and in fact has become less common with Android devices as well.

There are also accessories no mobile device user should be without, including an external power bank or a phone or device charger. To recharge mobile devices, device chargers either plug into a wall outlet and the mobile device, or plug into a computer and the mobile device, while power banks are just portable batteries that you can charge up and plug your phone or tablet into to get some extra juice when you don't have the ability to plug into the wall.

Some chargers don't require connection to the device at all; they simply require you to lay the device on top of a special pad that recharges the battery wirelessly. Specifics differ a little depending on whether the device was designed for wireless charging or the capability is being added with an aftermarket kit---but in either case the pad creates an electromagnetic field for transmitting power to an antenna in the device. Despite being a wireless technology, the range is measured in centimeters and charging works best when the mobile device is on the pad.

The marketplace has settled on the Qi (pronounced "chee") standard from the Wireless Power Consortium (WPC) as the wireless charging standard of choice. Apple's 2017 decision to adopt the Qi standard and become a member of that consortium sealed the fate of early rival standards. Apple has even expanded wireless charging functionality to include power banks for some iPhone models.

Some devices also have specialized accessories, including docking stations (much like the docks discussed for portables in Chapter 23). Although these docking stations are typically used for tablets, they are also used for credit card readers.

Another important accessory is a case for the device. These include an almost unimaginable variety of designer cases, as well as hardened cases designed to withstand falls and other impacts. There also screen protectors---protective covers---that range from flimsy plastic all the way to hardened glass that can protect a mobile device screen from scratches and impact. You can find cases made of plastic, leather, rubber, wood, metal, and unicorn horn. Some of these cases are even waterproof, allowing the more adventurous folks to take their phones with them while they are diving in oceans or river-rafting.

We've covered only a few of the hundreds of accessories that are available for mobile devices. Many accessories also come with apps to help control or get the most out of the accessory.

CHAPTER 25

Maintaining and Securing Mobile Devices

In this chapter, you will learn how to

-   Troubleshoot common mobile device and application issues

-   Explain basic mobile device security

-   Describe typical mobile OS and application security issues

Mobile devices are packed with tightly integrated hardware, aren't designed to be upgraded by their users, and come with mobile-oriented operating systems. Because of these major differences, the troubleshooting and security practices for mobile devices differ a lot from those for desktop computers, and somewhat from those for other portable devices. This chapter explores general troubleshooting of mobile devices and their apps first, then covers security features and capabilities of devices common in the mobile market. The chapter finishes by jumping into preventing, detecting, and addressing security issues with mobile operating systems and applications. CompTIA loves those performance-based scenario questions, so get ready for some real-world issues when it comes to security and application troubleshooting.

1101/1102

Troubleshooting Mobile Device Issues

The CompTIA A+ exam objectives divide mobile device problems into two groups: general issues with mobile device hardware and software (1101 exam), and security issues (1102 exam) with the mobile OS and apps. In this section we're going to cover tools for troubleshooting general hardware, OS, and app issues, and apply these tools to common problems. These common problems happen across all varieties, types, and manufacturers of mobile devices. This chapter includes references to Apple's iOS and iPadOS, as well as Google Android. We talked about the differences between iOS and iPadOS in Chapter 24, and while they are very similar, there are some areas where troubleshooting may differ, so keep both their similarities and differences in mind.

NOTE   Few mobile devices have components you can service in the field. In the event of a hardware problem, send the device to a service center for repair. Companies like iFixit (https://www.ifixit.com) are making some components field-replaceable, but usually only for skilled techs.

Troubleshooting Tools

Because mobile device hardware typically can't be repaired or replaced by a user or field tech, mobile device troubleshooting focuses on ruling out software issues. The few things you can try are common to almost all mobile devices, and it's best to start with ones that inconvenience the user least. Sometimes these tools will fix the problem, but other times they'll just restore normal functionality until the problem recurs, or help you rule out causes.

Just because you'll troubleshoot a mobile device a little differently doesn't mean you should throw out what you already know. Reflect on the troubleshooting methodology covered in Chapter 1, and use the troubleshooting tools you learn about here to help you work through that process. If the troubleshooting process doesn't fix the problem or identify a cause you can resolve in-house, the next step is to take or send the device to an authorized service center.

Keep in mind that the steps you'll need to take to perform any of these operations will depend on the specific device, its operating system, and the OS version. Be prepared to consult manufacturer and OS resources for exact steps. Let's dive in.

NOTE   Most of these tools either are guaranteed to erase data and customizations or have some risk of doing so under the right circumstances. Remember to communicate with the device's user what steps you'll be taking, including what kinds of data loss it can entail, and give the user a chance to back up his or her data.

Try This!

Practice on the Real Deal

If you have access to a smartphone or tablet, practice getting to the tools used for troubleshooting mobile devices. You're going to read about a bunch of places to adjust things such as screen brightness, close or uninstall apps, and much more. Access the device's Settings and explore. Just don't do anything specifically to any device without proper permissions.

Check and Adjust Configuration/Settings

Modern mobile operating systems have tons of configurable settings, as do many of the apps users install on them. Always be on the lookout for "problems" that sound a lot like a simple configuration issue and investigate these early if they seem likely. It won't cost you much (except time) to check relevant settings, but it might save you from having to perform later steps that require backing up and restoring user data.

If the issue isn't likely related to configuration, save your time and revisit configuration after you've tried rebooting the device, which we'll discuss in the upcoming "Soft Reset" section; you don't want to waste tons of time toggling settings if a reboot could fix the problem. If you find a setting that doesn't seem right and want to see if a change resolves the issue, make sure to keep track of what you changed and what the previous setting was!

Close Running Apps

All of the mobile operating systems provide at least one way to close running applications---the most common is to swipe the app in a particular direction from the device's list of recent apps. If you come at this with a traditional mindset shaped by how desktop operating systems work, there's a chance you'll misunderstand when and why we close mobile apps, so let's consider a much-simplified version of what goes on under the hood.

On a traditional computer, you open an application when you need it, and it will run until it completes its work, crashes, or you close it. Because mobile devices have more limited computing resources and battery power, you don't want open apps eating up big chunks of resources and burning power while they aren't in focus or the device isn't even being used. To address this problem, modern mobile OS versions manage running apps to optimize performance and battery life.

The catch is that the way they manage apps makes the term "running" a little slippery. While your current app may be running in the traditional sense, the various processes that power your recent out-of-focus apps may keep running if they have work to do, be cached until you return to the app, or get killed if the OS needs its resources for other apps. For the most part the OS will do a good job of managing well-designed apps, but you may still need to close an app if it has frozen, begins to malfunction, or you suspect it is causing the device to misbehave.

NOTE   When closing an app, keep in mind that the user may lose unsaved data when you close it, and (depending on the app) that their device may lose certain functionality they expect it to have until the app is restarted.

Some apps may (intentionally or accidentally) leave background processes running even after the GUI has closed. In Android, the Application Manager will let you force stop an app, also killing its background processes (Figure 25-1). In iOS and iPadOS, a swipe will generally do the job.

Figure 25-1  Force stop in Android

Soft Reset

To maintain mobile devices, it's important to understand the terminology surrounding resets, especially if you're coming at this from a desktop-oriented mindset. On a desktop, you typically initiate a soft reboot from within the operating system or trigger it by pressing a button dedicated to restarting the system; the hallmark of a soft reboot is that the machine never powers all the way down. In contrast, you can perform a hard reboot by holding down the system's power button for several seconds until it turns completely off; you don't want to reboot this way if you can avoid it, but you'll need to if the system is frozen.

On mobile devices, the term soft reset describes restarting the device, whether you do it from within the OS or with hardware buttons on the device. If the device still won't restart, confirm the soft reset procedure in the manufacturer resources; if you know you're performing it correctly, and the device allows for it, you can force a device with a removable battery to power down by removing the back cover and the battery.

Much like a reboot on a traditional computer, you can fix all kinds of strange behavior on a mobile device with a soft reset. I'm listening to Spotify on my Android device as I write this section, for example, and when I got started this morning the playback was stopping every few songs; I performed a soft reset and now it's working fine. The soft reset is the easy reset, but there's another reset you need to know; we'll continue this discussion in the "Reset to Factory Default" section coming up in a moment.

Uninstall/Reinstall Apps

Uninstalling and reinstalling apps can be an important troubleshooting process. You can uninstall apps through either the app store they were installed with or the device's application manager; you can also, of course, reinstall them via the app store. If the user started having trouble shortly after installing a new app, uninstalling it to see if the problem goes away is an obvious way to rule out a potential cause. If they've been successfully using the app, make sure to jot down important settings and back up their data if possible before you uninstall it.

The problems you can fix or troubleshoot by uninstalling and reinstalling aren't always as obvious as this. If a user has had an app for a long time and it only recently started acting up, it's possible the app's developers released a bad update; after a bad update, the app might not work at all, or it might work fine if you uninstall and reinstall it. Sometimes this can be a no-win situation for a tech---what if the only fix to a user's problem is removing an app they use daily until its developers fix a problem?

Reset to Factory Default

This other reset---known by many names such as hard reset, factory reset, or reset to factory default---will clear all user data and setting changes, returning the device (well, its software) to the state it was in when it left the factory. Take extra care not to confuse a hard reset with a hard reboot; if you're reading documentation or a how-to page that uses the terms reboot and reset interchangeably, pay close attention to what the author intends you to do---and consider finding a less-ambiguous resource.

Because the hard reset removes all of a user's data and settings changes, it's the most disruptive option here---typically one you won't perform until after backing up the user's data (which we'll discuss later in the chapter). The big exception is when you're intentionally performing a factory reset in order to clear user data off a device before it is sold, recycled, or assigned to a new user.

Despite the inconvenience, resetting a device to factory defaults is an important troubleshooting step on the way to determining whether it should be sent to a service center. If a factory reset fixes the device's issues but they return some time after restoring a backup of user data and programs, return to earlier steps for tracking down the troublemaking app.

Touchscreen and Display Issues

Modern mobile devices are almost all screen, and some provide little beyond a touchscreen and a power button for interacting with the device. While display issues tend to be urgent for most devices, the touchscreen's integral role in controlling a modern mobile device makes it all the more so. We already touched on some important steps for troubleshooting a touchscreen in the "Input Problems" section at the end of Chapter 23, so be prepared to integrate those steps with the more mobile-centric issues discussed here.

Dim Display

Mobile devices have a brightness control that can be set to auto mode or controlled manually. These settings don't always work perfectly, and sometimes apps that need special control over brightness settings can cause the device's display to be too dark or bright for the user's comfort.

A dim display might be a sign that there's a problem with the panel, but first you need to check the display settings. Turn off any auto-adjustment setting and manually change the display brightness from the dimmest to brightest setting and observe whether it covers an appropriate range of output. If it doesn't, there may be a problem with the display panel; if it does, there may be something keeping the auto-adjustment from working right.

The auto-adjustment is affected by how much light a sensor or camera on the front of the device can detect. Make sure the sensor isn't covered with dirt or some other obstruction. If the display is too bright in a dim room, check the surroundings for bright light that isn't close enough to illuminate the area, but that the sensor might pick up if pointed in the right direction.

Be on the lookout for apps that tinker with the display's brightness. These apps may use distinct brightness settings, or they may modify system-wide brightness. Reading apps, like Amazon Kindle, are one example. See if a soft reset returns the display to normal operation, and then investigate whether using these apps causes the brightness issue to return. Every once in a while, Kindle on my Android tablet will interfere with the system's auto-brightness, causing all sorts of strange brightness changes until I restart the tablet by performing a soft reset. The solution in this case may be as simple as teaching the user to reset their device when an app like this has caused a problem.

Autorotation Problems

Much like brightness controls, mobile devices also have automatic and manual controls for rotating the screen. The autorotate mode uses the device's accelerometer to change the screen between portrait and landscape orientations when the user rotates the device. When the screen does not autorotate, usually either autorotation is off (the screen orientation is locked) or the app currently being used does not support both portrait and landscape orientations, which is necessary for autorotation to work.

You might also run into an autorotation problem caused by OS, resource, or hardware problems on the device. If autorotation doesn't work after a soft reset, you may need to wait for an OS update or take the device in for service.

Touchscreen Responsiveness

When a user tries to interact with a mobile device but finds the touchscreen nonresponsive or gets an inaccurate touchscreen response, there are a few simple things to rule out first: dirt, accidental touches, and performance issues. Any of these can cause digitizer issues (we talked about what a digitizer is in more detail in Chapter 24), some of which can be resolved quickly, others require specialist diagnostic and repair. With those out of the way, we'll turn to more catastrophic causes.

Accidental Touch  The simplest issue to resolve is an accidental touch. Sometimes a user will hold a device in such a way that its touchscreen detects some part of their arm or hand as an intentional touch, and it may not react at all when they try to manipulate it intentionally. Oversensitive sensors or bad design might exacerbate this, but the fix is always the same: show the user how the sensors pick up an accidental touch and teach them how to hold the device to avoid them.

Dirty Screen  Another simple issue to resolve is a dirty screen. Sometimes simply wiping the touchscreen down with a dry microfiber cloth to get rid of fingerprints, dust, dirt, grease, and other foreign objects will fix a responsiveness problem (see Figure 25-2).

Figure 25-2  Cleaning a smartphone

Performance Problems  Much like a mouse cursor may slow, freeze, or move erratically when a traditional computer is having performance issues, a touchscreen may appear not to work at all or have severe accuracy and response problems if the mobile device is performing poorly. Be patient with the device and look for signs it is struggling to keep up. Is it displaying the right time? If it has an animated lock screen or wallpaper, are the animations playing smoothly?

If the device appears to have network connectivity, are weather or stock widgets on the lock screen updating? Is it slow to respond when you press unrelated hardware buttons? If the device can receive them, see if it responds normally when you call or text it. If the problem seems to be performance related, perform a soft reset and see if the touchscreen starts working.

A lot of users add a screen protector to their mobile devices to give a little extra help in case of a drop. A poorly installed screen protector can cause touchscreens not to work properly. Check the guidelines from the manufacturer and remove and replace a subpar screen protector.

Calibration and Diagnostics  If a soft reset doesn't get the touchscreen working, look online for information about whether the device has a hidden diagnostics menu or service menu. You might reach this menu by inputting a series of digits into the device's dialer, or by holding specific buttons while the device is booting up during a soft reset. If the device has a touchscreen diagnostic here, it should help you decide whether the touchscreen itself is in good working order. Some Android devices may also have a setting in either the primary OS settings menu or a hidden device menu for calibrating the touchscreen.

Physical Damage  While we covered the previous issues when we discussed portable devices in Chapter 23, smaller mobile and wearable devices have a greater risk of some problems that are rarer with larger portables. Everyone knows a quick dip in a toilet, margarita glass, or swimming pool can kill a mobile device, but sometimes getting one wet or dropping it on a hard surface can cause trouble short of complete death. A smartphone in your pocket when you get caught in the rain, or on a table when you spill a drink, could end up with liquid in all sorts of nooks and crannies.

Although some mobile devices can handle a little bit of moisture, most can't handle immersion at all. Dropping a smartphone in a toilet makes for a very bad day. Without removable batteries, there's not much you can do to save a liquid-soaked mobile device, and as a result, this level of liquid damage is often a death sentence for mobile devices.

If you rule out the simplest explanations and fixes in this section and the touchscreen is still not responding properly, it's time to inspect the device for evidence it has been dropped or gotten wet. There's always the old-fashioned way---ask the user. Just be aware that it may be hard to get someone to admit their touchscreen stopped working after they sprayed milk through their nose because they tried to read XKCD while eating breakfast.

NOTE   For a good dose of tech-oriented humor, check out the comics at https://xkcd.org. Geeky fun at its finest!

A broken screen doesn't require the glass itself to be cracked; drops or impacts can break internal connections, rendering the device difficult or impossible to use. Moisture can cause internal shorts, and lingering liquid could cause sensors to behave in really strange ways. Most mobile devices will contain a few liquid contact indicator (LCI) stickers that change color when exposed to water, as shown in Figure 25-3. While these are really so the carrier or manufacturer can refuse to cover water damage under warranty, look up their locations online and then check them on the device. There's often one on the battery or in the battery compartment, if it's accessible; it'll usually be white if it hasn't gotten wet.

Apps Not Launching

A mobile device app may fail to launch or install correctly for a few reasons. First, the app may not be compatible with some combination of the mobile device's hardware, operating system version, or vendor/carrier customizations to the OS. With Android devices, for example, different manufacturers can tweak the OS to suit their own needs, which may cause compatibility issues with other vendors' apps.

NOTE   This section details reasons an app may always fail to launch or install correctly. Remember, an app may fail to install or launch correctly before you perform a soft reset, but do so fine afterward. Perform a soft reset and then try reinstalling and launching the app.

Another reason an app may not launch is that the device doesn't meet the app's hardware requirements. These might be more traditional requirements such as amount of available RAM, storage space, and processor type, but the app might also require a sensor or radio your device lacks or requires capabilities that your device's camera doesn't support. It's always a good idea to review an app's requirements before installing it (or when you run into trouble).

Both Apple and Android devices track errors with applications. You'll need third-party tools to access app log errors---or what I assume are logs of app errors (thanks, CompTIA!). Something to keep in mind if a senior tech or app programmer (in the case of custom apps for an organization) needs help with troubleshooting.

Overheating

Just as with the portable devices discussed in Chapter 23, overheating can cause permanent damage to a mobile device; most of the recommendations given there still apply. That said, our relationship with mobile devices is a little different. They are usually on, spend more time in our hands and pockets, and we take them places we wouldn't dream of taking a larger portable. A mobile device is more likely to get left on the car seat on a hot summer day or be nestled close to our body in well-insulated winter clothing.

Focus on overheating as a combination of the heat a mobile device produces itself, heat added to it by external sources like the sun or a lamp, and how well its environment dissipates or retains heat. Since we handle these devices more often, we have a lot of chances to notice what's normal and what isn't; when a device is hot, combine these three factors and see how well they explain the device's temperature. The process of looking for a good explanation can help you catch performance problems before they drain the battery, prevent heat damage to components, or identify problems with the battery or power systems before they become dangerous.

Charging, large data transfers, frozen apps, recording HD video, and other intensive tasks can all make a mobile device much hotter than normal; avoid letting the device do intense work in hot or well-insulated spaces. If you can avoid it, don't bring mobile devices into very hot environments; if you can't, minimize risk by turning the device off altogether. If the device is hot to the touch in a cool environment, you can put it into airplane mode, close all running programs, and see if it cools down. If it doesn't, turn it off until it cools and then try again.

Your biggest concerns are a device that overheats for no obvious reason or gets hot enough that it could burn someone. These problems are usually caused by some sort of hardware issue, possibly a defective battery or other power circuit within the device. There's really not much you can do; turn it off to protect the device from further damage and take it to a service center.

The dangers of not addressing an overheating mobile device---even one that is overheating for otherwise benign reasons---are, at best, an eventual device failure and requisite data loss. At worst, a severely overheating device can become a safety risk with the potential to burn or shock a user and, especially if the battery ruptures, cause a fire or explosion.

Update Failures

Ideas like app stores and regular automatic updates are now common on computer operating systems, but these things cut their teeth in the world of iPhone, Android, and even the failed Windows Phone. Ease of use rules this world, so installing software and updates on a mobile device is dead simple. But don't think it's too simple to fail! If you manage enough mobile devices, you'll see a case where the OS fails to update or an application fails to update.

Usually, the reason an update fails is that the device doesn't have enough free space to install the update. It might auto-purge some files to make room, but you'll have to jump in to remove some apps or files (back them up first) if it fails. Corrupt downloads won't install; check your device's documentation on how to delete the bad update and retry with a strong connection. Running out of battery mid-update can cause big trouble; it's best to plug in the device before updating the OS.

Slow Response

Mobile devices can be slow to respond like regular desktop computers and laptops, and often for the same reasons. Response issues can be caused by storage space being almost filled up on a mobile device, making it unable to save data or install apps efficiently. Mobile devices can also be slow to respond when there are too many apps running at the same time, eating up RAM.

Usually, the mobile device's OS has configuration settings that enable you to stop apps or view their resource usage, including memory and storage space. If storage space is an issue, you may have to uninstall some apps, or reinstall them so that they are stored on removable storage devices, such as microSD or miniSD memory cards.

A device with response issues will often be running hot, and this heat can be a big clue. Use the recommendations in the previous section to evaluate whether the device or the environment is the source of this heat. A hot, sluggish device could be using thermal throttling to protect the device's CPU from heat damage by reducing its power; in this case, performance should pick up as it cools.

One of the first troubleshooting steps you can take in resolving response issues is to perform a soft reset of the device; this clears running apps---perhaps even ones that are frozen or malfunctioning---from RAM. As far as troubleshooting tools go, you can use the device settings or third-party apps to measure the device's performance. Sometimes those apps can help point the way to what's causing the performance problems. If you ultimately determine that a hardware issue is causing performance problems, you should take the device to an authorized repair facility.

Battery Life

Just like the portable devices discussed in Chapter 23, modern mobile devices use Lithium-Ion (Li-Ion) batteries. It's usually not too hard to make use of a more traditional portable computer while it's charging, but the ergonomics of mobile devices can make it miserable to use one while it's charging---so it's even more important to make sure your device has power when you need it. Our purpose here is to look at how you can manage any battery to get the most out of it, but first we need to talk about the cornerstone of good battery management.

Meeting User Power Needs

Mobile devices are rated in terms of how long their battery should power a device during "normal" use, how long the device can go between battery charges, and the levels of power that both the battery provides and requires in order to charge. Make sure you and your users have mobile devices that have a chance to last long enough to perform normal activities for an adequate amount of time.

The battery life numbers advertised by a device's maker are a good start, but be suspicious of these figures. Mobile device review sites will benchmark the performance of more popular mobile devices and tell you how long they survived while performing some battery-sucking tasks like playing HD video. Know how long a given user's device will need to last on a charge, and try to make sure they get a device that can last at least 20 percent longer to account for how the battery's capacity will dwindle over its lifetime, known as its battery life.

If there's no existing device that can meet the user's needs most of the time, make sure they either have a device with a removable battery and a spare or have a portable external battery recharger. You can plug a mobile device into a portable battery recharger (sometimes called external battery, power pack, or portable charger) to recharge when there's no available outlet.

Managing Battery Life

There are two ways to think about battery life: how long it will last on each charge, and how long the battery can meet your needs before you have to replace it. Luckily, you can optimize both of these at the same time. When you waste battery life on device features you aren't using, not only will your device need to recharge sooner than necessary, but the extra recharge cycles will also shorten the useful life of your battery, also known as your battery health. Let's take a look at the biggest battery drains while keeping in mind that these are generalizations: check your device's battery usage monitor to see what is consuming most of its power.

Display  While it depends somewhat on how big your device's screen is and what kind of display it uses, the fastest way to drain most modern mobile devices is leaving the screen on. Keep the display off when you can, and use the lowest acceptable brightness setting. Because the screens look so much more vibrant at full brightness, there's a good chance this will be their default setting. The battery savings from using the lowest setting may be enticing, but the best compromise is usually to configure the device to control brightness automatically. Figure 25-4 displays the battery usage for an iPhone 13 Pro. Notice how much of the battery is being drained by the screen alone!

Figure 25-4  Battery usage for a smartphone

There are more options for optimizing how much power your display uses, though some of these differ by device or manufacturer. You can usually adjust how long the screen will stay on without input, and whether it will turn on when you receive a notification. Some devices have power-saving modes and may even be able to save power by displaying grayscale instead of full color. OLED displays use less power to display darker colors; if your device uses an OLED panel, you can also reduce power consumption by using black wallpapers and configuring apps to use a dark theme if the option is available.

Wireless Communication  To paint with a very broad brush, another big battery drain is the process of communicating without wires. It's good to keep in mind that every form of wireless communication your mobile device is capable of (such as cellular voice, cellular data, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, Near-Field Communication [NFC], etc.) corresponds to a radio inside the device. In order to use that type of communication, the radio needs to be on and drawing power. If you aren't actively using that mode of communication but the radio is on, you're wasting power. Each communication technology draws varying amounts of energy under different circumstances, but here are two helpful guidelines: searching for signals is power intensive, and your device's apps will do more work in the background when connections are available.

Especially when traveling outside of populated areas, a mobile device can use lots of power talking with distant towers and base stations; this constant search can significantly drain battery power. You may be able to control this power drain through configuration changes that limit device roaming or searching for new wireless networks, but another approach is disabling these communications technologies until you need them or are back in an area with good coverage. You don't want to get stuck in the snow on a rural highway only to discover that your phone has almost completely drained its battery searching for cellular signals.

Even when the device maintains a strong connection, it constantly uses power to transmit and receive data. Having the connection available is often worth this slow drain, but beware that some of your apps will lightly sip power while disconnected and burn through much more doing background work when a connection is present. The easy way to rein this in is to disable communication, but the operating system (and sometimes the app itself) will have settings for controlling when an app can send and receive data in the background, and what connections it can use.

Location  While you can apply the same guidelines for managing GPS or location services, some small differences make it worth discussing separately. When location services are on, the device's apps can query the location of the device. Depending on how you've configured the device, it may approximate your location using low-power (less-accurate) methods like nearby cellular and Wi-Fi networks, higher-accuracy (higher-power) methods like GPS, or combine both of these. This could be for apps that require location data in the background, or for active apps, such as mapping software, that use the GPS receiver. The power drain here can vary widely between an app occasionally checking approximate location in the background, and one constantly requesting high-quality updates.

The simplest solution is to keep location services off when they aren't required, but you may be able to find a happy medium by setting per-app restrictions. When an app requires location data (common examples are apps for navigating, mapping, geocaching, or finding nearby users, restaurants, garage sales, or movie theaters) but location is disabled, the device will usually prompt you to turn it on.

Because apps for which location data is less critical may happily use a stale location, the best combination of trade-offs will ultimately depend on how you use your device and what apps you have running. If you regularly use the device to take location-tagged pictures cataloging graffiti or potholes, you may want the highest quality location data available at all times, regardless of the battery drain. Another tip is to review configuration settings for apps that use location services and disable the ones that don't need to have immediate location data.

EXAM TIP   Be familiar with the factors that can reduce battery power and battery life.

Charging Issues

Charging a mobile device is one of the most regular interactions a user will have with it. As a result, charging issues can arise, leading to inconvenience and frustration. There are a range of possible causes for improper charging, from something as simple as having too many apps running in the background, all the way to broken hardware in the device. Depending on the source of the problem, the device may charge slowly or not at all. Let's have a look at some of the main causes, how to identify them, and most importantly, how to fix them.

If your device is charging more slowly than usual, there are a few possibilities. The first thing to check is whether anything is using an unusually high amount of battery. Sometimes, resolving the issue is as simple as closing out of some background apps.

Slow charging can also be caused by issues with your charger or cable. If the charger you're using wasn't designed with the device in mind, or you're just using a cable you grabbed out of a drawer, it may not be able to provide enough power. You'll know fairly quickly if the phone is charging slowly; most devices display the estimated charging time somewhere, either on the home screen or in the battery menu in Settings. If you encounter slow charging and you've ruled out background apps, grab a different charger, preferably one that you know works with the device. If it charges normally, the issue was almost certainly with the charger or cable. If it doesn't, you may have bigger problems and should look to the device hardware.

NOTE   In Chapter 24 we talked about different types of ports you'll find on smartphones and tablets. Issues related to charging cables are especially common, particularly for smartphones, because people often use their devices while they are plugged in. The result is that the cables can end up fraying, or the connector can become damaged. If a charging cable that worked well suddenly starts charging slowly, it's very possible that it just didn't hold up to the higher amount of wear and tear mobile devices experience. If the cable is micro-USB, the odds of this being the problem are especially high.

If you've already ruled out issues with background battery usage, chargers, and cables, it's time to explore the possibility that the charging port itself has a problem. For example, you may have a physically damaged port. This is the worst-case scenario, because, as we discussed when we addressed field repair, mobile device hardware repair is very difficult without access to specialized tools and parts. If you closed out the extraneous apps, restarted the device, tested a few different charging cables, and the device still won't charge, there's really one more thing that you can test before its time to take it to a specialist. It may sound silly but try plugging the charger into a different outlet. I've plugged in my charger to one outlet, felt the creeping despair that comes with potential hardware issues, moved it to another outlet, and had the device charge normally. Sometimes the issue isn't with the device at all. If none of these steps work though, the device may require some form of specialized diagnostic or repair.

Swollen Battery

As we discussed in Chapter 23, one of the more insidious problems you'll see in mobile devices is a swollen battery. The main cause is overcharging, usually when the circuits designed to prevent overcharging fail. Non-OEM chargers or batteries, especially if they aren't rated for the correct voltage and wattage, represent an additional risk, as does overheating. Sometimes the battery is just bad. Overcharging has become less common as mobile device manufacturers continue to improve their hardware and implement software that helps to prevent it, but swollen batteries can still be a serious problem.

Prevention may be the best cure. Don't let batteries overheat, especially while charging. Prefer OEM chargers and batteries. Check the manufacturer's documentation for specific actions to take or avoid. Regardless, prevention can't always work, and swollen batteries may rupture, leak, and catch fire. It's important to be aware it can happen, vigilant for signs it is occurring, and careful when disposing swollen batteries.

Look for subtle clues, like changes in how the device's frame and screen come together, how it sits on a flat surface, how the back cover sits on the device, weird creaking or popping, inexplicable heat, and so forth. If the device has a removable cover, it's pretty simple to check the battery. If it doesn't, you may need to find a service center or a mobile technician who is comfortable taking the device apart to check.

When you encounter a swollen battery, dispose of it according to the recommendations in the "Try This! Recycling Old Portable Device Batteries" section of Chapter 23 and replace it with a known-good battery, preferably from the original device vendor.

CAUTION   You should never try to repair a battery under any circumstances, let alone when it's swollen, as it can cause bodily harm and damage to equipment.

Random Reboots and Freezes

A mobile device can randomly reboot or freeze up just like a desktop system (and for the same reasons). The main difference is that there aren't as many ways to successfully deal with a frozen mobile device. In that case, the immediate goal is getting the device back to a usable state. If the device isn't responding, you'll need to perform a soft reset, and without access to the OS you'll have to follow the manufacturer's steps for performing a soft reset---probably either by holding the power button for a few seconds or removing the battery.

NOTE   When a device seems to be frozen, there's also a chance the touchscreen just isn't responding. Check if the device responds normally to hardware button presses or enabled voice and gesture commands before assuming it is frozen.

If the device is still at least partially responsive, you can try to close an offending process from your list of recent apps. Even if you get the app to close, you may find the device unstable again as soon as you reopen the app. It's often best to save yourself wasted time: close the offending app, save any work in other open apps, and perform a soft reset.

When the device is usable again, there may be more steps to take. If you know the device rebooted or froze when you opened a newly installed or updated app, you may need to uninstall it and consider waiting for an update or looking for a replacement. Sometimes operating system issues can cause reboots and freezes, especially right after a device update, so look for follow-up OS patches correcting these types of issues. If the device randomly (and with increased frequency) reboots or freezes up, whenever using apps performing similar tasks (any app that uses the GPS or camera, for example), then your device likely has a hardware issue and needs service.

There's also a chance you'll find that the device is still unusable after the soft reset, in which case you'll need to look for the manufacturer's documentation on how to boot the device into any special modes that enable you to either remove an offending app, repair the OS installation, or reset the device to factory default. If this process also fails to render the device stable, you'll need to send it to a service center.

Cannot Broadcast to an External Monitor

Back in Chapter 24 we saw that some mobile devices have video output that enables you to broadcast the display onto an external monitor or projector. When done correctly, this is usually an almost automatic process: plug some adapter into your mobile device, plug that adapter into your external monitor's VGA, DVI, DP, or HDMI port, and it all just works.

Well, that's the theory. In reality, broadcasting your mobile device's screen to an external monitor is fraught with problems. While these vary by type of device, here are a few tried-and-true things to check when your device cannot broadcast to an external monitor:

-   Is your source correct on the external monitor? All monitors, TVs, and projectors have lots of inputs. Is the external monitor pointing at the right source?

-   Do you have the right adapter for your device? Apple alone has come out with five different types of video adapters in the last few years---and don't even get me started on the many adapters for Android! Make sure you have an adapter that is known to work for your device.

-   Does your adapter need its own power source?

-   For HDMI: Did the HDMI recognize your device and your external monitor? Depending on the make and model, you may need to reset one or both devices to give the HDMI time to see connections and set itself up.

No Sound from Speakers

Sound issues are also common on mobile devices. The most obvious (and probably most common) is that the volume was turned down or muted through software configuration or an app. This is easy to fix, but sometimes you have to go through many configuration settings for both the device and apps to figure out which one is controlling the volume at the moment or which one may actually be muting the speakers. A device may have separate settings for media, call volume, notifications, and more---and sometimes it's easy to change the wrong one.

The versatile nature of mobile devices means that we are often switching from one use to another. This can sometimes lead to people forgetting that their device was paired with some peripheral. One of the most common peripherals you'll see with mobile devices are wireless Bluetooth headphones. If you aren't getting any sound from the speakers, it may be a good idea to double-check for paired audio devices---the sound may just be coming from somewhere you didn't expect.

Some mobile devices also have hardware volume controls on them, so check them. If that doesn't work, then start going into the configuration settings for the device and apps. If none of these steps works, then you may have a hardware issue: the speakers have been damaged or come disconnected inside the device. As with all other hardware issues, you'll likely have to take the device to a service center for repair.

Connectivity and Data Usage Issues

General network connectivity issues---the kind that can affect all devices---have been covered elsewhere within the book. For mobile devices in particular, you should be aware of some additional network connectivity issues that you will likely encounter at some point. We'll discuss these in respect to cellular signals, but the first issue applies to Wi-Fi and Bluetooth network connections as well. For the most part you can't directly fix these connection issues, but you'll inevitably find a connection issue is responsible for some problem, or at least need to rule it out on the way to the ultimate cause.

One of the most prominent connection issues plaguing mobile devices is weak signal. The signal might be weak because you're deep inside a building, nestled between skyscrapers, crossing the no-man's-land between cell towers in sparsely populated areas, or any of a wide array of similar situations. The primary symptoms of a weak signal are dropped connections, delays, slow transmission speeds, battery drain, and frequent indications that the device is searching for a signal.

There isn't much you can do to troubleshoot a weak signal except monitor it. There are cellular signal boosters you can purchase, but these are of dubious value in some situations. These are most effective when the user is stationary in a location far from the cell tower, and usually aren't useful while the user is on the move.

NOTE   In addition to signal issues, performance problems on the device itself can cause the symptoms of slow data connectivity. We've covered these already, but they include high utilization of resources such as CPU, RAM, and network bandwidth, and a device's struggle to maintain a solid network connection.

Even if your signal is good, you may still run into connectivity problems---and they may be tricky to spot if you aren't aware of them. The first of these is an overloaded network, which is common during large public gatherings (such as a sporting event) or a widespread emergency that causes a surge in network use. Your device might have full bars but be unable to place calls, send texts, or transfer data. Another explanation for connectivity problems despite a strong signal are restrictions and limits the carrier enforces. You may experience slow data speeds while roaming just because the carrier of the network you are roaming on limits data rates for nonsubscribers. Exceeding the data usage limits that your carrier sets can also lead to slow data speeds.

The carrier will usually notify the user by e-mail or text message, but the user might not notice. What happens next is up to the carrier and the terms of the user's plan. Some carriers stop cellular data use beyond the preset limits, bill the user for additional data, or throttle the speed of the connection. Each causes complications, but you can minimize them by recognizing data caps. Configure data hogs like cloud storage apps to synchronize only on Wi-Fi, monitor data use and disable cellular data usage in the configuration settings of the device (see Figure 25-5) as needed, or pay to raise the data cap.

Figure 25-5  Option to disable cellular data in iOS

While the abstract side of data usage limits is important, the essential part is that you think about how these various scenarios could manifest on real devices. If you have a corporate plan, knowing the data limits and what happens when they're exceeded will give you a big leg up. What should you suspect when a user turns up at the end of the month with a device that suddenly has terrible call quality in Skype while using cellular data but works fine over Wi-Fi? Or a traveling employee says she keeps getting calls from colleagues asking why she hasn't weighed in on an important e-mail discussion that hasn't turned up on her device, despite a good connection? A quick check to see whether the user is over the plan limit could spare both of you hours of troubleshooting.

GPS and Location Services Problems

Sometimes the location services on mobile devices will be better at finding where you aren't than where you are. Some inaccuracy can be explained by the hardware a device has available; a Wi-Fi-only tablet with no GPS can get only a general location.

Symptoms of location issues can vary depending on what apps are trying to use location services. Photos might end up tagged with the wrong location, or the coffee shop you picked because it was closest might actually be further away than your device suggests. A navigation app might have trouble identifying your location at all, or it might be sure it knows where you are even when you know you're blocks away. Other symptoms can include prompts and error or informational messages from the OS or apps that rely on location data (see Figure 25-6).

Figure 25-6  GPS prompt

Troubleshooting location problems begins with simple actions such as making sure that your GPS, cellular data, and Wi-Fi are turned on and functioning properly, as sometimes these services can be inadvertently turned off by the user or by an app, and have to be periodically reactivated. Typically, a warning message will indicate that GPS or data services are turned off, so this is easy to identify and fix. Specific apps may have trouble if they are configured not to access or use location services. This is usually a matter of going into the app configuration or location settings and allowing the app to make use of those services.

EXAM TIP   If you run into GPS error questions on the exam, remember that all apps will tell you if GPS is turned off and usually ask you if want to turn on GPS. Otherwise, before digging deeper, first consider simple issues such as whether you are in a place where you can get a good GPS signal.

Once you've checked the obvious software reasons for location trouble, it's a good idea to think about the physical environment before you go on a wild-goose chase. GPS won't work underground, will probably be spotty indoors unless you're near a window, and can really struggle in dense urban areas with tall buildings. Don't be spooked into a long search for subtle GPS problems if your device occasionally has trouble deciding which downtown street you're strolling along.

When you're sure there are frequent location problems unexplained by the environment, it's time to dig deeper. Along with the OS issues discussed previously, incorrect OS configuration settings for GPS, cellular, and Wi-Fi services may prevent location services from functioning properly. These configuration items should be checked when multiple apps are having location issues.

If the issues persist, there's a good chance the problem is in the actual GPS or network hardware inside the device, or the OS code that interfaces with it. Look online to see if other device owners report similar trouble on the same device software versions. If you don't see other reports of trouble, the device likely needs a trip to the service center. Although mobile devices may have removable network or GPS modules in them, most of these components are not user serviceable and have to be replaced or repaired by authorized service technicians.

Encryption Problems

Methods to secure e-mail messages from anyone but the intended recipient generally fall well outside the accepted parameters of the CompTIA A+ certification, but it's useful to know how to troubleshoot mobile device encryption issues. To understand the issue, we'd need to dive into a number of topics you won't see until you take the CompTIA Security+ exam. Instead, let's focus on the basics.

For an e-mail message to be secure, it must be encrypted---scrambled according to some kind of standard, such as Pretty Good Privacy (PGP) or Secure/Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions (S/MIME). For the recipient to read the e-mail message, he or she needs to have software that can unscramble or decrypt the message. To ensure the sender and recipient alone can access the contents of the e-mail message, both people need specific keys that enable encryption and decryption. A key is a string of bits used by a computer program to encrypt or decrypt data.

In practice, there are a few reasons a mobile device won't be able to decrypt an e-mail. The simplest of these is that the e-mail client or application doesn't support the encryption standard used to encrypt the message; the fix may be a plug-in or an entirely new client. Once you confirm that the e-mail client or app supports this encryption method, follow any steps for configuring the client to use it. Finally, the e-mail client will need access to keys for decrypting the message. With some standards, keys may always be exchanged manually; someone will need to contact the sender to exchange keys. In other cases, keys may be exchanged automatically in at least some circumstances (if you're part of the same organization, for example).

Securing Mobile Devices

Just like any computer we use to input or access sensitive data and network resources, we need to secure our mobile devices. Whether the device is company owned or personal, we still need to protect ourselves from the needless inconvenience of easily prevented damage, theft, or malware infections, as well as from the chance of important data being lost completely or falling into the wrong hands.

BYOD Versus Corporate-Owned Devices

The bring your own device (BYOD) war was briefly fought and lost by organizations hoping to continue the long-held tradition that IT assets belonged to (and were strictly controlled by) the company, not the individual. As mobile devices proliferated, however, IT folks realized the genie was out of the bottle; they couldn't control these new technologies completely. Some companies enforce a policy prohibiting the use of personal devices to access corporate data and resources, particularly in high-security environments. Companies at the other end of the spectrum allow (and even encourage) the use of personal devices to save corporate IT dollars and keep employees happy.

Most organizations fall in the middle of the spectrum and have a mixed environment with both corporate-owned and employee-owned mobile devices. Some organizations institute a cost-sharing program, subsidizing an employee's personally owned device with a monthly phone stipend or discount agreement with mobile device and telecommunications vendors. Regardless of how comfortable an organization is with BYOD, there are important questions to answer.

One question is how much control the corporation has versus the individual. If corporate data is processed or stored on the device, the organization should have some degree of control over it. On the other hand, if the device also belongs to the employee, then the employee should have some control. Another question is who pays for the device and its use. If the organization allows the user to use her own device for company work, does the organization help pay for the monthly bill or compensate the user for its use? Again, this issue is best solved via formal policy and procedures. Yet another important question in a BYOD environment is how to handle employee privacy. If policy allows the organization some degree of control over the device, what degree of privacy does the user maintain on her own device? Can the organization see private data, or have the ability to remotely access a user's personal device and control its use?

The proliferation of mobile devices in the workplace has led to the development of mobile device management (MDM) policies that often combine a specialized app on the devices and specialized infrastructure to deal with those devices. These policies also inform corporate versus end-user device configuration options; in other words, who should make configuration decisions on things such as e-mail, wireless access, and so forth. As you might imagine, MDM policies are a big deal at the big organization level (the enterprise) because of the scale and complexity of the issues. A CompTIA A+ technician comes in to facilitate the installation of the MDM app, for example, or to help fix key infrastructure problems (like an overloaded WAP because all 25 members of a department bought Apple Watches at the same time). Mobile device management isn't always necessary. Sometimes, the organization is concerned just with a specific app or group of apps. In this case, you'll find the use of mobile application management (MAM).

EXAM TIP   Both mobile device management and mobile application management are included in the CompTIA A+ exam objectives for a reason. They sound similar but serve different purposes. MDM is for entire devices, while MAM is for specific applications used by the organization. Keep this in mind so that you don't get them mixed up on the exams.

Profile Security Requirements

A profile is a collection of configuration and security settings that an administrator has created in order to apply those settings to particular categories of users or devices. A profile can be created in several different ways, including through the MDM software, or in a program such as the Apple Configurator, for example. Profiles are typically text-based files, usually in an eXtensible Markup Language (XML) format, and are pushed out to the different devices that require them. Profiles should be developed based on the needs of the organization. You can develop a profile specific to certain platforms, operating systems, or devices, so that a particular type of device will get certain settings.

You can also develop profiles that are specific to different user categories or management groupings (such as mobile sales representatives, middle managers, senior managers, and executives). Your senior organizational executives might have a specific profile applied to their devices granting them additional permissions and access to special apps or connections.

You might also apply group-specific profiles to external users, such as consultants or business partners. These users may require limited access to organizational resources using their own mobile device, their organization's mobile devices, or even mobile devices temporarily issued by your organization. A group-specific profile applied to these external users may give them particular network configuration and security settings so that they can access a business extranet, for example, or use specific VPN settings. They may also require access to particular enterprise or business-to-business (B2B) apps hosted on your organization's servers. In any case, both device- and user-specific profiles can be very helpful in managing larger groups of users, delivering uniform security and configuration settings to their devices based on different mission or business requirements.

Depending on your organizational needs, you could conceivably apply several different profiles to a device at once, based on platform, user group, and so forth. When multiple profiles are applied, there's a chance some settings will conflict. For example, some restrictive settings for a device profile may not be consistent with some less-restrictive ones in a group or user profile. When both are applied to the device, the different configuration settings may conflict and overwrite each other. The solution is to pay special attention to profile precedence and configure the MDM server to resolve conflicts using criteria such as user group membership or security requirements.

You should also develop profiles that apply to corporate-owned versus employee-owned devices. A profile applied to a device in a BYOD environment may be considerably different than one applied to a company-owned device. This would be based on policy settings affecting privacy, acceptable use of the device, and so on. Figure 25-7 shows how you can conceptually apply different profiles to different device and user groups.

Figure 25-7  Applying profiles to different device and user groups

Preventing Physical Damage

For something shaped a lot like a bar of soap and sometimes almost as slippery, mobile phones can cost a lot of money. That means you need to take steps to prevent damage. The first step you should take to protect your slippery investment is a case, protective cover, or sleeve for the mobile device. It doesn't help the HD camcorder in your new iPad if you get a scratch across the lens! You'll get a scratched, blurry movie even though the camcorder is capable of much, much more. Apple makes very nice covers for iPhones and iPads, plus you can get many third-party covers and sleeves (see Figure 25-8).

Figure 25-8  Putting an Apple Smart cover on an iPad

Depending on the amount of money you're willing to spend, you can get a cover that helps protect your screen from scratches, impacts, and small amounts of water. Like to scuba with your Android device? Get a specialty waterproof case and go post your deep thoughts to Facebook from 40 feet underwater.

Do the obvious to protect your devices. Don't get them anywhere near liquids. Don't run your smartphone through the wash in your trousers. Don't even think about placing heavy objects on that ~$600 tablet! Use common sense.

Combating Malware

Malware on mobile devices is an interesting issue. Tight controls on the OS and apps make traditional malware infections almost impossible on iOS and Android devices. When malware strikes, the OS maker supplies periodic OS updates, automatic updates and operating system patches. Android's more open nature means there are third-party antivirus and anti-malware single-user (user-level) and enterprise-level solutions available if you have corporate regulations that require such software. Figure 25-9 shows an example of user-level antivirus software for an Android device.

Figure 25-9  Antivirus app for Android

NOTE   We discuss operating system updates and their importance to security in detail in Chapter 27. Be aware that OS updates are just as important for mobile device security as they are for desktops and laptops.

In an ideal world, your mobile anti-malware software will cover all threats and work on all the devices used in your corporate network. In a heterogeneous real-world infrastructure, because there may be a variety of mobile devices from different vendors using different operating systems, a one-size-fits-all anti-malware solution probably won't work. Multiple solutions may be necessary for the different devices present on a network, or different modules covering specific types of devices may be available from the vendor to integrate with an enterprise-level anti-malware solution.

In any case, the most important part of an enterprise-level anti-malware solution is delivering timely updates to the devices on a routine basis. Network access control (NAC) solutions can ensure a device is checked for the latest anti-malware signatures and updated as necessary when it attempts to connect to the network. In the case of user-managed devices, you may need policy, NAC, and other technical solutions to ensure users are updating their own devices in a timely manner.

NOTE   Chapter 27 goes into much depth on malware, including the types of malware as well as the most common sources and symptoms of malware infections.

Dealing with Loss

The best way to make sure you're ready to survive losing a mobile device is to assume it's inevitable. Say it to yourself: every mobile device will get lost at least once. I hope most of your users will prove you wrong, but the odds are good we'll all misplace every device we own at least once. Most of us will be lucky and find it right where we left it, but it could just as easily go the other way.

When you start with the assumption that your device will end up at the mercy, kindness, or ignorance of strangers at least once, it's obvious: you should protect your data from access by putting a good screen lock on the device. Most mobile devices enable you to set a screen lock through Settings (see Figure 25-10). Do it right now! There are many types of these locks; the most common require you to input a password, PIN code, pattern, fingerprint, or successful facial recognition to unlock the mobile device so you can use it. Modern iOS and Android use device encryption to protect the built-in storage, so even a "finder" who dismantles the device to access the drive will not get your documents.

Figure 25-10  Passcode (screen lock) option in Settings

As we discussed in the "System Lockout" section earlier, mobile devices may also have failed login attempt restrictions which restrict the number of login attempts that can fail before system lockout occurs. This system lockout slows down someone trying to guess the passcode of a found mobile device while you use locator applications or services to recover or remotely wipe it.

EXAM TIP   For the purposes of the CompTIA A+ 1102 exam, know that fingerprint lock, facial recognition, pattern lock, swipe lock, and PIN code are screen lock methods used to secure mobile devices.

Apple and Google offer locator services for discovering the whereabouts of a misplaced mobile device. Using Apple's iCloud as an example, log in to your iCloud account and click the Find My iPhone button (despite the name, it also works for iPads). As soon as the device in question accesses the Internet (and thus receives an IP address and posts its MAC address), iCloud will pinpoint the location within a few yards (see Figure 25-11). Very slick!

Figure 25-11  Locating a phone in iCloud

Recovering from Theft

If your mobile device gets stolen and contains sensitive information, then you have a couple of options for dealing with it. Locator applications and services help, but if you have credit card information or other risky data on your mobile device, you need to act quickly.

First, make sure you keep your data backed up. You should have everything synced to a local machine and, if possible, backed up to one of the remote backup applications---like Microsoft's OneDrive cloud service---to put your data beyond the reach of even a disaster that takes out your house. With Apple devices, for example, you back up and restore with one of several services, such as iCloud or iTunes, or use the Apple Configurator to handle a fleet of iOS devices. Android devices use the Google Sync feature to back up and restore.

Second, you can remotely wipe your mobile device. Apple, for example, makes it supremely easy through your Apple account. Log in, locate, and nuke your device (see Figure 25-12). You may never get the device back, but at least the bad guys won't have your data. It's equally simple with Android devices. Log in and follow the same process---locate and nuke.

Figure 25-12  Erase iPad

Securing Your Data

Every security scenario we've discussed so far (remote wipe excepted) was designed to secure the device itself. Let's turn to how we can protect our actual data.

Multifactor Authentication

The terms multifactor and single-factor authentication make the difference obvious enough: the number of factors used to authenticate the user. What the terms don't make obvious is what exactly an authentication factor is, and why one of the most popular authentication schemes---a username and password---is a kind of single-factor authentication. Let's start with the factors. First, there is the knowledge factor: something the user knows, such as a username, password, date of birth, Social Security number, and so on. The second factor is ownership or possession: something the user has in her possession, such as a smart card or token. A third factor is inherence: something the user either is or something they do. An example of an inherence factor is a biometric identifier, such as a fingerprint or retinal pattern. You commonly hear these three factors referred to as something the user knows, something the user has, and something the user is.

Other authentication factors exist but are not as commonly considered in security authentication. For example, there's the location factor: somewhere you are. This can be used if the individual's location can be pinpointed via GPS or some other method. The individual may be required to be at a certain location in order to log in to the system, for example. Yet another is the temporal factor. As the name implies, schemes using the temporal factor may require logon at a certain time of day, or even within so many seconds or minutes of another event. Token methods of authentication also use time factors, as the PIN displayed on a token is only good for a finite amount of time.

Armed with the factors, let's consider authenticating with a single factor. The most common schemes require a username and password; both are something you know, so the scheme uses a single factor. You can also think of a traditional door lock as single-factor authentication; the key it requires is something the user has---a possession factor.

During the initial push to move beyond single-factor authentication, the term two-factor authentication grew common---and you'll still hear people use this term. Over the years, however, authentication methods using more than two factors have grown increasingly common, so it has become more correct to say multifactor authentication. Multifactor authentication (MFA) can use a variety of methods, as long as it uses more than one.

Just because the term sounds fancy and might make us think of complex systems at secret government installations, don't assume multifactor authentication hasn't played a role in everyday life for decades. For example, when you use a bank's ATM, you're using MFA: something you possess (the ATM card) and something you know (the correct PIN).

EXAM TIP   Don't confuse the username and password combination with multifactor authentication. Only one factor is being used here, the knowledge factor, making this a form of single-factor authentication.

Biometric Authentication

Combined with other authentication factors, biometric elements can provide a very secure multifactor authentication mechanism. An example of biometric authentication is presenting a smartcard to a proximity badge reader and then placing your finger on a fingerprint reader to access a secure area.

NOTE   Not every type of biometric authentication is a good fit for mobile devices. You'll get a closer look at the different types and other uses for them in Chapter 27.

Mobile devices use biometrics, too. Laptops have included fingerprint readers for several years already, and they are common in other mobile devices such as smartphones. A prime example is Apple's Touch ID; starting with the iPhone 5s, the iPhone can unlock with a fingerprint. Current iOS devices use facial recognition to identify and authenticate users. Check out Figure 25-13.

Figure 25-13  Face ID options

Authenticator Applications

Access to third-party or corporate networks often requires strong authentication methods. Access to a corporate VPN, for example, may require a specific app, approved and published by the organization, configured with the correct security settings. Generic apps have the ability to use multiple sets of credentials to access different Web sites, networks, or network-based services (for example, corporate e-mail, VPN access, and so forth). There are also apps that can act as tokens or issue temporary session PINs for multifactor authentication. The key to these apps is configuration; settings vary per app, but might include network configuration, authentication or encryption settings, and properly registering a given service with the authenticator app. You'll get a further look at authenticator applications in Chapter 27 as well.

Trusted Sources Versus Untrusted Sources

For the most part, getting software from trusted sources---legitimate app stores run by the major vendors, such as Apple, Google, Microsoft, and Amazon---is both easy and secure. Different vendors have their own requirements (including security) that developers must meet in order to get an app into the vendor's store. Most differences stem from the development and support model used by the vendor.

Apple strictly controls all aspects of the device and the apps available in the App Store (though organizations have some freedom to distribute apps developed in-house to their own devices). For example, Apple has exact requirements for how developers must create an app sold via the App Store. Android, on the other hand, has much less central control. One way Android's relaxed controls manifest is the ability to install apps from untrusted sources.

The operating system flavors developed by different Android device makers can change which sources are and aren't trusted. What may run on devices sold by one vendor isn't necessarily guaranteed to run on another vendor's device, even though they all use variations of the Android operating system. A prime example is Amazon's line of Fire devices (including products like Fire TV and Fire Tablet), which can only get apps from the Amazon Appstore. Additionally, even apps from the Google Play store aren't subject to guidelines as strict as the ones Apple uses. That doesn't mean they are necessarily less secure, but it does make security issues more likely.

The security weakness third-party app stores create is essentially apps from unapproved or unofficial sources. There are definitely legitimate app sources outside of Google Play, such as device manufacturers, communications carriers, and in-house corporate development sources. Some sources are not so legitimate, and are usually unapproved by the vendors, manufacturers, and corporate customers. You may also need to modify your mobile OS to run some apps you obtain through unofficial channels. These third-party apps may be perfectly fine, or they may be malicious and pose a security risk to your device or organization. See "Unauthorized Root Access, Developer Mode, and Sideloading," later in the chapter, for more details.

When getting apps from questionable sources, risks include apps that contain malware or steal personal data and transmit it to a third party. Additionally, some apps require replacing the operating system with one that's not approved by the vendor; this not only invalidates the warranty on most devices, but could cause the device to be unstable and not operate properly.

Firewalls

While we'll discuss them in greater depth in Chapter 27, for now it's enough to know that software firewalls on individual hosts protect them from network-based threats. It isn't completely clear what CompTIA expects you to know about firewalling mobile devices. Generally, mobile devices don't use a firewall, because they don't have lots of services listening on open ports (like a traditional computer would). But, because they aren't listening, you can think of them as having a de facto firewall. The cellular and Wi-Fi networks mobile devices use also employ firewalls to protect all networked devices.

Depending on the OS, you may be able to find and install more traditional software firewall packages. One example of a software firewall for Android is shown in Figure 25-14. Android software firewall packages include basic rule elements for constructing rules to filter specific traffic coming into the host. Many of these packages also include solutions for anti-malware and basic intrusion detection.

Figure 25-14  An Android firewall app

Some of these software firewall solutions are standalone and must be configured and managed by the user, whereas some are enterprise-level solutions and can be centrally configured, updated, and managed by the systems administrator. Keep in mind that software firewall packages work at a very basic level and can't possibly contain every single network threat. Still, they serve as a second line of defense for the host, and are part of any good, layered, defense-in-depth security design.

Mobile OS and Application Security Issues

Security is a complicated, ever-evolving topic. We've already discussed aspects of mobile device security at various points in the chapter, but there are some additional security issues the user and organization need to be aware of and take steps to prevent. We'll begin with a discussion of tools you can use to troubleshoot mobile OS and application security issues broadly, and then turn to some of the common risks, symptoms, and clues related to mobile security issues.

Troubleshooting Tools

While the foundation of good security is staying informed of new threats and being vigilant about the patches, configuration updates, policy changes, anti-malware updates, and user re-education required to address these new threats, this foundation boils down to not giving attackers an easy win. Beyond this, we have to cope with security issues that require constant vigilance: novel threats, avoiding insecure applications, and irresolvable vulnerabilities.

Though your greatest assets are your own curiosity, instincts, and persistence, you can augment these with a variety of technical tools for troubleshooting mobile security issues. Let's look at some of these tools, grouped in terms of the issues they are most useful in addressing: network attacks and app security.

Network Attacks

Device makers originally designed mobile devices to be gregarious by nature---they are more useful this way---but network attacks can exploit such openness. We'll consider specific issues a little later in the "Unintended Connections" section and focus now on tools for identifying and mitigating risks: device security settings, user training, Wi-Fi analyzers, and cell tower analyzers.

Device Security Settings  Because network attacks generally prey on devices that are overeager to connect, the first step to mitigating these threats is to make sure your devices won't automatically connect to any open Wi-Fi network or nearby Bluetooth device. You can apply these settings manually on each device, but you can also use MDM software or similar software made for managing more than one device, such as Apple Configurator.

User Training  It won't help (much) to configure your devices to avoid automatic connections if your users still select any open Wi-Fi network or agree to any pairing request without considering the consequences. Similarly, your network will be at risk if your users don't recognize any of the warning signs that their connection to your organization's secure Wi-Fi network has been intercepted by an evil-twin wireless access point (WAP). Teach them what is normal, and train them to stop and report anything that seems out of place.

Wi-Fi Analyzer  In addition to using a Wi-Fi analyzer for tasks such as figuring out what channel a network should use, optimizing WAP placement, or finding dead spots, you can use one to map out nearby networks (see Figure 25-15). Most of these are probably genuine networks in neighboring buildings or offices, but there's always a chance someone will set up a WAP for the wrong reasons.

Figure 25-15  A Wi-Fi analyzer app on Android showing several SSIDs in the area

Cell Tower Analyzer  Like a Wi-Fi analyzer, a cell tower analyzer helps identify nearby cellular signals, estimate their distance and direction (see Figure 25-16), measure their signal strength, and collect other information such as the technologies they are using, network names, and more. A simple use might be to confirm signal quality for a user having trouble connecting, or to map out access in the building. There's also a chance you'll spot an illegitimate tower operating nearby---and your organization might be the target.

Figure 25-16  My Android-based cell tower analyzer estimating the location of a cell tower

App Security

One of the important things to understand about malware is that the "best" malware accomplishes its objective without anyone detecting it. Almost anyone could figure out that malware is to blame for a device that runs like it's full of molasses and constantly redirects your searches or Web requests to sites that announce that you've won a round-trip to Mars. Because the most dangerous malware is subtle, you need to use tools to help you catch the easy stuff, freeing your attention to see subtle signs something is amiss.

Anti-Malware and App Scanners  Mobile anti-malware apps, much like their desktop counterparts, use signatures and lists to scan a device in order to identify, block, remove, or warn about known malware. An app scanner, by contrast, looks through the permissions requested by your installed apps to assess the risk they pose to security and privacy. You may find some separate apps for performing each of these tasks, or combined apps that can do both. You won't find these apps available for iOS, but many of the same features are available through the Settings app.

App scanners typically run before an app is installed or updated and can give you information such as what network connectivity the app requires, what permissions it needs, and what access the app has to certain hardware and functions on your device. App scanners can also tell you what type of data access the app has to your personal information, such as contacts and media files (see Figure 25-17).

Figure 25-17  Combined anti-malware and app scanner

The usefulness of app scanners as a security tool becomes more apparent if you think of every installed app as posing a few different risks. First, there's the direct risk that the app is designed to spy on you or steal your data. Next, there's the risk that the app maker will lose control of your personal information once it leaves your device. Finally, there's the risk that a vulnerability in the app will allow an attacker to use it against you.

Some users are savvy enough to avoid directly installing malware. But how many of those users know enough to assess the risk that an attacker in the future will be able to exploit a vulnerability in an app they're installing today? And what about malware that doesn't require the user to do anything at all for it to find its way onto their device?

NOTE   Malware is always evolving, and always being developed. Sometimes, the software isn't necessarily intended to be used maliciously. A high-profile example of this was software known as Pegasus. Originally designed to be used by law enforcement agencies to address terrorism and organized crime, it also ended up being used to spy on journalists, activists, and even world leaders. The scariest part was that it didn't require the user to click or install anything in order to get to a mobile device and start spying. This is an example both of how insidious malware can be and how important it is to stay vigilant in securing and monitoring devices.

Remote Backup Applications  Maintaining a current backup of your device is one measure you need to take in case all else fails. Different tools used to perform remote backups and restore data include MDM software, iTunes, and the various synchronization tools for Android; another option is to back up the data to the manufacturer's or third-party user cloud storage, such as Microsoft OneDrive or Apple iCloud.

Some malware can put down deep roots and be hard to expunge. A recent full backup predating the infestation can give you the confidence to focus on making sure you get rid of the malware, rather than focusing on being sure you don't lose important data.

App Troubleshooting Tools  We've already looked at tools for troubleshooting general mobile device and app issues: force stop, uninstalling and reinstalling apps, and a factory reset. You can also use these tools to pinpoint and address app security issues.

Whenever you see clues or symptoms of malware or another app security issue, remember that one way you can isolate the cause is to stop apps until you identify the cause. When you know what is causing the symptoms, uninstall it. If the app is reputable and the symptoms could be non-malicious, reinstall it to see if this fixes the problem. If these steps don't resolve the behavior, use a factory reset to cleanse the device.

Risks, Symptoms, and Clues

The value of your curiosity, intuition, and persistence begins to show in a big way when we look at the risks, symptoms, and clues that malware or some other security problem is present. When you read about a potential risk here, don't assume you'll only see it by itself. Because malware and other attacks can be creative, complex, and multifaceted, view the scenarios discussed in the following sections as risks to understand and manage, symptoms of malware or an attack, or merely clues of an attack underway.

Much like you shouldn't assume you'll see these things as isolated incidents, you shouldn't assume when you encounter one or more of them that malware or an attack is necessarily present. In fact, we've already discussed many of the issues in this section as they relate to other kinds of mobile device problems.

Unexpected Resource Use

If you think about it, malware is just software or a program that uses your device for work or tasks you don't want it to do. Like any program working hard, malware can cause resource issues. Because resource issues can also be relatively benign problems fixed by a soft reset, it's easy to shrug them off. Be suspicious, especially if you see patterns and can't find an obvious explanation; the first clues of an ongoing attempt to spy on your company may well be an uptick in data outbound from affected cellular devices.

Sluggish Response Time  A hot phone, high resource use, and excessive power drain can be common signs that an app is frozen or malfunctioning, but they might also be symptoms that your device is doing precisely what a malware developer intends. The device might be hot, have sluggish response time, or be low on battery because it's a live recording device uploading everything it records in real time, or because it's copying files available on the network to a remote location.

High Network Traffic  Likewise, high network traffic can cause network issues, signal-quality problems, frozen apps, regular syncing of large files---or a sign the device is busy uploading or downloading something without your knowledge. High network traffic may also clue you in to one or more devices that are attempting to use an illegitimate WAP or cell tower that has a lower capacity than its official counterpart.

Data-Usage Limit Notification  As discussed earlier, a data transmission limit is a line in the sand that indicates when a device has used more data than its plan or carrier allots for it. Perhaps the user drove across the country while listening to Spotify, or perhaps the device is uploading stolen data from the device and other networked locations. If you see an inexplicable data-usage limit notification, it may be time to start checking the mobile device for malware.

Unexpected Behaviors

Security threats don't only cause unexpected resource usage, they can also cause unexpected device and application behavior. Much like their desktop counterparts, mobile devices can start to behave strangely when they are infected with malware. A high number of ads, fake security warnings, and unexpected application behavior from individual apps can all be indicators of a security issue, whether it's malware or breached credentials. These issues will be explored in greater detail in Chapter 27, but be aware when you take the CompTIA A+ exams that these issues can also indicate that your mobile device is compromised. As with other computing devices, if you start to see any of these signs, consider scanning for malware as part of your troubleshooting efforts.

Unintended Connections

A major security issue is unintended network connections (such as cellular, Wi-Fi, and Bluetooth). Unintended cellular network connections aren't common since these are preprogrammed into the phone by the carrier and periodically updated, but there is a technique called tower spoofing that involves setting up equipment to spoof a carrier's tower and infrastructure and cause a cellular device to use it instead of the normal tower equipment. It requires overpowering the nearest legitimate cell signal, causing the cellular device to lock onto it instead. Equipment used in tower spoofing can also eavesdrop on any conversation, even if it is encrypted. In some cases, the equipment can fool the device into turning off encryption completely---and sophisticated attacks can even install malware on the device.

Just as hackers have been using this technique for a few years, law enforcement officials have been reportedly using it as well. Since 2010, there have been numerous court cases highlighted in the media questioning the admissibility of evidence obtained from cell signal interception. Media reports say various federal, state, and local law enforcement agencies use a device called a "Stingray" to intercept a suspect's cell traffic using tower spoofing equipment and techniques. There's even an aircraft-mounted version, known as a "Dirtbox."

NOTE   Though much of the news coverage on tower spoofing focuses on U.S. law enforcement agencies using the Stingray, you could just as easily encounter malicious cellular or Wi-Fi networks run (for a variety of reasons) by individuals, businesses, organized crime, and governments anywhere in the world.

Unintended Wi-Fi connections and unintended Bluetooth pairings can enable malicious people to access, steal, or modify data. Configure your mobile device not to connect to unknown Wi-Fi networks or automatically pair with other Bluetooth devices. This will require you to manually connect to known and trusted Wi-Fi networks, and manually pair with Bluetooth devices---but it's worth it. If the device is centrally managed, MDM software can enforce these protections via profile settings.

Connectivity Issues

Earlier, we looked at dropped and weak signals in terms of their impact on battery life, power management, and running apps. Sometimes these signal issues go unnoticed or are only a minor inconvenience. When it comes to cellular signals, they can also be one of the few clues you'll get that your device is interacting with a spoofed cell tower.

If you or your users are in an area where the signal quality should be (and usually is) excellent, be curious---especially if you have multiple reports of difficulty. Check with the relevant cellular providers to see if they have any known tower issues in the area. Fire up a cell tower analyzer and compare nearby signals with what you've seen in the past, or with third-party resources online.

If users are suddenly reporting that Wi-Fi quality is low in an area where it was high, or you notice your device sees a network with a strong signal and the correct SSID in what used to be a dead spot, check it out. There may be a rogue WAP on the loose. Limited or no Internet connectivity can be a tricky problem to troubleshoot. As you've seen both earlier in the book and here in this chapter, there are many potential causes, but if you've ruled out hardware problems and provider issues and are still having limited or no connectivity, it may be time to investigate a security issue as the potential culprit.

Unauthorized Data Access

Securing data stored on a mobile device is hard. The building's security guards might stop a courier from walking out with a desktop under his arm, but they probably won't notice an extra phone in his pocket. Even if they do, he might just confidently claim he has to carry an extra phone for work and go on his way. If I accidentally leave my phone behind at lunch, there's a chance I won't notice until I head to my car that evening. Device locks and remote wipe can usually prevent unauthorized users from accessing data on a mobile device---as long as you wipe the device before it is compromised.

Data can leak out other ways, though, such as removable memory storage cards, and data sharing settings in the device's OS or applications. Removable memory cards should be encrypted if they contain sensitive data, so an unauthorized person can't access data if they are removed from the device. Security and privacy settings on the device can help protect personal data, and the same settings can be configured in different apps that need to access personal data.

One of the more obvious risks to every networked app with access to data is the possibility that it will leak some of that data (whether intentionally or not). In some cases, it can be hard to figure out where the leak is. If an attacker used tax returns you stuck in Dropbox to obtain a loan in your name, where and when did the data go? You had local copies on your phone, laptop, and desktop, plus what was available if your Dropbox credentials were compromised, and any copies that transited over the network. Perhaps the attacker stole them directly from the company that did your taxes.

The point is that leaked files are a risk, a potential symptom of an ongoing security issue, and a possible clue to what that issue might be. A full audit of the many ways an important file could've leaked out of a networked environment is beyond what can be expected of a CompTIA A+ tech, but he or she may well get the first chance to escalate the issue or write it off as a compromised login and make the user change passwords.

EXAM TIP   Portable and mobile devices present amazing opportunities for your personal information to become much less personal and a lot more public. The CompTIA A+ 1102 exam calls this "leaked personal files/data," but it could just as easily be translated as "your phone password wasn't strong and you left the phone in a kiosk at the ski resort." (Not that this has ever happened to me.)

Unauthorized Account Access

Unauthorized account access is a big deal not only for the mobile device itself, but also for all organizational networks it can connect to. If someone steals the account credentials or is able to access a mobile device configured to remember the credentials, then they have an entry point into an organizational network. As discussed earlier, you should plan based on the assumption every device will be lost.

To keep VPN and e-mail connections secure, the device should not store usernames and passwords for connecting automatically. This way, lost or stolen devices can't be used to access these services (at least not without also stealing credentials) because they still require authentication. Unauthorized account access can lead to a malicious person stealing or accessing data not only on the device, but also on the larger network.

When a device is lost, act with an abundance of caution. Treat the previously described precaution as something to protect you until the device is reported missing. Once you know it is missing, change the user's credentials. Keep in mind that compromised account credentials could also be a clue that one of the user's devices itself has been compromised and may be an ongoing threat to the organization.

Unauthorized Root Access, Developer Mode, and Sideloading

To help secure the device, mobile operating systems all restrict the actions (such as installing apps or changing settings) that a user can normally perform. There are ways around these restrictions, though the name of each method differs by OS, depending on how the OS restricts what the user can do. To fully remove these restrictions, a user may have to jailbreak (iOS) or root (Android) the device. Android also has two less intrusive options: developer mode and sideloading. Let's take a look at each.

EXAM TIP   Know jailbreak, root access, and the OS associated with each, but keep in mind that it's common to see both of these terms used in relation to removing access restrictions from any given device.

Jailbreaking means the user installs a program on the iOS device that changes settings Apple didn't intend for users to change. Jailbreaking allows a user to install blocked software, such as apps that don't come from the App Store or apps that don't meet Apple's legal and quality requirements. Jailbreaking also enables a user to unlock functionality on the device.

Rooting an Android device is a similar procedure to grant the user full administrative access to the lower-level functionality of the device. As in the case of jailbreaking, this is also done to install software or enable functions that could not otherwise be used on the device. Although none of the popular Android device vendors condone rooting, they have little recourse beyond voiding the warranty if the user owns the device.

Developer mode is another Android-specific mode, but unlike rooting, it doesn't present the same level of catastrophic risk that rooting can. You don't void your warranty, you don't leave your phone unusable if you make a mistake, and you don't introduce major security risks. However, a user who isn't familiar with developer mode options may end up changing settings that make using the device more difficult. Developer mode gives users access to features like USB debugging, more advanced resource monitoring, and the ability to go a step farther by rooting the device. As a result, developer mode doesn't present its own security risks, but it does give Android users access to functionality that might.

In the same vein, another unique aspect of Android when compared to Apple's mobile OSs is the ability to sideload applications without using a dedicated app store. Sideloading allows an Android user to use a file called an Android package (APK) to install an app that they got from a Web site or source other than the Google Play store onto their device. Sideloading can have some advantages like allowing a user to bypass geographic limitations or install software that was previously available on the app store and removed for whatever reason.

Sideloading also comes with security risks. Some APKs can be bootleg applications, which can pose legal issues. Other APKs may be malicious applications, designed to act similarly to a Trojan horse (explained in more detail in Chapter 27). Application spoofing can be a very dangerous attack method when used against mobile devices, as many people wrongly assume that mobile devices aren't vulnerable the same way desktop and laptop computers are. As with any other class of devices, a false sense of security can lead to real-world security problems.

The important thing to keep in mind with jailbreaking, rooting, and sideloading is that they give the user more power at the expense of disabling protections that limit the damage malicious apps can do to the device. There are some things you just can't use a device for without removing these restrictions, but the benefit should always be weighed against the risk, especially when it comes to deciding whether to allow jailbroken/rooted devices on your network.

NOTE   Organizational networks may use MDM software to detect and block devices that have used one of these methods to remove restrictions.

The manufacturer or service provider may prevent a device from connecting to their services if they detect the change. There are also immediate risks: a failed attempt could brick the device, or perhaps just render it unusable until you restore it completely from a backup (removing the jailbreaking/rooting software in the process).

Unauthorized Location Tracking

We discussed the benefits of GPS and location tracking earlier, but there are also risks involved. Configuration settings in the OS and apps may allow a user's location to be sent to third parties, sometimes without explicit consent or knowledge. The best way to prevent this is to turn off the GPS function or location services unless they are needed. Another way is to configure the device and apps that use geotracking to prevent unauthorized tracking, if the device allows it. Some apps---or specific features---simply won't work until geotracking is enabled (see Figure 25-18).

Figure 25-18  Four Android apps prompting the user to enable location services

Keep in mind that the GPS functionality in a mobile device is not the only way to track its location; cellular networks and Wi-Fi are also used to track device location, although not as precisely as GPS. Some of the network attacks in the "Unintended Connections" section can also be used to locate or track a device.

Unauthorized Camera and Microphone Activation

App features, malware, and unauthorized network connections can potentially be used to activate (or disable!) some features on a mobile device. Any built-in cameras and microphones are of particular concern, because they enable an attacker to move beyond sensitive data on the device and effectively spy on anyone near it.

NOTE   Some of the most sophisticated attacks using methods discussed in the earlier "Unintended Connections" section can reportedly cause a device to appear to power down while still leaving its microphone active. Attacks of this quality may be unavoidable until carriers and device makers secure their networks and devices against them, but you can still be on the lookout for strange behavior.

The ways to prevent these exploits are by restricting camera and microphone permissions in apps or operating systems (when they allow it), taking steps previously described to prevent unauthorized network connections, and using anti-malware solutions on the device. Even when you're looking at a popular app by a trustworthy developer, such as the iOS apps with camera permissions in Figure 25-19, keep in mind that any vulnerabilities in a networked app with camera and microphone permissions could allow an attacker to listen in.

CHAPTER 26

Printers and Multifunction Devices

In this chapter, you will learn how to

-   Describe current printer and multifunction device consumables

-   Explain the laser printing process

-   Install and configure a printer or multifunction device consumable

-   Recognize and fix basic printer and multifunction device problems

Despite all the talk about the "paperless office," paper documents continue to be a vital part of the typical office. Some computers are used exclusively for the purpose of producing paper documents. Many people simply still prefer dealing with a hard copy, even as portable devices have proliferated. Developers cater to this preference by using metaphors such as page, workbook, and binder in their applications.

In the past, your average office had an array of electronic and mechanical devices dedicated to performing a single task with paper documents. Think printers, copiers, scanners, and fax machines. Back in the 1990s, the multifunction device (MFD), also known as a multifunction printer (MFP), tried to consolidate multiple functions (often printing and scanning) into a single device. At first these devices weren't terribly great at any of their functions, but today's mature multifunction devices get their many jobs done well.

The CompTIA A+ certification strongly stresses the area of printing and expects a high degree of technical knowledge of the function, components, maintenance, and repair of all types of printers and multifunction devices.

This chapter examines the common varieties of printers and scanners, then looks at specifics of how a laser printer works. The chapter continues with the steps for installing a multifunction device in a typical personal computer and concludes with troubleshooting issues.

1101

Printer and Multifunction Device Consumables

The multifunction devices commonly used in SOHO environments typically sit on a desk, shelf, or countertop, and they tend to be fairly similar in appearance. Because of this, when most of us think about MFDs, we picture small desktop all-in-one devices (which can usually be used as a printer, scanner, copier, and fax machine) connected to a nearby computer (see Figure 26-1 for an example).

Figure 26-1  All-in-one printer/scanner/fax machine/copier/iPhone dock

The reality is that these desktop devices, descendants of the desktop printer and scanner, are just the low end of the market. As you head upmarket, multifunction printers look more like the descendants of copy machines and even small printing presses. Despite how different from SOHO MFDs these high-end devices may look, they still share a core set of components---a printer and scanner of some sort---with the all-in-ones you're probably familiar with. As you go upmarket, the greatest improvements tend to be in speed/capacity, durability, and document handling/finishing features such as sorting, stapling, binding, and so on.

Because MFDs are so varied, we'll look at some of the individual components and technologies you may find inside them separately---be prepared to encounter these components as both standalone devices and included with other components in an MFD. I've added 3-D printers to this section; you won't find these as anything but standalone devices, not MFDs.

Printers

No other piece of your computer system is available in a wider range of styles, configurations, and feature sets than a printer, or at such a wide price variation. What a printer can and can't do is largely determined by the type of printer technology it uses---that is, how it gets the image onto the paper. Modern printers can be categorized into several types: impact, inkjet, thermal, laser, 3-D, and virtual.

Impact Printers

Printers that create an image on paper by physically striking an ink ribbon against the paper's surface are known as impact printers. Although daisy-wheel printers (essentially an electric typewriter attached to the computer instead of directly to a keyboard) have largely disappeared, their cousins, dot-matrix printers, still soldier on in many offices. Although dot-matrix printers don't deliver what most home users want---high quality and flexibility at a low cost---they're still widely found in businesses for two reasons: dot-matrix printers have a large installed base in businesses, and they can be used for multipart forms because they actually strike the paper. Impact printers tend to be relatively slow and noisy, but when speed, flexibility, and print quality are not critical, they provide acceptable results. Computers that print multipart forms, such as point of sale (POS) machines, use special impact paper that can print receipts in duplicate, triplicate, or more. These POS machines represent the major market for new impact printers, although some older dot-matrix printers remain in use.

Dot-matrix printers use a grid, or matrix, of tiny pins, also known as printwires, to strike an inked printer ribbon and produce images on paper (see Figure 26-2). The case that holds the printwires is called a printhead. Using either 9 or 24 pins, dot-matrix printers treat each page as a picture broken up into a dot-based raster image. The 9-pin dot-matrix printers are generically called draft quality, while the 24-pin printers are known as letter quality or near-letter quality (NLQ). The BIOS for the printer (either built into the printer or a printer driver) interprets the raster image in the same way a monitor does, "painting" the image as individual dots. Naturally, the more pins, the higher the resolution. Figure 26-3 illustrates the components common to dot-matrix printers. Some dot-matrix printers use continuous-feed paper with holes on its sides that are engaged by metal sprockets to pull the paper through---this is known as tractor-feed paper because the sprockets are reminiscent of the wheels on a tractor.

Figure 26-3  Inside a dot-matrix printer

Inkjet Printers

Inkjet printers (also called ink-dispersion printers) like the one shown in Figure 26-4 are relatively simple devices. An inkjet printer uses a printhead connected to a carriage that contains the ink. A carriage belt and motor move the carriage back and forth so the ink can cover the whole page. A roller grabs paper from a paper tray (usually under or inside the printer) or feeder (usually on the back of the printer) and advances it through the printer (see Figure 26-5).

Figure 26-4  Typical inkjet printer

Figure 26-5  Inside an inkjet printer

The ink is ejected through tiny tubes. Most inkjet printers use heat to move the ink, while a few use a mechanical method. The heat-method printers use tiny resistors or electroconductive plates at the end of each tube that literally boil the ink; this creates a tiny air bubble that ejects a droplet of ink onto the paper, thus creating a portion of the image (see Figure 26-6).

Figure 26-6  Detail of the inkjet printhead

The ink is stored in special small containers called ink cartridges. Older inkjet printers had two cartridges: one for black ink and another for colored ink. The color cartridge had separate compartments for cyan (blue), magenta (red), and yellow ink, to print colors by using a method known as CMYK (you'll read more about CMYK later in this chapter). If your color cartridge ran out of one of the colors, you had to purchase a whole new color cartridge or deal with a messy refill kit.

Printer manufacturers began to separate the ink colors into three separate cartridges so that printers came with four cartridges: one for each color and a fourth for black (see Figure 26-7). This not only was more cost-effective for the user, but it also resulted in higher-quality printouts. Today you can find color inkjet printers with six, eight, or more color cartridges. In addition to the basic CMYK inks, the additional cartridges provide for green, blue, gray, light cyan, dark cyan, and more. Typically, printers using more ink cartridges produce higher-quality printed images---and cost more.

Figure 26-7  Inkjet ink cartridges

In recent years, manufacturers such as Epson and Canon have introduced ink-jet printers with refillable ink tanks, radically changing the economics of printing. Rather than selling printers inexpensively and raking in money on throw-away ink cartridges, consumers and businesses can print in glorious color without the hassle (or guilt). The printers, such as the Epson EcoTank line, cost a lot more than previous models (think $300--$700 rather than $60--$120), but come with a couple of years' worth of ink fresh out of the box. Let the color flow.

The two key features of an inkjet printer are the print resolution---how densely the printer lays down ink on the page---and the print speed. Resolution is measured in horizontal and vertical dots per inch (dpi), such as 2400 × 2400 dpi. Higher numbers mean that the ink dots on the page are closer together, so your printed documents will look better. Resolution is most important when you're printing complex images such as full-color photos, or when you're printing for duplication and you care that your printouts look good. Print speed is measured in pages per minute (ppm), and this specification is normally indicated right on the printer's box. Most printers have one (faster) speed for monochrome printing---that is, using only black ink---and another for full-color printing.

Another feature of inkjet printers is that they can support a staggering array of print media. Using an inkjet printer, you can print on a variety of matte or glossy photo papers, iron-on transfers, and other specialty media; some printers can print directly onto specially coated optical discs, or even fabric. Imagine running a T-shirt through your printer with your own custom slogan (how about "I'm CompTIA A+ Certified!"). The inks have improved over the years, too, now delivering better quality and longevity than ever. Where older inks would smudge if the paper got wet or start to fade after a short time, modern inks are smudge-proof and of archival quality---for example, some inks by Epson are projected to last up to 200 years.

For best results with all this variety of media available, you need to make sure the print settings match the paper/media type. In Windows 10, for example, go to Settings | Devices | Printers & scanners. Select the printer installed, click Manage, and go to Printer preferences. There you can change the media type to match.

NOTE   Print resolution is measured in dots per inch (dpi) and print speed is measured in pages per minute (ppm).

Try This!

Pages per Minute Versus Price

Printer speed is a key determinant of a printer's price, and this is an easy assertion to prove, so try this!

1\.   Open a browser and head over to the Web site for HP (https://www.hp.com), Canon (https://www.canon.com), Epson (https://www.epson.com), Brother (https://www.brother.com), or Samsung (https://www.samsung.com). These five companies make most of the printers on the market today.

2\.   Pick a printer technology and check the price, from the cheapest to the most expensive. Then look for printers that have the same resolution but different ppm rates.

3\.   Check the prices and see how the ppm rate affects the price of two otherwise identical printers.

Thermal Printers

Thermal printers use a heated printhead to create a high-quality image on special or plain paper. You'll see two kinds of thermal printers in use. The first is the direct thermal printer, and the other is the thermal wax transfer printer. Direct thermal printers use a heating element to burn dots into the surface of special heat-sensitive thermal paper. If you remember the first generation of fax machines, you're already familiar with this type of printer. Many retail businesses still use it as a receipt printer, using large rolls of thermal paper housed in a feed assembly that automatically draws the paper past the heating element; some receipt printers can even cut the paper off the roll for you.

Laser Printers

Using a process called electro-photographic imaging, laser printers produce high-quality and high-speed output of both text and graphics. Figure 26-8 shows a typical laser printer. Laser printers rely on the photoconductive properties of certain organic compounds. Photoconductive means that particles of these compounds, when exposed to light (that's the "photo" part), will conduct electricity. Laser printers usually use lasers as a light source because of their precision. Some lower-cost printers use LED arrays instead.

Figure 26-8  Typical laser printer

The first laser printers created only monochrome images; you can also buy a color laser printer, but most laser printers produced today are still monochrome. Although a color laser printer can produce complex full-color images such as photographs, they really shine for printing what's known as spot color---for example, eye-catching headings, lines, charts, or other graphical elements that dress up an otherwise plain printed presentation.

NOTE   Some printers use consumables---such as ink---at a faster rate than others, prompting the industry to rank printers in terms of their cost per page. Using an inexpensive printer (laser or inkjet) costs around 4 cents per page, while an expensive printer can cost more than 20 cents per page---a huge difference if you do any volume printing. This hidden cost is particularly pernicious in the sub-$100 inkjet printers on the market. Their low prices often entice buyers, who then discover that the cost of consumables is outrageous---these days, a single set of color and black inkjet cartridges can cost as much as the printer itself, if not more!

The CompTIA A+ certification exams take a keen interest in the particulars of the laser printing process---or specifically, the imaging process---so it pays to know your way around a laser printer (see Figure 26-9). Let's take a look at the many components of laser printers and their functions. The imaging process is described in detail later in the chapter in the section "The Laser Printing Process."

Figure 26-9  Components inside a laser printer

Toner Cartridge  The toner cartridge in a laser printer is so named because of its most obvious activity: supplying the toner that creates the image on the page (see Figure 26-10). To reduce maintenance costs, however, many other laser printer parts, especially those that suffer the most wear and tear, have been incorporated into the toner cartridge. Although this makes replacement of individual parts nearly impossible, it greatly reduces the need for replacement; those parts that are most likely to break are replaced every time you replace the toner cartridge.

Figure 26-10  Laser printer's toner cartridge

NOTE   Color laser printers have four toner cartridges: black, cyan, magenta, and yellow.

Imaging Drum  The imaging drum (also called the photosensitive drum) is an aluminum cylinder coated with particles of photosensitive compounds. The drum itself is grounded to the power supply, but the coating is not. When light hits these particles, whatever electrical charge they may have "drains" out through the grounded cylinder.

Erase Lamp  The erase lamp exposes the entire surface of the imaging drum to light, making the photosensitive coating conductive. Any electrical charge present in the particles bleeds away into the grounded drum, leaving the surface particles electrically neutral.

Primary Corona/Charge Roller  The primary corona wire (or primary charge roller, in newer laser printers), located close to the imaging drum, never touches the drum. When the primary corona or primary charge roller is charged with an extremely high voltage, an electric field (or corona) forms, enabling voltage to pass to the drum and charge the photosensitive particles on its surface. The primary grid regulates the transfer of voltage, ensuring that the surface of the drum receives a uniform negative voltage of between ~600 and ~1000 volts.

Laser  The laser acts as the writing mechanism of the printer. Any particle on the drum struck by the laser becomes conductive and its charge is drained away into the grounded core of the drum. The entire surface of the drum has a uniform negative charge of between ~600 and ~1000 volts following its charging by the primary corona wire or charge roller. When particles are struck by the laser, they are discharged and left with a ~100-volt negative charge. Using the laser, we can "write" an image onto the drum. Note that the laser writes a positive image to the drum.

Toner  The toner in a laser printer is a fine powder made up of plastic particles bonded to pigment particles. The toner cylinder charges the toner with a negative charge of between ~200 and ~500 volts. Because that charge falls between the original uniform negative charge of the imaging drum (~600 to ~1000 volts) and the charge of the particles on the drum's surface hit by the laser (~100 volts), particles of toner are attracted to the areas of the imaging drum that have been hit by the laser (that is, areas that have a relatively positive charge with reference to the toner particles).

EXAM TIP   The black toner used in laser printers is typically carbon mixed into polyester resin, while color toner trades carbon for other pigments.

Transfer Corona/Transfer Roller  To transfer the image from the imaging drum to the paper, the paper must be given a charge that will attract the toner particles off of the drum and onto the paper. In older printers, the transfer corona, a thin wire, applied a positive charge to the paper, drawing the negatively charged toner particles to the paper. Newer printers accomplish the same feat using a transfer roller that draws the toner onto the paper. The paper, with its positive charge, is also attracted to the negatively charged drum. To prevent the paper from wrapping around the drum, a static charge eliminator removes the charge from the paper.

In most laser printers, the transfer corona/roller is outside the toner cartridge, especially in large, commercial-grade machines. The transfer corona/roller is prone to a build-up of dirt, toner, and debris through electrostatic attraction, and it must be cleaned. It is also quite fragile---usually finer than a human hair. Most printers with an exposed transfer corona/roller provide a special tool to clean it, but you can also---very delicately---use a cotton swab soaked in denatured alcohol (don't use rubbing alcohol because it contains emollients). As always, never service any printer without first turning it off and unplugging it from its power source.

Fuser Assembly  The fuser assembly is almost always separate from the toner cartridge. It is usually quite easy to locate, as it is close to the bottom of the toner cartridge and usually has two rollers to fuse the toner. Sometimes the fuser is somewhat enclosed and difficult to recognize because the rollers are hidden from view. To help you determine the location of the fuser, think about the path of the paper and the fact that fusing is the final step of printing.

The toner is merely resting on top of the paper after the static charge eliminator has removed the paper's static charge. The toner must be melted to the paper to make the image permanent. Two rollers, a pressure roller and a heated roller, are used to fuse the toner to the paper. The pressure roller presses against the bottom of the page, and the heated roller presses down on the top of the page, melting the toner into the paper. The heated roller has a nonstick coating such as Teflon to prevent the toner from sticking to it.

Power Supplies  All of the devices described in this chapter have power supplies, but when dealing with laser printers, techs should take extra caution. The corona in a laser printer requires extremely high voltage from the power supply, making a laser printer power supply one of the most dangerous devices in computing! Turn off and unplug the printer as a safety precaution before performing any maintenance.

Turning Gears  A laser printer has many mechanical functions. First, the paper must be grabbed by the pickup roller and passed over the separation pad, which is a small piece of cork or rubber that separates the sheets as they are pulled from the paper feed tray. A separation pad uses friction to separate a single sheet from any others that were picked up. Next, the photosensitive roller must be turned and the laser, or a mirror, must be moved back and forth. The toner must be evenly distributed, and the fuser assembly must squish the toner into the paper. Finally, the paper must be kicked out of the printer and the assembly must be cleaned to prepare for the next page.

EXAM TIP   Be sure you are familiar with laser printer components, particularly the imaging drum, fuser assembly, transfer belt, transfer roller, pickup rollers, separation pads, and duplexing assembly.

More sophisticated laser printers enable duplex printing, meaning they can print on both sides of the paper. This is another mechanical function with a dedicated duplexing assembly for reversing the paper.

All of these functions are served by complex gear systems. In most laser printers, these gear systems are packed together in discrete units generically called gear packs or gearboxes. Most laser printers have two or three gearboxes that you can remove relatively easily in the rare case one of them fails. Most gearboxes also have their own motor or solenoid to move the gears.

All of these mechanical features can wear out or break and require service or replacement. See the "Troubleshooting Printers" section, later in this chapter, for more details.

System Board  Every laser printer contains at least one electronic board. On this board is the main processor, the printer's ROM, and the RAM used to store the image before it is printed. Many printers divide these functions among two or three boards dispersed around the printer (also known as sub-logic boards, as shown back in Figure 26-10). An older printer may also have an extra ROM chip and/or a special slot where you can install an extra ROM chip, usually for special functions such as PostScript.

On some printer models, you can upgrade the contents of these ROM chips (the firmware) by performing a process called flashing the ROM. Flashing is a lot like upgrading the system BIOS, which you learned about in Chapter 5. Upgrading the firmware can help fix bugs, add new features, or update the fonts in the printer.

Of particular importance is the printer's RAM. When the printer doesn't have enough RAM to store the image before it prints, you get a memory overflow problem. Also, some printers store other information in the RAM, including fonts or special commands. Adding RAM is usually a simple job---just snapping in a SIMM or DIMM stick or two---but getting the right RAM is important. Call or check the printer manufacturer's Web site to see what type of RAM you need. Although most printer companies will happily sell you their expensive RAM, most printers can use generic DRAM like the kind you use in a computer.

Ozone Filter  The coronas inside laser printers generate ozone (O3). Although not harmful to humans in small amounts, even tiny concentrations of ozone will cause damage to printer components. To counter this problem, most laser printers have a special ozone filter that needs to be vacuumed or replaced periodically.

Sensors and Switches  Every laser printer has a large number of sensors and switches spread throughout the machine. The sensors are used to detect a broad range of conditions such as paper jams, empty paper trays, or low toner levels. Many of these sensors are really tiny switches that detect open doors and so on. Most of the time these sensors/switches work reliably, yet occasionally they become dirty or broken, sending a false signal to the printer. Simple inspection is usually sufficient to determine if a problem is real or just the result of a faulty sensor/switch.

3-D Printers

3-D printers (see Figure 26-11) use melted material to create prints of three-dimensional objects. The flat surface from which the 3-D printer deposits this melted material to build an object is called the print bed. The most common 3-D printers use plastic filament or resin on spools (see Figure 26-12). Some 3-D printers enable you to print with multiple colors.

Figure 26-11  3-D printer

Figure 26-12  3-D printer plastic filament

A typical 3-D printer is made of many distinct parts. Take a look at Figure 26-13 for a breakdown of some of the more important components.

Figure 26-13  3-D printer

3-D printers take a 3-D illustration and build it in tiny layers or slices, one by one. 3-D filament printers work by melting the plastic and allowing it to cool as the 3-D image builds. 3-D resin printers work by placing liquid resin down and curing it with UV light. Simple printers can create relatively simple shapes, such as blocks, pyramids, and so on. Better printers can create more exciting shapes, such as the stylized replacement game pieces for the popular board game Settlers of Catan pictured in Figure 26-14. Even better 3-D printers can make elaborate structures, with lots of holes and gaps within the layers.

Figure 26-14  3-D-printed game pieces (photo courtesy of Donny Jansen)

Installation of 3-D printers requires more than the typical printer installation. The connections (USB) and drivers are typical, but 3-D printers also need manual connection of the plastic filament(s) to the print device. You'll also need specialized software designed to print in 3-D. Most manufacturers' 3-D printing software enables you to use standard 3-D drawings, such as STL, OBJ, and CAD files. Figure 26-15 shows the Ultimaker Cura software pushing a print job to a 3-D printer. Sweet!

Virtual Printers

The most quizzical printer of all, the virtual printer, doesn't look like much, but it's actually still pretty similar to physical or "real" printing. When you print to a virtual printer, your system goes through all the steps to prepare a document for printing and sends it off to a virtual printer---a program that converts the output from your computer into a specific format and saves the result to a portable file that looks like the printed page would have. You can print this file later if you like, or maybe send it to someone else to print, but you can also just keep it in digital format. Virtual printers provide a nice way to save anything you can print, and they're particularly good for saving reference copies of information found on the Web.

Print to PDF  One of the most popular virtual printing options is the ability to print to PDF, a feature every operating system supports out of the box these days. Windows didn't join the party until Windows 10, however, so be aware that you'll need to install a virtual PDF printer on older versions of Windows. You can get these through official Adobe software, but there are also some third-party options.

Cloud and Remote Printing  Blurring the line between traditional and virtual printing, a variety of cloud services, such as Google Cloud Print, will install a virtual printer on your system that wraps up your document and sends it out over the Internet or other network to a cloud server, which eventually ends up routing it to a real printer for printing---all without needing to have a driver installed for it.

Printer Languages

Now that you've learned about the different types of print devices and techniques, it's time to take a look at how they communicate with the computer. How do you tell a printer to make a letter A or to print a picture of your pet iguana? Printers are designed to accept predefined printer languages that handle both characters and graphics. Your software must use the proper language when communicating with your printer, in order to output paper documents. Following are the more common printer languages.

EXAM TIP   One thing to remember for the exam is the importance of choosing the appropriate driver for the OS. A common printing mistake, for example, is that you may be printing to a PostScript printer with a PCL driver.

NOTE   You might think of the American Standard Code for Information Interchange (ASCII) language as nothing more than a standard set of characters. ASCII actually contains a variety of control codes for transferring data, some of which can be used to control printers. For example, ASCII code 10 (or 0A in hex) means "Line Feed," and ASCII code 12 (0C) means "Form Feed." These commands have been standard since before the creation of IBM computers, and all printers respond to them. If they did not, the PRT SCR (print screen) key would not work with every printer. Being highly standardized has advantages, but the control codes are extremely limited. Printing high-end graphics and a wide variety of fonts requires more advanced languages.

PostScript  Adobe Systems developed the PostScript page description language in the early 1980s as a device-independent printer language capable of high-resolution graphics and scalable fonts. PostScript interpreters are embedded in the printing device. Because PostScript is understood by printers at a hardware level, the majority of the image processing is done by the printer and not the computer's CPU, so PostScript printers print faster. PostScript defines the page as a single raster image; this makes PostScript files extremely portable---they can be created on one machine or platform and reliably printed out on another machine or platform (including, for example, high-end typesetters).

HP Printer Command Language  HP developed its Printer Command Language (PCL) as a more advanced printer language to supersede simple ASCII codes. PCL features a set of printer commands greatly expanded from ASCII. HP designed PCL with text-based output in mind; it does not support advanced graphical functions. The most recent version of PCL, PCL6, features scalable fonts and additional line-drawing commands. Unlike PostScript, however, PCL is not a true page description language; it uses a series of commands to define the characters on the page. Those commands must be supported by each individual printer model, making PCL files less portable than PostScript files.

EXAM TIP   The CompTIA A+ Acronym list identifies PCL as Printer Control Language. Control or Command is rather irrelevant at this point in time. HP refers to PCL as simply PCL in all its documentation.

Windows GDI and XPS  Windows uses the graphical device interface (GDI) component of the operating system to handle print functions. Although you can use an external printer language such as PostScript, most users simply install printer drivers and let Windows do all the work. The GDI uses the CPU rather than the printer to process a print job and then sends the completed job to the printer. When you print a letter with a TrueType font in Windows, for example, the GDI processes the print job and then sends bitmapped images of each page to the printer. The printer sees a page of TrueType text, therefore, as a picture, not as text. As long as the printer has a capable enough raster image processor (explained later in this chapter) and plenty of RAM, you don't need to worry about the printer language in most situations. We'll revisit printing in Windows in more detail later in this chapter.

Windows Vista also introduced a new printing subsystem called the XML Paper Specification (XPS) print path in 2006. In 2009, the ECMA-388 standard formally named XPS the Open XML Paper Specification (OpenXPS), although Microsoft and others continue to use only XPS in documentation and screen elements. XPS provides several improvements over GDI, including enhanced color management (which works with Windows Color System, introduced in the "Optimizing Print Performance" section later in the chapter) and better print layout fidelity. The XPS print path requires a driver that supports XPS. Additionally, some printers natively support XPS, eliminating the requirement that the output be converted to a device-specific printer control language before printing.

EXAM TIP   Laser and inkjet printers can also use duplexing assemblies, which enable the printer to automatically print on both sides of the paper. Some printers include this built-in feature, while others require a piece of additional hardware that flips the paper for the printer.

Scanners

You can use a scanner to make digital copies of existing paper photos, documents, drawings, and more. Better scanners give you the option of copying directly from a photographic negative or slide, providing images of stunning visual quality---assuming the original photo was halfway decent, of course! In this section, you'll look at how scanners work and then turn to what you need to know to select the correct scanner for you or your clients.

How Scanners Work

All flatbed scanners, the most common variety of scanner, work the same way. You place a photo or other object face down on the glass (called the platen), close the lid, and then use software to initiate the scan. The scanner runs a bright light along the length of the platen once or more to capture the image. Figure 26-16 shows an open scanner.

Figure 26-16  Scanner open with photograph face down

NOTE   Many serious flatbed scanners and multifunction devices will have an automatic document feeder (ADF) to remove most of the manual labor from this process. Check out the upcoming "Automatic Document Feeder" section for more details.

The scanning software that controls the hardware can manifest in a variety of ways. Nearly every manufacturer has some combination of drivers and other software to create an interface between your computer and the scanner. When you push the front button on the Epson Perfection scanner, for example, the Epson software loads, ready to start scanning (see Figure 26-17).

Figure 26-17  Epson software

You can also open your favorite image-editing software first and choose to acquire a file from a scanner. Figure 26-18 shows the process of acquiring an image from a scanner in the popular free image-editing software, GNU Image Manipulation Program (otherwise known as GIMP). As in most such software, you choose File | Create and then select Scanner. In this case, the scanner uses the traditional TWAIN drivers. TWAIN stands for Technology Without an Interesting Name---I'm not making this up!---and has been the default driver type for scanners for a long time.

Figure 26-18  Acquiring an image in GNU Image Manipulation Program (GIMP)

At this point, the drivers and other software controlling the scanner pop up, providing an interface with the scanner (as shown in Figure 26-17). Here you can set the resolution of the image as well as many other options.

NOTE   In addition to loading pictures into your computer, many scanners offer a feature called optical character recognition (OCR), a way to scan a document and have the computer turn the picture into text that you can manipulate by using a word processing program.

How to Choose a Scanner

You must consider four primary variables when choosing a scanner: resolution, color depth, grayscale depth, and scan speed. You can and will adjust the first three during the scanning process, although probably only down from their maximum. The scan speed relates to all four of the other variables, and the maximum speed is hard-coded into the scanner.

Configurable Variables  Scanners convert the scanned image into a grid of pixels (often referred to as dots). The maximum number of pixels determines how well you can capture an image and how the image will look when scaled up in size. Most folks use the term resolution to define the grid size. As you might imagine, the higher-resolution images capture more fine detail.

Older scanners can create images of only 600 × 600 dots per inch (dpi), while newer models commonly achieve four times that density, and high-end machines do much more. Manufacturers cite two sets of numbers for a scanner's resolution: the resolution it achieves mechanically---called the optical resolution---and the enhanced resolution it can achieve with assistance from some onboard software.

The enhanced resolution numbers are useless. I recommend at least 2400 × 2400 dpi optical resolution or better, although you can get by with a lower resolution for purely Web-destined images.

The color depth of a scan defines the number of bits of information the scanner can use to describe each individual pixel. This number determines color, shade, hue, and so forth, so color depth makes a dramatic difference in how easily you can adjust the color and tone in your photo editor. With binary numbers, each extra bit of information doubles the color detail in the scan. The most common color depth options you will run across in scanners today are 24-bit and 48-bit. A 24-bit scan, for example, can save up to 256 shades for each of the red, green, and blue sub-pixels that make up an individual pixel. This gives you a total of 16,777,216 color variations in the scanned image, which explains why some scanners refer to this as "millions of colors" in their settings. A 48-bit scan, in contrast, can save up to 65,536 shades per subpixel, giving you a scan that holds a massive 281,474,976,710,656 color variations. All this extra color does come with a downside: images scanned at 48 bits are twice the size of 24-bit scans and can easily be hundreds of megabytes per file!

These days, 48-bit scanners are common enough that you shouldn't have to settle for less, even on a budget. Figures 26-19, 26-20, and 26-21 show pretty clearly the difference resolution makes when scanning.

Figure 26-19  Earring scanned at 72 dpi and 24-bit color

Figure 26-20  Same earring, scanned at 300 dpi and 24-bit color

Figure 26-21  Same earring, scanned at 1200 dpi and 24-bit color

Scanners differ a lot in grayscale depth, a number that defines how many shades of gray the scanner can save per pixel. This matters if you work with black-and-white images in any significant way, because grayscale depth may be advertised with a much lower number than color depth. Current consumer-level scanners come in 8-bit, 12-bit, and 16-bit grayscale varieties. You might recognize these three numbers from the previous color depth discussion, because grayscale images only need a third the information it takes to represent the red, green, and blue values that make up a color image. I recommend 16-bit.

Scanning Speed  Scanners have a maximum scanning speed defined by the manufacturer. The time required to complete a scan is also affected by the parameters you set; the time increases as you increase the amount of detail captured. A typical low-end scanner, for example, takes upward of 30 seconds to scan a 4 × 6 photo at 300 dpi. A faster scanner, in contrast, can crank out the same scan in 10 seconds.

Raise the resolution of the scan to 600 dpi at 48-bit resolution, and that faster scanner can take a full minute to complete the scan. Adjust your scanning settings to optimize for your project. Don't always go for the highest quality scan if you don't need the resolution and color depth.

Network Scan Services

If you've ever had to fill out a paper document and upload it, you've used a scanner, but you may not be aware of how many ways networking can make scanning easier. You can use cloud services like we talked about for printers earlier in the chapter, but that's not all. Remember the SMB protocol from Chapter 19? It's not just for print sharing.

You can also use SMB for scan sharing, enabling the scanning of a lot of data directly to a networked folder that other people on the network can access. It can save a few steps by removing the need to scan locally and then manually move the scanned files to the file share; but be careful, using SMB can introduce security vulnerabilities (you'll learn all about security and vulnerabilities in the next chapter). Many multifunction devices are older, and as a result, may only support older versions of the protocol. If the device only supports SMB 1.0, then you'll probably want to find an alternative way to get your scanned documents onto a network share.

Scanning can even make use of the humble email. Many multifunction devices include a scan to e-mail feature, which lets you scan a document and have it automatically e-mailed from you to someone else. This is useful when you want to send a scanned document to an individual or small group rather than to a dedicated network share.

Scanning Tips

As a general rule, you should obtain the highest quality scan you can manage, and then play with the size and image quality when it's time to print it or share it over the Web. The amount of RAM in your system---and to a lesser extent, the processor speed---dictates how big a file you can handle.

NOTE   If you're set to do some heavy scanning---like archiving all those old family photos---check out Wayne Fulton's Web site, https://www.scantips.com. The site has a simple, direct interface, and a treasure trove of excellent information on scanners and scanning. I've used his knowledge for years now and recommend it highly.

If you travel a lot, you'll want to make sure to use the locking mechanism for the scanner light assembly. Just be sure to unlock before you try to use it or you'll get a light that's stuck in one position. That won't make for very good scans!

Copy and Fax Components

The scanning and printing capabilities of a multifunction device enable manufacturers to add copy-machine features easily. To copy a document or photo, you essentially scan a document or photo and then print it, but all with a single press of the Copy button.

Faxing generally requires separate functions in the machine, such as a document feed and a connection to a traditional, analog phone line. Assuming you have those and an account with the local telecom company, the process of faxing is pretty simple. You put a document in the feeder, plug in the fax number, and press the Send button (or whatever the manufacturer labels it).

Automatic Document Feeders

An MFD uses an automatic document feeder (ADF) to grab pages to copy, scan, or fax. An ADF is typically on top of the MFD and you place a stack of pages in the tray (see Figure 26-22). Different machines require documents face up or face down; they'll typically have some marking to show which way to feed the pages (see Figure 26-23).

Figure 26-22  Typical automatic document feed loaded with pages to copy

Figure 26-23  Wonderfully descriptive markings on MFD telling user to load pages face up in ADF

Connectivity

Most printers, scanners, and multifunction devices connect to a computer via a USB port, but Wi-Fi or Ethernet network connections are also very popular. You'll need to know how to support network connections as well as the plug-and-play USB ones.

USB Connections

New printers and multifunction devices use USB connections that you can plug into any USB port on your computer. USB printers may not come with a USB cable, so you need to purchase one when you purchase a printer. (It's quite a disappointment to come home with your new printer only to find you can't connect it because it didn't come with a USB cable.) Most printers use the standard USB type A connector on one end and the smaller USB type B connector on the other end, although some use two type A connectors. Whichever configuration your USB printer has, just plug in the USB cable---it's that easy!

Network Connections

Connecting a printer or multifunction device to a network isn't just for offices anymore. More and more homes and home offices are enjoying the benefits of network printing. It used to be that you would physically connect the printer to a single computer and then share the printer on the network. The downside to this was that the computer connected to the printer had to be left on for others to use the printer.

Today, the typical network printer comes with its own built-in 802.11 (a, b, g, n, ac, ax) Wi-Fi adapter to enable wireless printing over infrastructure, though you should avoid ad hoc connections for security reasons when possible (see Chapter 20 for more on setting up an ad hoc wireless network).

Other printers include an onboard network adapter that uses a standard RJ-45 Ethernet cable to connect the printer directly to the network by way of a router. The printer can typically be assigned a static IP address, or it can acquire one dynamically from a DHCP server. (Don't know what a router, IP address, or DHCP server is? Take a look back at Chapter 18 and Chapter 19.) Once connected to the network, the printer acts independently of any single computer. Alternatively, some printers offer a Bluetooth interface for networking.

NOTE   Since printers tend to have longer lives than most other computing devices, be aware that printers with a built-in wireless print connection may be using older Wi-Fi or Bluetooth standards than you're used to encountering.

Even if a printer does not come with built-in Ethernet, Wi-Fi, or Bluetooth, you can purchase a standalone network device known as a print server to connect your printer to the network---but beware that you may not be able to use all features of an MFD connected to a print server. These print servers, which can be Ethernet or Wi-Fi, enable one or several printers to attach via USB cable (or even parallel port, if you still have a printer that old). You may not need to go to the store to find a print server, though---check your router, first, to see if it has an integrated print server. If it does, you may be able to plug your printer into a USB port on the router. So take that ancient ImageWriter dot-matrix printer and network it---I dare you!

EXAM TIP   As discussed in Chapter 18 in the context of the roles of networked hosts, print servers aren't necessarily physical devices. You'll find print servers outside network devices. In fact, your Windows system is capable of operating as a print server. Anytime you plug a printer into a computer and share the printer (printer share) over the network, the sharing system can be referred to as a print server.

Physical Installation

Ooh! Few things are more exciting than installing a new printer, scanner, or MDF in your office! While fun (and always a crowd pleaser), you should consider several factors before you pull out the box cutters!

Location

So where do you put this thing? Not only does your new device need to be in a location that is convenient for everyone who needs to use it, but that location should also provide good power and ventilation. Equally, the device ought to be in a place that's not in anyone's way, like a hallway or a person's office, so that no one is constantly interrupted by people grabbing print jobs.

Unboxing

Unboxing a printer or MFD, especially a large office printer or MDF, is a tricky business and one that should be considered with great care. In particular, read the instructions included with the device before you start unboxing it. The instructions should provide very specific steps in which to unbox the various components of the device.

NOTE   All printers and scanners come with internal packaging that must be removed before use. Again, read the documentation to make sure you don't overlook removing from the device a piece of Styrofoam or cardboard.

The Laser Printing Process

The imaging process with a laser printer breaks down into seven steps, and the CompTIA A+ 1101 exam expects you to know them all. As a tech, you should be familiar with these phases, as this can help you troubleshoot printing problems. If an odd line is printed down the middle of every page, for example, you know there's a problem with the imaging drum or cleaning mechanism and the toner cartridge needs to be replaced.

The seven steps to the laser printing process may be performed in a different order, depending on the printer, but it usually goes like this:

1\.   Processing

2\.   Charging

3\.   Exposing

4\.   Developing

5\.   Transferring

6\.   Fusing

7\.   Cleaning

Processing

When you click the Print button in an application, several things happen. First, the CPU processes your request and sends a print job to an area of memory called the print spooler. The print spooler enables you to queue up multiple print jobs that the printer will handle sequentially. Next, Windows sends the first print job to the printer. That's your first potential bottleneck---if it's a big job, the OS has to dole out a piece at a time and you'll see the little printer icon in the notification area at the bottom right of your screen. Once the printer icon goes away, you know the print queue is empty---all jobs have gone to the printer.

Once the printer receives some or all of a print job, the hardware of the printer takes over and processes the image. That's your second potential bottleneck, and it has multiple components.

Raster Images

Impact printers transfer data to the printer one character or one line at a time, whereas laser printers transfer entire pages at a time to the printer. A laser printer generates a raster image (a pattern of dots) of the page, representing what the final product should look like. It uses a device (the laser imaging unit) to "paint" a raster image on the imaging drum. Because a laser printer has to paint the entire surface of the imaging drum before it can begin to transfer the image to paper, it processes the image one page at a time.

A laser printer uses a chip called the raster image processor (RIP) to translate the raster image into commands to the laser. The RIP takes the digital information about fonts and graphics and converts it to a rasterized image made up of dots that can then be printed. An inkjet printer also has a RIP, but it's part of the software driver instead of onboard hardware circuitry. The RIP needs memory (RAM) to store the data that it must process.

A laser printer must have enough memory to process an entire page. Some pages printed at high resolution and containing very complex designs (lots of fonts, complex formatting, high-resolution graphics, and so on) require more memory. Insufficient memory will usually be indicated by a memory overflow ("MEM OVERFLOW") error. If you get a memory overflow or low memory error, try reducing the resolution, printing smaller graphics, reducing the complexity, or turning off RET (see the following section for the last option). Of course, the best solution to a memory overflow error is simply to add more RAM to the laser printer.

Do not assume that every error with the word memory in it can be fixed simply by adding more RAM to the printer. Just as adding more RAM chips will not solve every conventional computer memory problem, adding more RAM will not solve every laser printer memory problem. The message "21 ERROR" on an HP LaserJet, for example, indicates that "the printer is unable to process very complex data fast enough for the print engine." This means that the data is simply too complex for the RIP to handle. Adding more memory would not solve this problem; it would only make your wallet lighter. The only answer in this case is to reduce the complexity of the page image.

Resolution

Laser printers can print at different resolutions, just as monitors can display different resolutions. The maximum resolution a laser printer can handle is determined by its physical characteristics. Laser printer resolution is expressed in dots per inch (dpi), such as 2400 × 600 dpi or 1200 × 1200 dpi. The first number, the horizontal resolution, is determined by how fine a focus can be achieved by the laser. The second number is determined by the smallest increment by which the drum can be turned.

Higher resolutions produce higher-quality output, but keep in mind that higher resolutions also require more memory. In some instances, complex images can be printed only at lower resolutions because of their high memory demands. Even printing at 300 × 300 dpi, laser printers produce far better quality than dot-matrix printers because of resolution enhancement technology (RET).

RET enables the printer to insert smaller dots among the characters, smoothing out the jagged curves that are typical of printers that do not use RET (see Figure 26-24). Using RET enables laser printers to output high-quality print jobs, but it also requires a portion of the printer's RAM. If you get a MEM OVERFLOW error, disabling RET will sometimes free up enough memory to complete the print job.

Figure 26-24  RET fills in gaps with smaller dots to smooth out jagged characters.

Charging

Now we turn to the physical side of the printing process. To make the drum receptive to new images, it must be charged (see Figure 26-25). Using the primary corona wire or primary charge roller, a uniform negative charge is applied to the entire surface of the drum (usually between ~600 and ~1000 volts).

Figure 26-25  Charging the drum with a uniform negative charge

Exposing

A laser is used to create a positive image on the surface of the drum. Every particle on the drum hit by the laser releases most of its negative charge into the drum.

Developing

Those particles with a lesser negative charge are positively charged relative to the toner particles and attract them, creating a developed image (see Figure 26-26).

Figure 26-26  Writing the image and applying the toner

Transferring

The printer must transfer the image from the drum onto the paper. The transfer corona or transfer roller gives the paper a positive charge; then the negatively charged toner particles leap from the drum to the paper. At this point, the particles are merely resting on the paper and must still be permanently fused to the paper.

Fusing

The particles have been attracted to the paper because of the paper's positive charge, but if the process stopped here, the toner particles would fall off the page as soon as you lift it. Because the toner particles are mostly composed of plastic, they can be melted to the page. Two rollers---a heated roller coated in a nonstick material and a pressure roller---melt the toner to the paper, permanently affixing it. Finally, a static charge eliminator removes the paper's positive charge (see Figure 26-27). Once the page is complete, the printer ejects the printed copy and the process begins again with the physical and electrical cleaning of the printer.

Figure 26-27  Transferring the image to the paper and fusing the final image

CAUTION   The heated roller produces enough heat to melt some types of plastic media, particularly overhead transparency materials. This could damage your laser printer (and void your warranty), so make sure you print on transparencies designed for laser printers!

Cleaning

The printing process ends with the physical and electrical cleaning of the imaging drum (see Figure 26-28). Before printing another new page, the drum must be returned to a clean, fresh condition. All residual toner left over from printing the previous page must be removed, usually by scraping the surface of the drum with a rubber cleaning blade. If residual particles remain on the drum, they will appear as random black spots and streaks on the next page. The physical cleaning mechanism either deposits the residual toner in a debris cavity or recycles it by returning it to the toner supply in the toner cartridge. The physical cleaning must be done carefully---a damaged drum will cause a mark to be printed on every page until it is replaced.

Figure 26-28  Cleaning and erasing the drum

The printer must also be electrically cleaned. One or more erase lamps bombard the surface of the drum with the appropriate wavelengths of light, causing the surface particles to discharge into the grounded drum. After the cleaning process, the drum should be completely free of toner and have a neutral charge.

NOTE   Color laser printers use four different colors of toner (cyan, magenta, yellow, and black) to create their printouts. Most models send each page through four different passes, adding one color at each pass to create the needed results, while others place all the colors onto a special transfer belt and then transfer them to the page in one pass. In some cases, the printer uses four separate toner cartridges and four lasers for the four toner colors, and in others the printer simply lays down one color after the other on the same drum, cleaning after each of four passes per page.

Installing a Multifunction Device

Installing a multifunction device differs a lot from installing single-function devices. In the consumer space, the process is messy because of the complexity of the devices. Here's the scoop.

First, most multifunction devices today connect via USB and wirelessly, so you need to consider connectivity. Second, you need to install drivers for each of the various functions of the MFD. Initially, that seems fine, because you can use the driver disc/download that came with the MFD and can install everything for the OS you choose.

That default process can rapidly turn into a mess, though, because of several factors. The drivers are often outdated. Updating specific drivers takes time and clicking. Worse, manufacturers often add absurdly bad applications to "support" specific functions of MFDs, such as special photo organization tools that bog down the system and function far worse than readily available tools like Lightroom from Adobe (not free, but reasonably priced).

Third, you're dealing with a very complex machine that can break in interesting ways. Maintenance and troubleshooting take on new dimensions by the sheer number of options to consider, from ink levels to scanner mechanics to dogged-out phone lines. Although none of these fall into the category of installation, you can minimize the problems by practicing a more compartmentalized installation.

Rather than focus on the multifunction aspect of MFDs, you will often fare better for you and your customers if you think about each function as a separate action. Pull the machine apart in essence, for example, and install a printer, a scanner, a copy machine, and a fax machine. Share these individual parts as needed on a network. Update drivers for each component separately. Conceptualize each function as a separate device to simplify troubleshooting. This way, if your print output goes south, for example, think about the printer aspects of the MFD. You don't have to worry about the scanner, copy, or fax aspects of the machine.

The next sections cover installation of single-function devices, though the bulk of information is on printers. That's both what the CompTIA A+ exams cover and what you'll have to deal with as a tech for the most part.

EXAM TIP   The CompTIA A+ exams test you on installing and troubleshooting printers, so read these sections carefully!

Setting Up Printers in Windows

You need to take a moment to understand how Windows handles printing, and then you'll see how to install, configure, and troubleshoot printers.

To Windows, a printer is not a physical device; it is a program that controls one or more physical printers. The physical printer is called a print device by Windows (although I continue to use the term "printer" for most purposes, just like almost every tech on the planet). Printer drivers and a spooler are still present, but in Windows, they are integrated into the printer itself (see Figure 26-29). This arrangement gives Windows amazing flexibility. For example, one printer can support multiple print devices, enabling a system to act as a print server. If one print device goes down, the printer automatically redirects the output to a working print device.

Figure 26-29  Printer driver and spooler in Windows

The general installation, configuration, and troubleshooting issues are basically identical in all modern versions of Windows. Here's a review of a typical Windows printer installation. Setting up a printer is quite easy. Most printers are plug and play, so installing a printer is reduced to simply plugging it in and loading the driver if needed. With USB printers, Windows won't even wait for you to do anything; Windows immediately detects and installs a printer once you connect it.

If Windows does not immediately detect the printer, you can use the classic Devices and Printers applet in the Control Panel (introduced in the "Sharing Printers" section of Chapter 19), but most users will opt for the simpler Settings | Devices | Printers & scanners interface for setting up a printer (see Figure 26-30). Click the Add a printer or scanner option to find a connectable printer.

Figure 26-30  Printers & scanners in Settings

Standard Users and Printers

A standard user---that is, not an administrator---can install a printer just fine in Windows. The user can also use one of the built-in printer drivers and print fine.

Windows will balk with an "Unable to install printer. Operation could not be completed" error message and accompanying code when the user tries to install software and drivers from an optical disc or downloaded from the Internet. For those options, you need administrative rights.

If you're stuck in that position, such as rolling out corporate laptops to company employees who will want to install printers at home, you can work around the problem. Microsoft suggests changing the Group Policy Driver Installation policy to allow non-administrators to install drivers for printers.

You should be able to find detailed instructions on this if need be at https://docs.microsoft.com. We'll discuss Group Policy editing in Chapter 27.

The Add Printer Wizard and the Settings app both let you install a local printer or a network printer. This distinction is actually a little misleading. Windows divides printer installation into two scenarios: a printer connected directly to a computer (your local system or another one on a network), or a standalone printer directly connected to a switch or router. While you might expect the local and network installation options to divide these scenarios nicely, they don't. Let's take a quick look at both local and network installations so you know when to use each.

Installing a Local Printer

At first glance, you might think the local printer installation option is used to install your standard USB printer, but don't forget that Windows will automatically detect and install USB printers (or any other plug-and-play printer). So what do you use it for? This option is most commonly used to install standalone network printers using an IP address. Using current versions of Windows and a modern printer, you shouldn't need the IP address to install a standalone network printer, but it can be a helpful alternative if Windows refuses to detect it any other way.

If you need to install a standalone network printer, use its hostname or IP address. In Windows, click Add a printer or scanner (shown in Figure 26-30). If Windows doesn't automatically detect your new printer, click The printer that I want isn't listed and select Add a printer using TCP/IP address or hostname. In Windows 10 and 11, both the Settings app and the Control Panel app give you the same choices.

Whether you use a USB port or a TCP/IP port, you'll need to select the proper driver manually (see Figure 26-31). Windows includes a lot of printer drivers, but you can also use the handy Have Disk option to use the disc that came with the printer. If you use the driver included on the disc, Windows will require administrator privileges to proceed; otherwise, you won't be able to finish the installation. The Windows Update button enables you to grab the latest printer drivers via the Internet.

Figure 26-31  Selecting drivers

After clicking the Next button, you'll be asked if the new local printer should be the default printer and whether you want to share it with other computers on the network. And before you ask, yes, you can share a standalone network printer connected to your computer via a TCP/IP port using the File and printer sharing option located at Control Panel | Network and Sharing Center | Change advanced sharing settings, though the printer would be disabled for other users any time you turned off your computer. You'll be asked to print a test page to make sure everything works. Then you're done!

NOTE   Windows-based printer sharing isn't the only game in town. Apple's AirPrint functionality can be used in conjunction with its Bonjour Print Service (installed separately, or along with iTunes) to share a printer connected to a Windows system with AirPrint-compatible macOS and Apple iOS devices.

Installing a Network Printer

Setting up network printers in a typical SOHO LAN doesn't require much more effort than setting up local printers. When you try to install a network printer, the Settings app or Add Printer Wizard will scan for any available printers on your local network. More often than not, the printer you are looking for will pop up in a list (see Figure 26-32). When you select that printer and click Add device or Next, Windows will search for drivers. If you need to, you can pick from a list of available drivers or use the disc that came with the printer. Either way, you're already done.

Figure 26-32  List of available shared printers on a network

If Windows fails to find your printer, you'll need to configure the network printer manually. Every version of Windows includes multiple methods of doing this. These methods change depending on whether you are connected to a domain or a workgroup.

NOTE   Remember printer sharing from Chapter 19? Here's the other side of the operation. Keep in mind that after you install a shared printer onto your computer, you can actually share it with others. Windows considers it your printer, so you can do what you want with it, including sharing it again.

If you are on a workgroup, you can browse for a printer on your network, connect to a specific printer (using its name or URL), or use a TCP/IP address or hostname, as you see in Figure 26-33. In a domain, most of these options remain the same, except that instead of browsing the workgroup, you can search and browse the domain using several search parameters, including printer features, printer location, and more. Once you've found your printer, you might be prompted for drivers. Provide them using the usual methods described earlier and then you are finished!

Figure 26-33  Options for finding network printers

Remember that Windows doesn't always see your network's printers exactly how they are physically arranged. Imagine you have a network with three computers. Andy's computer has a printer connected via USB, whereas Beth's computer and Carol's computer have no printers. There is, however, a second printer connected directly to their router via Ethernet. Beth has configured her system to connect directly to the network printer using an IP address. As a result, she can actually share that printer with the rest of her network, even though it's not attached to her computer---Windows doesn't care where it is. The process for sharing a local printer and a network printer is identical because Windows considers both printers to be installed on your computer and under your control. So now Andy and Beth both share printers. When Carol goes looking for shared printers to use, the network printer attached to the router will look like Beth's printer, as if it were directly connected to Beth's machine.

Figure 26-34 shows the Printers & scanners screen on a system with multiple printers installed. Note the text Default below the printer's name; this shows that the device is the default printer. If you have multiple printers, you can change the default printer by right-clicking the printer's icon and selecting Set as default printer.

Figure 26-34  Installed default printer in Printers & scanners in Settings

In addition to the regular driver installation outlined previously, some installations use printer emulation. Printer emulation simply means using a substitute printer driver for a printer, as opposed to using one made exclusively for that printer. You'll run into printer emulation in two circumstances. First, some new printers do not come with their own drivers. They instead emulate a well-known printer (such as an HP LaserJet) and run perfectly well on that printer driver. Second, you may see emulation in the "I don't have the right driver!" scenario. I keep about three different HP LaserJet and Epson inkjet printers installed on my computer because I know that with these printer drivers, I can print to almost any printer. Some printers may require you to set them into an emulation mode to handle a driver other than their native one.

1102

As you might imagine, setting up printers and MFDs in an enterprise environment differs from the process in a SOHO environment. Here's a scenario. Bayland Widgets Corporation has 30 users who share access to two high-end color laser printers, two very fast black-and-white laser printers, one MFD (mainly used for scanning and copying purposes, but it also prints), and a trio of very nice inkjet printers. The printers and MFD are located in various places for convenience and managed by a single print server.

To make things a lot simpler than going to each client machine and installing these networked printers, Tony the Admin deploys the printers and MFD using Windows group policy to map the correct printers for all 30 workstations (plus several laptops as well). As users log in each morning, the group policy maps the MFD and the closest color laser printer to all of the workstations and laptops. It only maps the high-quality inkjet printers to the marketing department workstations, however, and the fast black-and-white laser printers to accounting. This all happens automatically with the correct drivers loaded as necessary.

NOTE   Sharing a printer or MFD in a SOHO LAN is pretty easy. It's also easy to install a shared network printer. Once you scale up, though, management of many workstations and printers/MFDs becomes a pain unless you map via a group policy that applies to a lot of computers or users. You can also automate printer mapping via an Active Directory domain logon script, as discussed back in Chapter 19.

We'll hit group policy in Chapter 27. But deploying or mapping printers and multifunction devices in this way enables much faster rollout, updates, replacements, and so on.

NOTE   In addition to the Devices and Printers applet, Windows also includes the Print Management console. This tool enables you to view and modify the printers and drivers on your system, connected to your network, or manage any Windows print servers connected to the network. Many of Print Management's advanced features go beyond the scope of the CompTIA A+ exams, but know that it centralizes (and in a few cases, enhances) the standard printer controls in Windows. You can find Print Management in Control Panel | Administrative Tools | Print Management. However, note that Windows 10 Home doesn't offer Print Management.

Configuring Print Settings

Once your printer is installed, a good first stop is the Printing preferences menu, accessible by right-clicking the desired printer in the Devices and Printers applet in the Control Panel. This is where you'll be able to control how your printer will print your documents. Be aware that these settings can vary depending on features available on your printer or multifunction device, but let's take a look at some of the ones you're most likely to find.

Layout

The settings you're most likely to change from time to time are probably the layout settings, which control how the printer determines what to print where.

-   The duplex setting lets you specify whether and how to use each side of a printed page. Simple duplexing will just use the front and back of each sheet sequentially, but you may find more advanced options for laying out booklets.

-   The orientation setting lets you specify whether to print in landscape or portrait mode.

-   The multiple page setting will let you print multiple document pages on each physical page.

-   The scaling setting, not to be confused with the multiple page setting, is usually for fitting a large document to a single page or scaling a small document up to the size of a full page.

-   Reverse or invert options let you print the mirror image of your document, which is useful for printing on transfer paper and other special-use cases.

Paper

Many of the settings you'll find are for telling your printer what kind of paper it will be using, and (especially if the printer has multiple paper trays) where to find it.

-   Set the paper size to one of several common paper sizes or define a custom one.

-   Specify the paper type, which may involve setting thickness, coating, and special formats such as envelopes and labels.

-   A paper source setting will let you select any available paper settings, and possibly manual feed, in which case the printer will wait for you to feed it each sheet individually. This is useful if you need to feed in one-off items or paper that won't fit in the tray.

-   Tray settings allow you to select the printer tray to input the paper (if there are multiple trays). Many printers have the option to choose "automatically select" which also tells the printer to pull the paper from the main tray. When the main tray is out of paper, the printer will automatically choose another tray that has existing paper.

Quality

There are usually a number of different settings that have bearing on quality, but you should be aware that the name or description of some settings that affect quality may discuss ink or toner use (and may as such be located with other ink/toner-related settings).

-   The most obvious of these, resolution, specifies what dpi the document should be printed at.

-   Some printers may let you choose some mode or quality presets that optimize printing for graphics or text or choose to manually configure your own advanced settings.

-   Some printers may have settings that reduce ink or toner used, for economic and environmental reasons.

Other Common Settings

Some print devices offer options useful in specific, but limited, occasions.

-   The apply a watermark setting will let you choose from presets or define your own. A watermark is a lightly printed mark across every page. Use a watermark to designate a draft copy of a document, for example, rather than a final copy.

-   Header/footer settings can be used to add information about when a document was printed and who printed it.

-   A collate option lets you specify the order in which multiple copies of a multi-page document are printed. If the option is unchecked and you print ten copies, each page will be printed ten times before the printer moves on. If the option is checked, the printer will print the full document before starting over.

Optimizing Print Performance

Although a quality printer is the first step toward quality output, your output relies on factors other than the printer itself. If you've ever tweaked a photograph until it looked perfect on your screen only to discover the final printout was darker than you hoped, you made an important discovery. What you see on the screen may not match what comes out of the printer unless both devices are properly calibrated.

Color calibration uses hardware to generate an International Color Consortium (ICC) color profile, a file that defines the color characteristics of a hardware device. The operating system then uses this profile to correct any color shifts in your monitor. With a calibrated monitor, you know any color shifts in your photograph are really in the photo, not an artifact of your monitor.

EXAM TIP   Calibration is a general term for a manual or automatic process that corrects differences between how a device or component currently works and how it should work. All kinds of devices need calibration, but the CompTIA A+ 1101 objectives focus on calibrating inkjet and laser printers. This section describes one kind of calibration---but keep an eye out for additional calibration steps in the "Inkjet Printer Maintenance" and "Laser Printer Maintenance" sections later in this chapter.

Where these ICC color profiles really start to get interesting is that they can be created for printers as well. Just like with a monitor, they let the computer know the unique color quirks of a specific printer on a specific paper. When your printer and monitor have been properly calibrated and the profiles installed, your prints and monitor display should match. Color profiles are sometimes included on the installation media with a printer, but you can create or purchase custom profiles as well. Windows includes Windows Color System (WCS) to help build color profiles for use across devices. WCS is based on a newer component Microsoft calls the color infrastructure and translation engine (CITE).

NOTE   Two of the best monitor calibration hardware manufacturers are Datacolor Spyder---that's the one I use most---and X-Rite ColorMunki Display. Get one. You'll be much happier with your print outcome! Here are the main URLs: https://www.datacolor.com and https://www.xrite.com.

Managing Public/Shared/Networked Devices

While we've looked at a few of the ways you can share a printer or multifunction device over a network, there's more to know about sharing these devices than just how to set them up. A few big issues are network security and data privacy.

Network Print Security

The ease of access that makes wired or wireless network printers and multifunction devices so useful is also a big risk; networked printers are subject to unique security issues. Luckily for us, the CompTIA A+ exams concentrate on just a few basic but important security issues with printer and multifunction devices, so let's look at these.

User Authentication  Allowing only the right people to use a device is an old issue and one that's been covered in one way through user permissions in Windows, but there's more to user authentication. For example, what if you have an expensive color laser printer? Many color laser printers use user authentication to determine, for example, if a user can print color or only black and white. These types of user authentications are based in the printer or printer server but happily work with Windows domains. In Windows 10, printer authentication can be configured in Printers and scanners.

Badging  Who hasn't seen the classic episode of The Office where Dwight requires everyone to use a badge to access the photocopier? While individual codes are rare, user badges that enable you to scan or photocopy are still quite common. These badges use every kind of technology, although NFT is the most common.

Audit Logs  Printers and scanners have audit logs just like any other device. These logs commonly reside in the printer itself, although other solutions work with Windows Event Viewer or Linux Syslog. The bottom line is that if you want to know what happened to a printer, check the logs!

Secured Prints  Ever find yourself printing something you don't want others to see? Do you ever find yourself running to the printer to grab it before anyone can see? That's what secure printing is all about.

Secure printing works by first requiring the user to enter a password or PIN code before a print job starts. After the job is sent to the printer (or print server), the job doesn't automatically print. To make the job print, the user must enter the passcode again at the printer, therefore making sure no one but that user can see the confidential print job.

If you think about it, a lot of sensitive information can pass through a printer or MFD in most organizations, especially in places like schools and hospitals where privacy is strictly regulated. When all of this information passes through the printer or MFD, it's important to make sure it isn't leaking out. Unfortunately, it's common for modern devices to contain a hard drive or other storage media used to cache copies of documents the device prints, scans, copies, or faxes. Depending on the device, you may be able to disable this feature, schedule regular deletion of the cache, or manually clear the cache regularly to limit the amount of damage a compromise could cause. It's also important to clear this information before disposing of the device.

Disabling features like this wouldn't be much good if anyone who could use the device could also change the settings, so enterprise models often allow for user authentication on the device. This can address a number of the risks these devices present by limiting use to authenticated users and restricting the features each user can access to only what they need.

Just because the data on your device is secure doesn't mean documents rolling off of it are free from prying eyes. User authentication can also help out by letting users send documents to the printer but waiting to print them until the user authenticates at the device. It can also minimize some of the risk to unsupervised documents by restricting the ability of less-trusted users to scan/copy/e-mail a document from the device, limiting the ease with which they could steal a copy of an unattended document and leave the original.

NOTE   Every printer is different. Read the documentation included with your printer to learn how you can perform the tasks listed in this section.

1101

Maintaining and Troubleshooting Printers

Once set up, printers tend to run with few issues, assuming that you install the proper drivers and keep the printer well maintained. But printer errors do occasionally develop. This section provides an overview of troubleshooting the most common print problems, as well as problems that crop up with specific printer types.

Maintaining and Troubleshooting General Issues

Printers of all stripes share some common problems, such as print jobs that don't print, strangely sized prints, and misalignment. Other issues include disposing of consumables, sharing multiple printers, and crashing on power-up. Let's take a look at these general troubleshooting issues, but start with a recap of the tools of the trade.

NOTE   Don't forget to check the obvious. Many printers include tiny displays that can clue you in to what's wrong. Most brands use a series of error codes that indicate the problem. Use the manual or the manufacturer's Web site to translate the error code into meaningful information.

Tools of the Trade

Before you jump in and start to work on a printer that's giving you fits, you'll need some tools. You can use the standard computer tech tools in your toolkit, plus a couple of printer-specific devices. Here are some that will come in handy:

-   A multimeter for troubleshooting electrical problems such as faulty wall outlets

-   Various cleaning solutions, such as denatured alcohol

-   An extension magnet for grabbing loose screws in tight spaces and cleaning up iron-based toner

-   An optical disc or USB thumb drive with test patterns for checking print quality

-   Your trusty screwdrivers---both a Phillips-head and flat-head, because if you bring just one kind, it's a sure bet that you'll need the other

Print Job Never Prints

If you click Print but the printer will not print, first check all the obvious explanations. Is the printer on? Is it connected? Is it online? Is there an error message on its display? Does it have paper? Is your computer online?

If the printer is on, the display might have a useful message. It'll usually let you know if the printer is out of paper, has a paper jam that needs to be resolved, or has had a memory full/low memory error. If so, refill the paper, resolve the jam, or try reprinting the job at a lower quality, accordingly.

If you can't connect to the printer, check all cables, ports, and power involved. If everything is plugged in and ready to go, check the printer's display for any indication that it has no connectivity (you may need to navigate its menu system to view its connectivity status). If the printer was previously connected, turn it off for a moment, and then turn it back on and see if it successfully connects. If it doesn't, the menu system will typically have an option to manually configure network settings. Try resetting or manually configuring them.

If the printer does have connectivity, double-check the appropriate printer applet for your version of Windows. If you don't see the printer you are looking for, you'll need to reinstall it.

If you attempt to use a printer shared by another computer but Windows pops up with an "Access Denied" error, you might not have permission to use the printer. Go to the host system and check the Security tab of the Printer Properties dialog box. Make sure your user account is allowed to use the printer.

Assuming the printer is in good order, it's time to look at the spooler. You can see the spooler status either by double-clicking the printer's icon in the appropriate printer Control Panel applet or by double-clicking the tiny printer icon in the notification area if it's present. If you're having a problem, the printer icon will almost always be there. Figure 26-35 shows the print spooler status window open.

Figure 26-35  Print spooler status

Multiple prints pending in a queue can easily overflow or become corrupt due to a lack of disk space, too many print jobs, or one of a thousand other factors. The status window shows all of the pending print jobs and enables you to delete, start, or pause jobs. I usually just delete the affected print job(s) and try again.

Print spoolers are handy. If the printer goes down, you can just leave the print jobs in the spooler until the printer comes back online. If you have a printer that isn't coming on anytime soon, you can simply delete the print job in the spooler window and try another printer.

If you have problems with the print spooler, you can get around them by changing your print spool settings. Go into the Printers/Devices and Printers applet, right-click the icon of the printer in question, and choose Printer properties. In the resulting Properties dialog box (see Figure 26-36), choose the Print directly to the printer radio button on the Advanced tab and click OK; then try sending your print job again. Note that this window also offers you the choice of printing immediately---that is, starting to print pages as soon as the spooler has enough information to feed to the printer---or holding off on printing until the entire job is spooled.

Figure 26-36  Print spool settings

If that isn't enough, try restarting the print spooler service. Right-click the Start button and select Computer Management. In the column on the left, double-click Services and Applications, and then click Services. The Services console should appear in the center of the Computer Management window. Scroll down and find the service named Print Spooler. Right-click the service and simply click Restart, if available; otherwise, click Stop, wait for it to stop, right-click the service again, and select Start. You should be able to print using the print spooler again.

Another possible cause for a stalled print job is incorrect paper size---the printer is simply waiting for the correct paper! Laser printers in particular have settings that tell them what size paper is in their standard paper tray or trays. If the application sending a print job specifies a different paper size---for example, it wants to print a standard No. 10 envelope, or perhaps a legal sheet, but the standard paper tray holds only 8.5 × 11 letter paper---the printer usually pauses and holds up the queue until someone switches out the tray or manually feeds the type of paper that this print job requires. You can usually override this pause, even without having the specified paper, by pressing the OK or GO button on the printer.

The printer's default paper tray and paper size options will differ greatly depending on the printer type and model. To find these settings, go into the printer's Properties dialog box from the Printers/Devices and Printers applet, and then select the Device Settings tab. This list of settings includes Form to Tray Assignment, where you can specify which tray (in the case of a printer with multiple paper trays) holds which size paper.

Strange Sizes

A print job that comes out an unexpected size usually points to a user mistake in setting up the print job. All applications have a Print command and a Page Setup interface. The Page Setup interface enables you to define a number of print options, which vary from application to application. Figure 26-37 shows the Page Setup options for Microsoft Word. Make sure the page is set up properly before you blame the printer for a problem.

Figure 26-37  Page Setup options for Microsoft Word

If you know the page is set up correctly, recheck the printer drivers. If necessary, uninstall and reinstall the printer drivers. If the problem persists, you may have a serious problem with the printer's print engine, but that comes up as a likely answer only when you continually get the same strangely sized printouts using a variety of applications.

Grinding Noises

The only noise you want to hear from your printer is the printing of a document. Sometimes, however, we may try to either stuff too much paper in the tray, or the paper feeder is misaligned and you hear awful grinding noises. All you have to do is realign the paper in the paper feeder. You may also want to take a look at the rollers to see if they need some cleaning.

Finishing Issues/Staple Jams and Hole Punches

Some of the more high-end printers have built-in staplers and capabilities to place hole punches into documents---which is fantastic. However, what is not so great is when you experience a staple jam or hole punch error on your control panel. Fixing a staple jam in a printer is much like fixing a staple jam in a stapler. You open up the stapling mailbox, remove the stapler cartridge and any jammed staples, insert the cartridge back into the stapling mailbox and your stapler jam is fixed. With a hole punch print option there may be compatibility issues when you combine printing options (stapling and hole punch). Also, feeding the paper in horizontally (rather than vertically) sometimes creates some issues.

Incorrect Page Orientation

Have you ever tried to print a document that you intended to output as portrait, but instead came out as a landscape orientation? Incorrect page orientation settings can be easily fixed by going to your Printer settings | Printing preferences | Orientation and selecting which page orientation you would prefer before you print.

Misaligned or Garbage Prints

Misaligned or garbage printouts (CompTIA calls this garbled print) often point to a corrupted or incorrect driver, but it's worth trying to reboot the printer before jumping to conclusions. If that doesn't help, make sure you're using the right driver (it's hard to mess this up, but not impossible) and then uninstall and reinstall the printer driver. If the problem persists, you may be asking the printer to do something it cannot do. For example, you may be printing to a PostScript printer with a PCL driver. Check the printer type to verify that you haven't installed the wrong type of driver for that printer!

If none of these solutions help, it's also worth making sure there isn't a data cable or power issue. Swap out the data cable for one you know is good. Move the printer to another outlet (with no power strip or surge protector). If the printer supports more than one type of connection, try a different one.

Dealing with Consumables

All printers tend to generate a lot of trash in the form of consumables. Impact printers use paper and ribbons, inkjet printers use paper and ink cartridges, and laser printers use paper and toner cartridges. In today's environmentally sensitive world, many laws regulate the proper disposal of most printer components. Be sure to check with the local sanitation department or disposal services company before throwing away any component. Of course, you should never throw away toner cartridges---certain companies will pay for used cartridges!

Both laser printers and computers require more power during their initial power-up (the POST on a computer and the warm-up on a laser printer) than once they are running. HP recommends a reverse power-up. Turn on the laser printer first and allow it to finish its warm-up before turning on the computer. This avoids having two devices drawing their peak loads simultaneously.

NOTE   When in doubt about how to dispose of any computer component, check a material safety data sheet (MSDS). These standardized forms provide detailed information about potential environmental hazards associated with different components but also proper disposal methods. For example, surf to https://epson.com/support/sds to find the latest MSDS for all Epson products. This isn't just a printer issue---you can find an MSDS for most computer components.

EXAM TIP   MSDSs contain important information regarding hazardous materials such as safe use procedures and emergency response instructions. An MSDS is typically posted anywhere a hazardous chemical is used.

NOTE   Used toner cartridges are toxic to the environment, so you need to dispose of them properly. There are some different ways to do this and do your part in saving our earth and water. You can take them to a supply store like Office Depot; place them in a plastic bag and deposit into a green recycle bin; or send them back to the manufacturer.

Incorrect Chroma Display

If you print in color, sooner or later something is going to come out in the wrong color. A good first step is printing out the appropriate diagnostic/test page---this should help separate problems with the printer from problems with what or how you're printing.

Some pretty simple things can cause an incorrect chroma display, so let's check those first. If you print a document with color and it comes out in black and white, double-check both the app you used to print and your print settings to make sure they aren't configured to use grayscale. Double-check the color ink/toner levels.

If something you expected to come out black comes out an odd tone, your printer may be low on black ink/toner. Colors that appear black may be a rich black with other colors mixed in---if there isn't enough black in the mix, you might end up with something unexpected.

If your printer's color registration is out of whack, you might see a sliver of unexpected color (usually cyan, magenta, or yellow) to either side of larger elements. This can be less obvious with text---it may just look blurry, discolored, or appear to have an unexpected shadow. If so, run your printer's registration or alignment routine.

Check the print settings on your system and the printer itself to see if it's configured to adjust any colors. If so, it may be misconfigured. If your printer has a color calibration routine, run it to see if the issue improves. It's also possible your system is using the wrong color profile for either the printer or the monitor. In the first case, your printer might be right and your monitor might be wrong. Make sure your system isn't using an incorrect color profile for either device. If the profiles are correct and you have the right tools to color calibrate either device, go ahead and do so.

Some reasons for color problems are a lot less fun. If your printer has separate cartridges or tanks for different colors, it's possible someone installed the wrong color in one of the slots/tanks. If it's an inkjet, someone will need to spend a good bit of time cleaning the incorrect ink out of the tubing and printheads. If the right colors are in the right slots, a gunked-up printhead may be keeping the printer from laying down the right amount of a color---but the solution will still be cleaning.

No Image on Printer Display

The small menu display screens included on many modern printers and multifunction devices can, like any other display screen, have a number of issues. The display might freeze or get stuck on a specific screen; it might not come on at all; it might light up but never show an image; it might only display a single color, have artifacts such as lines showing on the display, or even just slowly fade from decades of steady use. Unfortunately, there's not a lot you can do about these problems. Turning the device off and back on is a good start, and some manufacturers recommend completely unplugging it for a few minutes. If the screen is still misbehaving but the device is otherwise functional and the problem didn't appear immediately after a firmware update, it's time to take the device to a service center.

Maintaining and Troubleshooting Impact Printers

Maintaining an impact printer is a lot like scheduling regular maintenance on your car. When you treat your car with care and love, it will return the love by not having as many problems and visits to the mechanic. Although maintaining an impact printer may seem overwhelming, this regular maintenance is offset by the few problems you'll encounter with them.

Impact Printer Maintenance

Impact printers require regular maintenance but will run forever as long as you're diligent. Keep the platen (the roller or plate on which the pins impact) and the printhead clean with denatured alcohol. Be sure to lubricate gears and pulleys according to the manufacturer's specifications. Never lubricate the printhead, however, because the lubricant will smear and stain the paper. Don't forget to replace the ink ribbon every so often.

Most impact printers use paper continuously fed from a roll or ream, so changing or replacing the paper is a little more involved than adding sheets to the tray. First you'll need to swap out the rolls or move the new ream into position, and then you'll need to feed the new paper. If there is already paper in the printer, you'll need to finish feeding it out first. Like with other printers, paper quality, debris, and improperly fed paper can all lead to jams, which you'll typically clear by feeding the paper one way or the other.

For all of these processes, look up the printer's documentation; if you don't follow the instructions, there's a chance you'll damage the printer. There's often a manual feeding wheel or roller, or you may just need to pull the paper firmly from one side of the printer; both of these can break the feeding system if performed improperly.

Impact Printer Problems

The primary issues to troubleshoot are bad-looking text and bad-looking pages. White bars going through the text point to a dirty or damaged printhead. Try cleaning the printhead with a little denatured alcohol. If the problem persists, replace the printhead. Printheads for most printers are readily available from the manufacturer or from companies that rebuild them. If the characters look chopped off at the top or bottom, the printhead probably needs to be adjusted. Refer to the manufacturer's instructions for proper adjustment. If the characters have simply degraded or grown faint over time and your printer is used frequently, the printhead may be wearing out; replace it.

Bad-Looking Page

If the page is covered with dots and small smudges---the "pepper look"---the platen is dirty. Clean the platen with denatured alcohol. If the print is faded, and you know the ribbon is good, try adjusting the printhead closer to the platen. If the print is okay on one side of the paper but fades as you move to the other, the platen is out of adjustment. Platens are generally difficult to adjust, so your best plan is to take it to the manufacturer's local warranty/repair center.

Maintaining and Troubleshooting Thermal Printers

Compared to other printer styles, thermal printers are simple to troubleshoot and maintain. With direct thermal printers, you only need to worry about three things: the heating element, the rollers, and the paper. With thermal wax printers, you also need to care for the wax ribbon.

Thermal Printer Maintenance

To clean the heating element, turn off the thermal printer and open it according to the manufacturer's instructions. Use denatured alcohol and a lint-free cloth to wipe off the heating element. You might need to use a little pressure to get it completely clean. Clean the rollers with a cloth or compressed air. Make sure to remove debris so they can properly grip the paper. Replacing the paper is as easy as sliding off the old roll and replacing it with a new one. Remember to feed the paper through the heating element, because otherwise you won't print anything. Replacing the ribbon is similar to replacing the roll of paper; make sure to feed it past the heating element, or the printer won't work properly. Your printer's manufacturer should include any special instructions for installing a new ribbon.

Maintaining and Troubleshooting Inkjet Printers

Maintenance on inkjet printers is interesting. One would think that using a printer on a regular basis would make it prone to more issues, right? Not the inkjet printer. They rely on regular use (but not abuse) to minimize printing issues, therefore minimizing the need to troubleshoot.

Inkjet Printer Maintenance

Inkjet printers are reliable devices that require little maintenance as long as they are used within their design parameters (high-use machines will require more intensive maintenance). Because of the low price of these printers, manufacturers know that people don't want to spend a lot of money maintaining them.

If you perform even the most basic maintenance tasks on inkjet printers, they will soldier on for years without a whimper. Inkjets generally have built-in maintenance programs that you should run from time to time to keep them in good operating order. Inkjet printers don't get nearly as dirty as laser printers, and most manufacturers do not recommend periodic cleaning. Unless your manufacturer explicitly tells you to do so, don't vacuum an inkjet. Inkjets generally do not have maintenance kits, but most inkjet printers come with extensive maintenance software (see Figure 26-38). Usually, the hardest part of using this software is finding it in the first place. Look for an option in Printing Preferences, a selection on the Start menu, or an option on the printer's management Web page. Don't worry---it's there!

Figure 26-38  Inkjet printer maintenance screen

When you first set up an inkjet printer, it normally instructs you to perform a routine to align, or to calibrate the printheads properly. Specifics differ, but the printer will usually print at least one test page and either ask you to place it in the scanner (if it has one) or use the menu to indicate which sets of numbered lines align best. If this isn't done, the print quality will show poor color registration---a fancy way of saying the different color layers that make up your print aren't aligned properly. The good news is that you can perform this procedure at any time. If a printer is moved or dropped or it's just been working away untended for a while, it's often worth running the alignment/registration routine. Some printers will even do this automatically from time to time.

Replacing cartridges in inkjet printers usually is easy, but the exact process can vary widely from printer to printer. Refer to the documentation, but typically you'll open a compartment on the printer and see one or more cartridges attached to the printhead. If the printhead isn't accessible, don't try to force it out; printheads often move to the center of the printer for easy access, in which case you'll need the printer to be on before you replace cartridges.

Cartridges may simply slide into place, but the printer may also have clips to lock them in. Check the clips or slots on the printhead for an indicator of which cartridge goes where. Follow the manufacturer's instructions for removing the cartridge you need to change, then remove the new cartridge from its packaging. Look for a piece of tape or other protective covering over its nozzles or contacts; you'll need to remove that before inserting it. Make sure you follow the insertion process carefully, as an improperly seated cartridge may catch on other components when the printhead moves. Once you insert the new cartridges and close the compartment, the printhead should move back into place.

Did I say that you never should clean an inkjet? Well, that may be true for the printer itself, but there is one part of your printer that will benefit from an occasional cleaning: the inkjet's printer head nozzles. The nozzles are the tiny pipes that squirt the ink onto the paper.

NOTE   All inkjet inks are water-based, and water works better than denatured alcohol to clean them up. Every inkjet printer has a different procedure for cleaning the printhead nozzles. On older inkjets, you usually have to press buttons on the printer to start a maintenance program. On more modern inkjets, you can access the head-cleaning maintenance program from Windows.

CAUTION   Cleaning the heads on an inkjet printer is sometimes necessary, but I don't recommend that you do it on a regular basis as preventive maintenance. The head-cleaning process uses up a lot of that very expensive inkjet ink---so do this only when a printing problem seems to indicate clogged or dirty printheads!

Definitely use inkjet printers regularly---that's good maintenance. Keeping the ink flowing through the printheads prevents them from drying up and clogging. If you don't have anything "real" to print for a week, run a test page.

Inkjet Printer Problems

A common problem with inkjet printers is the tendency for the ink inside the nozzles to dry out when not used even for a relatively short time, blocking any ink from exiting. If your printer is telling Windows that it's printing and feeding paper through, but either nothing is coming out (usually the case if you're just printing black text) or only certain colors are printing, the culprit is almost certainly dried ink clogging the nozzles.

Another problem that sometimes arises is the dreaded multipage misfeed. This is often not actually your printer's fault---humidity can cause sheets of paper to cling to each other---but sometimes the culprit is an overheated printer, so if you've been cranking out a lot of documents without stopping, try giving the printer a bit of a coffee break. Also, fan the sheets of the paper stack before inserting it into the paper tray.

Finally, check to see if excess ink overflow is a problem. In the area where the printheads park, look for a small tank or tray that catches excess ink from the cleaning process. If the printer has one, check to see how full it is. If this tray overflows onto the main board or even the power supply, it will kill your printer. If you discover that the tray is about to overflow, you can remove excess ink by inserting a twisted paper towel into the tank to soak up some of the ink. It is advisable to wear latex or vinyl gloves while doing this. Clean up any spilled ink with a paper towel dampened with distilled water.

Maintaining and Troubleshooting Laser Printers

Quite a few problems can arise with laser printers, but before getting into those details, you need to review some recommended procedures for avoiding those problems.

CAUTION   Before you service a laser printer, always, always turn it off and unplug it! Don't expose yourself to the very dangerous high voltages found inside these machines.

Laser Printer Maintenance

Unlike computer maintenance, laser printer maintenance follows a fairly well-established procedure. Of course, you'll need to replace toner every so often, but keeping your laser printer healthy requires following these maintenance steps.

Keep It Clean  Laser printers are quite robust as a rule. A good cleaning every time you replace the toner cartridge will help that printer last for many years. I know of many examples of original HP LaserJet I printers continuing to run perfectly after a dozen or more years of operation. The secret is that they were kept immaculately clean.

Your laser printer gets dirty in two ways: Excess toner, over time, will slowly coat the entire printer. Paper dust, sometimes called paper dander, tends to build up where the paper is bent around rollers or where pickup rollers grab paper. Unlike (black) toner, paper dust is easy to see and is usually a good indicator that a printer needs to be cleaned. Usually, a thorough cleaning using a can of compressed air to blow out the printer is the best cleaning you can do. It's best to do this outdoors, or you may end up looking like one of those chimney sweeps from Mary Poppins! If you must clean a printer indoors, use a special low-static vacuum---often called a toner vac---designed especially for electronic components, like some of the great products from Metro Vacuum (https://metrovac.com).

Every laser printer has its own unique cleaning method, but the cleaning instructions tend to skip one little area. Every laser printer has a number of rubber guide rollers through which the paper is run during the print process. These little rollers tend to pick up dirt and paper dust over time, making them slip and jam paper. They are easily cleaned with a small amount of 90 percent or better denatured alcohol on a fibrous cleaning towel. The alcohol will remove the debris and any dead rubber. If the paper won't feed, you can give the rollers and separator pads a textured surface that will restore their feeding properties by rubbing them with a little denatured alcohol on a nonmetallic scouring pad.

CAUTION   The imaging drum, usually (but not always) contained in the toner cartridge, can be wiped clean if it becomes dirty, but be very careful if you do so! If the drum becomes scratched, the scratch will appear on every page printed from that point on. The only repair in the event of a scratch is to replace the toner cartridge or imaging drum.

If you're ready to get specific, get the printer's service manual. They are a key source for information on how to keep a printer clean and running. Sadly, not all printer manufacturers provide these, but most do. While you're at it, see if the manufacturer has a Quick Reference Guide; these can be very handy for most printer problems!

Periodic Maintenance  Although keeping the printer clean is critical to its health and well-being, every laser printer has certain components that you need to replace periodically. Your ultimate source for determining the parts that need to be replaced (and when to replace them) is the printer manufacturer. Following the manufacturer's maintenance guidelines will help to ensure years of trouble-free, dependable printing from your laser printer.

Many manufacturers provide kits that contain components that you should replace on a regular schedule. These maintenance kits include sets of replacement parts, such as a fuser, as well as one or more rollers or pads. Typically, you need to reset the page counter after installing a maintenance kit so the printer can remind you to perform maintenance again after a certain number of pages have been printed.

Some ozone filters can be cleaned with a vacuum and some can only be replaced---follow the manufacturer's recommendation. You can clean the fuser assembly with 90 percent or better denatured alcohol. Check the heat roller (the Teflon-coated one with the light bulb inside) for pits and scratches. If you see surface damage on the rollers, replace the fuser unit.

Most printers will give you an error code when the fuser is damaged or overheating and needs to be replaced; others will produce the error code at a preset copy count as a preventive maintenance measure. Again, follow the manufacturer's recommendations.

NOTE   Failure of the thermal fuse (used to keep the fuser from overheating) can necessitate replacing the fuser assembly. Some machines contain more than one thermal fuse. As always, follow the manufacturer's recommendations. Many manufacturers have kits that alert you with an alarm code to replace the fuser unit and key rollers and guides at predetermined page counts.

The transfer corona can be cleaned with a 90 percent denatured alcohol solution on a cotton swab. If the wire is broken, you can replace it; many just snap in or are held in by a couple of screws. Paper guides can also be cleaned with alcohol on a fibrous towel.

As with inkjet printers, some laser printers also have calibration routines to ensure the quality of color prints. Registration routines ensure that each color prints in the correct location, and color calibration ensures that the printer lays down the right amount of each color. Some devices will perform these automatically from time to time. If not, the printer's manual or menu panel should recommend when to run these routines and should walk you through the process.

CAUTION   The fuser assembly operates at 200 to 300 degrees Fahrenheit, so always allow time for this component to cool down before you attempt to clean it.

Laser Printer Problems

Laser printer problems usually result in poor output. One of the most important tests you can do on any printer, not just a laser printer, is called a diagnostic print page or an engine test page. You do this by either holding down the On Line button as the printer is started or using the printer's maintenance software. If the print quality is poor, check for a calibration routine on your device, and see if this resolves the issue.

Faded Prints or Blank Pages  If a laser printer is spitting out faded prints or even printing blank pages, that usually means the printer is running out of toner. If the printer does have toner and nothing prints, print a diagnostic/test page. If that is also blank, remove the toner cartridge and look at the imaging drum inside. If the image is still there, you know the transfer corona or the high-voltage power supply has failed. Check the printer's maintenance guide to see how to focus on the bad part and replace it.

Dirty or Smudged Printouts  If the fusing mechanism in a laser printer gets dirty, it will leave a light dusting of toner all over the paper, particularly on the back of the page. When you see toner speckling on printed pages, you should get the printer cleaned.

If the printout looks smudged or readily rubs off on your fingers, the fuser isn't properly fusing the toner to the paper (CompTIA calls it toner not fusing to paper). Depending on the paper used, the fuser needs to reach a certain temperature to fuse the toner. If the toner won't fuse to the paper, try using a lighter-weight paper. You might also need to replace the fuser.

Double/Echo Images  Echo images sometimes appear at regular intervals on the printed page. This happens when the imaging drum has not fully discharged and is picking up toner from a previous image or when a previous image has used up so much toner that either the supply of charged toner is insufficient or the toner has not been adequately charged. Sometimes it can also be caused by a worn-out cleaning blade that isn't removing the toner from the drum.

Light Echo Images Versus Dark Echo Images  A variety of problems can cause both light and dark echo images, but the most common source of light echo images is "developer starvation." If you ask a laser printer to print an extremely dark or complex image, it can use up so much toner that the toner cartridge will not be able to charge enough toner to print the next image. The proper solution is to use less toner. You can fix echo image problems in the following ways:

-   Lower the resolution of the page (print at 300 dpi instead of 600 dpi).

-   Use a different pattern.

-   Avoid 50 percent grayscale and "dot-on/dot-off patterns."

-   Change the layout so that grayscale patterns do not follow black areas.

-   Make dark patterns lighter and light patterns darker.

-   Print in landscape orientation.

-   Adjust print density and RET settings.

-   Print a completely blank page immediately prior to the page with the echo image, as part of the same print job.

In addition to these possibilities, low temperature and low humidity can aggravate echo image problems. Check your user's manual for environmental recommendations. Dark echo images can sometimes be caused by a damaged drum. It may be fixed by replacing the toner cartridge. Light echo images would not be solved in this way. Switching other components will not usually affect echo image problems because they are a side effect of the entire printing process.

Lines Down the Printed Page  Lines down the printed page usually occur when the toner is clogged, preventing the proper dispersion of toner on the drum. Try shaking the toner cartridge to dislodge the clog. If that doesn't work, replace the toner cartridge.

Blotchy Print  Blotches are commonly a result of uneven dispersion of toner, especially if the toner is low. Shake the toner from side to side and then try to print. Also be sure that the printer is sitting level. Finally, make sure the paper is not wet in spots. If the blotches are in a regular order, check the fusing rollers and the imaging drum for any foreign objects.

Spotty Print  If spots appear at regular intervals, the drum may be damaged or some toner may be stuck to the fuser rollers. Try wiping off the fuser rollers. Check the imaging drum for damage. If the drum is damaged, get a new toner cartridge.

Embossed Effect  If your prints are getting an embossed effect (like putting a penny under a piece of paper and rubbing it with a lead pencil), there is almost certainly a foreign object on a roller. Use 90 percent denatured alcohol or regular water with a soft cloth to try to remove it. If the foreign object is on the imaging drum, you're going to have to use a new toner cartridge. An embossed effect can also be caused by the contrast control being set too high. The contrast control is actually a knob on the inside of the unit (sometimes accessible from the outside, on older models). Check your manual for the specific location.

Incomplete Characters  You can sometimes correct incompletely printed characters on laser-printed transparencies by adjusting the print density. Be extremely careful to use only materials approved for use in laser printers.

Creased Paper  Laser printers have up to four rollers. In addition to the heat and pressure rollers of the fuser assembly, other rollers move the paper from the source tray to the output tray. These rollers crease the paper to avoid curling that would cause paper jams in the printer. If the creases are noticeable, try using a different paper type. Cotton bond paper is usually more susceptible to noticeable creasing than other bonds. You might also try sending the output to the faceup tray, which avoids one roller. There is no hardware solution to this problem; it is simply a side effect of the process.

Paper Jams  Every printer jams now and then. To clear jams, always refer first to the manufacturer's jam removal procedure. It is simply too easy to damage a printer by pulling on the jammed paper! If the printer reports a jam but there's no paper inside, you almost certainly have a problem with one of the many jam sensors or paper feed sensors inside the printer, and you'll need to take it to a repair center.

Multipage Misfeed  If the printer grabs multiple sheets at a time, this is called a multipage misfeed. To fix this issue first try opening a new ream of paper and loading that in the printer. If that works, you have a humidity problem. If the new paper angle doesn't work, check the separation pad on the printer. The separation pad is a small piece of cork or rubber that separates the sheets as they are pulled from the paper feed tray. A worn separation pad looks shiny and, well, worn! Most separation pads are easy to replace.

Paper Not Feeding  If your printer has paper in the tray but you try to print and notice paper not feeding, you might need to clean (or even replace) your printer's pick-up rollers. First, rule out some simple alternatives. Make sure the printer is configured to use the same tray you're expecting it to use. Check the paper: make sure the tray isn't overfilled and confirm the paper there is well aligned, positioned correctly in the tray, and not ripped or bent. See if the weight or coating are different than what you normally use and whether the print settings specify the correct kind of paper. If the paper is different than what you normally use, test whether it'll pick up the normal paper just fine. If the tray has adjustable guides, make sure they aren't holding the paper too tightly.

Warped, Overprinted, or Poorly Formed Characters  Poorly formed characters can indicate either a problem with the paper (or other media) or a problem with the hardware.

Incorrect media cause a number of these types of problems. Avoid paper that is too rough or too smooth. Paper that is too rough interferes with the fusing of characters and their initial definition. If the paper is too smooth (like some coated papers, for example), it may feed improperly, causing distorted or overwritten characters. Even though you can purchase laser printer--specific paper, all laser printers print acceptably on standard photocopy paper. Try to keep the paper from becoming too wet. Don't open a ream of paper until it is time to load it into the printer. Always fan the paper before loading it into the printer, especially if the paper has been left out of the package for more than just a few days.

The durability of a well-maintained laser printer makes hardware a much rarer source of character printing problems, but you should be aware of the possibility. Fortunately, it is fairly easy to check the hardware. Most laser printers have a self-test function---often combined with a diagnostic printout, but sometimes as a separate process. This self-test shows whether the laser printer can properly develop an image without actually having to send print commands from the computer. The self-test is quite handy to verify the question "Is it the printer or is it the computer?" Run the self-test to check for connectivity and configuration problems.

Possible solutions include replacing the toner cartridge, especially if you hear popping noises; checking the cabling; and replacing the data cable, especially if it has bends or crimps or if objects are resting on the cable. If you have a front menu panel, turn off advanced functions and high-speed settings to determine whether the advanced functions are either not working properly or not supported by your current software configuration (check your manuals for configuration information). If these solutions do not work, the problem may not be user serviceable. Contact an authorized service center.

Troubleshooting 3-D Printers

Creating objects by melting and reforming plastic has a lot of potential for a big mess. Common issues include unwanted strings connecting open spaces (called stringing or oozing), overheating to melt part of the final product, and layers shifting so that they don't align properly. All filaments differ in quality, just to make an already complex process more problematic. Using poor-quality filament might save money up front but lead to clogged extruders in short order.

NOTE   CompTIA doesn't specify any maintenance steps for 3-D printers.

Although 3-D printers have been around for a decade or so, the technology still has growing pains. Troubleshooting 3-D printers is way outside the scope of the CompTIA A+ exams, primarily because the processes and such vary tremendously among the many models of printers. For the most part, check the manufacturer's Web site for help. Try one of the many excellent enthusiast sites out there for help guides, such as https://www.fabbaloo.com. Good luck!

Securing Computers

In this chapter, you will learn how to

-   Explain the threats to your computers and data

-   Describe key security concepts and technologies

-   Explain how to protect computers from network threats

Your PC is under siege. Through your PC, malicious people can gain valuable information about you and your habits. They can steal your files. They can run programs that log your keystrokes and thus gain account names and passwords, credit card information, and more. They can run software that takes over much of your computer processing time and use it to send spam or steal from others. The threat is real and immediate. Worse, they're doing these things to your clients as I write these words. You need to secure your computer and your users' computers from these attacks.

But what does computer security mean? Is it an anti-malware program? Is it big, complex passwords? Sure, it's both of these things, but what about the fact that your laptop can be stolen easily or that improper ventilation can cause hard drives and other components to die?

To secure computers, you need both a sound strategy and proper tactics. For strategic reasons, you need to understand the threat from unauthorized access to local machines as well as the big threats posed to networked computers. Part of the big picture is knowing what policies, software, and hardware to put in place to stop those threats. From a tactical in-the-trenches perspective, you need to master the details to know how to implement and maintain the proper tools. Not only do you need to install anti-malware programs in your users' computers, for example, but you also need to update those programs regularly to keep up with the constant barrage of new malware.

Analyzing Threats and Vulnerabilities

Threats to your data and PC come from two directions: accidents and malicious people. All sorts of things can go wrong with your computer, from users getting access to folders they shouldn't see to a virus striking and deleting folders. Files can be deleted, renamed, or simply lost (what Nancy Drew might call "The Case of the Disappearing Files"). Hard drives can die, and optical discs get scratched and rendered unreadable. Accidents happen, and even well-meaning people can make mistakes.

Threats need some way to access a network or facility, whether they are accidental or malicious, internal or external, and that's where vulnerabilities come in. A vulnerability is a weak spot in your defenses that enables a threat to cause harm. Vulnerabilities can exist in an organization's physical security or in its networks. Understanding different types of vulnerabilities and the threats that will try to exploit them is vital to protecting your organization's data, reputation, and safety. We'll look at threats first, followed by vulnerabilities that threats exploit to do their harm.

Threats

Unfortunately, a lot of people out there intend to do you harm. Combine that intent with a talent for computers, and you have a dangerous combination. Let's look at the following issues:

-   Malicious actors

-   Unauthorized access

-   Social engineering

-   Insider threats

-   Data destruction, whether accidental or deliberate

-   Administrative access

-   System crash/hardware failure

-   Physical theft

-   Malware

-   Spam

Malicious Actors

In some cases, the threat in question is an individual, also known as a threat actor. Whether they're an external malicious actor like a hacker or an internal malicious actor like a disgruntled employee, threat actors need some way to use vulnerabilities to their advantage. This is known as an attack, or an exploit. The general order of operations goes something like this: a threat actor identifies one or more vulnerabilities in a network or physical security system, uses some combination of attacks to exploit the vulnerability or vulnerabilities, and proceeds to carry out their nefarious plans. You'll notice that I didn't say that a threat actor will use only one attack or exploit only one vulnerability. There's good reason for this. Very rarely will a malicious actor make use of only one method. For example, a malicious actor attacking from outside the organization may employ a phishing scam to gain user login credentials, use those credentials to gain initial access to a network, then deploy a zero-day attack to take over the network administrator's account.

If some of these terms sound unfamiliar now, don't worry. You're about to get a crash course in some of the many threats and attacks you'll encounter in the world of IT.

EXAM TIP   Be aware that while many of these terms are considered types of attacks, CompTIA's A+ 1102 exam objectives classify them all as social engineering or threats. For the purpose of the 1102 exam, threats and attacks are one and the same, but in most other contexts, threats and attacks are separate concepts.

Zero-Day Attack  A zero-day attack is an attack on a vulnerability that wasn't already known to the software developers. It gets the name because the developer of the flawed software has had zero days to fix the vulnerability. Microsoft, Apple, and other software developers regularly post patches to fix flaws as they're discovered.

Spoofing  Spoofing is the process of pretending to be someone or something you are not by placing false information into your packets. Any data sent on a network can be spoofed. Here are a few quick examples of commonly spoofed data:

-   Source MAC address and IP address, to make you think a packet came from somewhere else

-   E-mail address, to make you think an e-mail came from somewhere else

-   Web address, to make you think you are on a Web page you are not on

-   Username, to make you think a certain user is contacting you when in reality it's someone completely different

Generally, spoofing isn't so much a threat as it is a tool to make threats. If you spoof my e-mail address, for example, that by itself isn't a threat. If you use my e-mail address to pretend to be me, however, and to ask my employees to send in their usernames and passwords for network login? That's clearly a threat. (And also a waste of time; my employees would never trust me with their usernames and passwords.)

On-Path Attack  In an on-path attack, an attacker taps into communications between two systems, covertly intercepting traffic thought to be only between those systems, reading or in some cases even changing the data and then sending the data on. A classic on-path attack would be a person using special software on a wireless network to make all the clients think his laptop is a wireless access point. He could then listen in on that wireless network, gathering up all the conversations and gaining access to passwords, shared keys, or other sensitive information.

EXAM TIP   While CompTIA prefers and uses the term on-path attack, you'll more commonly hear it referred to by its original name, man-in-the-middle, out in the world. Just be aware that the two terms are interchangeable, and that on-path attack is how it will be referred to on the exam.

Session Hijacking  Somewhat similarly to on-path attacks, session hijacking tries to intercept a valid computer session to get authentication information. Unlike on-path attacks, session hijacking only tries to grab authentication information, not necessarily listening in like an on-path attack.

Brute-Force Attack  CompTIA describes brute force as a threat, but it's more of a method that threat agents use. Brute force is a method where a threat agent guesses many or all possible values for some data. Most of the time the term brute force refers to an attempt to crack a password, but the concept also applies to other attacks. You can brute force a search for open ports, network IDs, usernames, and so on. Pretty much any attempt to guess the contents of some kind of data field that isn't obvious (or is hidden) is considered a brute-force attack.

There are two other tools attackers use to brute force passwords: dictionaries and rainbow tables. A dictionary attack is a form of brute-force attack that essentially guesses every word in a dictionary. Don't just think of Webster's dictionary---a dictionary used to attack passwords might contain every password ever leaked online.

Before we can talk about rainbow tables, we need to look closer at password leaks. One (terrible!) way to authenticate users is to save a copy of their password in a database and check it every time they log in. Hackers love to steal these databases because they can go try the username and password on popular services, and use the passwords to improve the dictionaries they use to guess passwords.

In response to this threat, authentication systems only save a special value (called a hash) computed from the password; each time the user logs in, the system re-computes this special value and compares it with the saved copy. If an attacker steals one of these databases, they only get a bunch of usernames and hashes. Hashes are special because the computation that creates them is irreversible; the only way to figure out what password produced a given hash is to guess a password, perform the same computation, and see if the hashes match.

Attackers fought back by pre-computing large lookup tables---known as hash tables---of passwords and the corresponding hash. When they find a large database of hashed passwords, they can just look up the corresponding password in their hash table. Hash tables for passwords more than a few characters long eat tons of storage space, so they're turned into rainbow tables to save space (at the expense of a little speed and accuracy.) Rainbow tables use complicated math to condense dictionary tables with hashed entries dramatically. They're binary files, not text files, and can store amazing amounts of information in a relatively small size. Rainbow tables generally fall into the realm of CompTIA Security+ or even higher-level certifications, but the phrase has become common enough that CompTIA A+ techs need to know what it means.

Denial of Service  A denial of service (DoS) attack uses various methods to overwhelm a system, such as a Web server, to make it essentially nonfunctional. DoS attacks were relatively common in the early days of the Web. These days you'll see distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks that use many machines simultaneously to assault a system. A DDoS attack is generally executed using a botnet. A botnet consists of any number (usually a large one) of systems infected with malware designed to allow them to be controlled by an attacker and used to send disruptive traffic designed to bring down a resource. You'll get a closer look at botnets and how they work later on in the chapter when we discuss malware.

Cross-Site Scripting  Most companies have Web sites, and Web sites can sometimes be very vulnerable to attacks by the bad guys. One such attack that can pose a threat to your Web applications is known as cross-site scripting. Cross-site scripting (XSS) is an attack in which the attacker injects malicious code into the Web app in order to trick it into sending things it shouldn't to other users of the Web site. Generally, this occurs due to errors in the application's code, which the attacker finds and exploits. XSS can lead to account takeovers, stolen data, or even a full takeover of the Web site or app. The nitty-gritty details of XSS, specific variants of the attack, and how to prevent them are things you'll learn more about in CompTIA Security+, but for the CompTIA A+ 1102 exam, be aware that cross-site scripting can pose a major threat to an organization's Web site(s).

SQL Injection  You've most likely deduced by now that accessing, stealing, and destroying data are common goals of malicious actors, so let's take a look at one of the favorite methods hackers use to achieve them. Before I can tell you about the dreaded SQL injection, I'm going to have to tell you what SQL is. SQL is an acronym for Structured Query Language. SQL is a language that enables a program to interact with a database using various commands and queries. If you've started thinking that attacking a database sounds like a dangerous threat, you're right. An SQL injection occurs when an attacker enters SQL commands into an input field like you'd see in a Web app, in order to gain access to data in a database that they shouldn't be able to see. You won't need to know the ins and outs of how SQL injection is performed, but know that preventing it is done at the programming level, with something known as input validation.

Unauthorized Access

Unauthorized access occurs when a person accesses resources without permission. "Resources" in this case means data, applications, and hardware. A user can alter or delete data; access sensitive information, such as financial data, personnel files, or e-mail messages; or use a computer for purposes the owner did not intend.

Not all unauthorized access is malicious---often this problem arises when users who are poking around in a computer out of curiosity or boredom discover they can access resources in a fashion the primary user did not have in mind. Unauthorized access becomes malicious when people knowingly and intentionally take advantage of weaknesses in your security to gain information, use resources, or destroy data!

One way to gain unauthorized access is intrusion. You might imagine someone kicking in a door and hacking into a computer, but more often than not it's someone sitting at a home computer, trying various passwords over the Internet. Not quite as glamorous, but it'll do. Another insidious method is manipulating people into giving privileged information or access that would be otherwise unavailable to a would-be attacker. This takes us into a discussion of one of the most common and dangerous categories of threats.

Social Engineering

Although you're more likely to lose data through accidents, the acts of malicious users get the headlines. Most of these attacks come under the heading of social engineering---the process of using or manipulating people inside the organization to gain access to its network or facilities---which covers the many ways humans can use other humans to gain unauthorized information. This information may be a network login, a credit card number, company customer data---almost anything you might imagine that one person or organization may not want outsiders to access.

NOTE   Social engineering attacks are often used together, so if you discover one of them being used against your organization, it's a good idea to look for others.

Social engineering attacks aren't hacking---at least in the classic sense of the word---but the goals are the same and the attacks will often be used by hackers in conjunction with other methods. Let's look at a few of the more classic types of social engineering attacks.

Infiltration  Hackers can use impersonation to enter your building physically disguised as cleaning personnel, repair technicians, messengers, and so on. They then snoop around desks, looking for whatever they can find. They might talk with people inside the organization, gathering names, office numbers, department names---little things in and of themselves but powerful tools when combined later with other social engineering attacks.

Dressing the part of a legitimate user---with fake badge and everything---enables malicious people to gain access to locations and thus potentially your data. Following someone through the door, for example, as if you belong, is called tailgating. Tailgating is a common form of infiltration.

To combat tailgating, facilities often install an access control vestibule at the entrance to sensitive areas, or sometimes at the entrance to the whole building. Traditionally called a mantrap, an access control vestibule is a small room with a set of two doors, one to the outside, unsecured area and one to the inner, secure area. When walking through the access control vestibule, the outer door must be closed before the inner door can be opened. In addition to the double doors, the user must present some form of authentication. For additional security, an access control vestibule is often controlled by a security guard who keeps an entry control roster. This document keeps a record of all comings and goings from the building.

Information Gathering  You're probably familiar with the old saying that "knowledge is power." The good news is that when it comes to securing systems and facilities, the saying is true. The bad news is that it's also true when someone is trying to compromise those systems and facilities. Social engineering is often used by threat actors to gather information that makes it easier for them to successfully gain access. Here are some common ways that they get ahold of information that they aren't supposed to have.

Dumpster diving is the generic term for searching garbage for information. This is also a form of intrusion. The amount of sensitive information that makes it into any organization's trash bin boggles the mind! Years ago, I worked with an IT security guru who gave me and a few other IT people a tour of our office's trash. In one 20-minute tour of the personal wastebaskets of one office area, we had enough information to access the network easily, as well as to seriously embarrass more than a few people. When it comes to getting information, the trash is the place to look!

Shoulder surfing is another technique for gathering information and gaining unauthorized access. Shoulder surfing is simply observing someone's screen or keyboard to get information, often passwords. As the name implies, it usually requires the bad guy looking over your shoulder to see what you are doing.

Vishing  Vishing is one of the most common social engineering attacks. In this case, the attacker makes a phone call to someone in the organization to scam them into revealing information gain information. The attacker attempts to come across as someone inside the organization and uses this to get the desired information. Probably the most famous of these scams is the "I forgot my username and password" scam. In this gambit, the attacker first learns the account name of a legitimate person in the organization, usually using the infiltration method. The attacker then calls someone in the organization, usually the help desk, in an attempt to gather information, in this case a password.

Hacker: "Hi, this is John Anderson in accounting. I forgot my password. Can you reset it, please?"

Help Desk: "Sure, what's your username?"

Hacker: "j_w_anderson."

Help Desk: "OK, I reset it to e34rd3."

Vishing certainly isn't limited to attempts to get network access. There are documented vishing attacks against organizations aimed at getting cash, blackmail material, or other valuables.

Phishing  Phishing is the act of trying to get people to give their usernames, passwords, or other security information by pretending to be someone else electronically. A classic example is when a bad guy sends you an e-mail that's supposed to be from your local credit card company asking you to send them your username and password. Phishing is by far the most common form of social engineering done today.

Phishing refers to a fairly random act of badness. The attacker targets anyone silly enough to take the bait. Spear phishing is the term used for targeted attacks, like when a bad guy goes after a specific celebrity. The dangerous thing about spear phishing is that the bait can be carefully tailored using details from the target's life. A particularly dangerous form of phishing specifically targets people who are high up in an organization, such as executives or administrators. This is known as whaling.

Evil Twin  One of the reasons infiltrations can be so dangerous is that a malicious actor may be able to plant devices inside an organization's network. A particularly dangerous example of this is known as an evil twin. An evil twin is a fake wireless access point configured to mimic the traits of a legitimate device and network, in order to lure unsuspecting users to connect to the attacker's device. By doing this, the attacker can snoop on Internet traffic, steal user credentials, and use this information to do additional damage.

Insider Threats

Threats to your network or facility don't only come from the outside. Sometimes, the threat exists within the organization itself. This is known as an insider threat. An insider threat is any security risk that originates from a person inside an organization. Sometimes, the insider in question is malicious, out to steal funds or information. They may also be a disgruntled current or former employee looking to get back at the company.

Don't make the mistake of thinking that all insider threats are malicious though---sometimes accidents happen, and the insider threat is a well-meaning person just trying to make their or someone else's job easier. The real threat here is the access to systems and facilities that they have and what they can do with it. There are several ways to mitigate the risks of insider threats, most which center on access control. Only giving users access to what they need to do their jobs and deleting relevant user and administrator accounts when someone leaves the company are both examples of insider threat mitigation. Some methods to mitigate the risk of insider threats will be discussed in greater detail later in the chapter in the "Logical Security" section.

Data Destruction

Often an extension of unauthorized access, data destruction means more than just intentionally or accidentally erasing or corrupting data. It's easy to imagine some evil hacker accessing your network and deleting all your important files, but authorized users may also access certain data and then use that data beyond what they are authorized to do. A good example is the person who legitimately accesses a Microsoft Access product database to modify the product descriptions, only to discover that she can change the prices of the products, too.

This type of threat is particularly dangerous when users are not clearly informed about the extent to which they are authorized to make changes. A fellow tech once told me about a user who managed to mangle an important database when someone gave him incorrect access. When confronted, the user said: "If I wasn't allowed to change it, the system wouldn't let me do it!" Many users believe that systems are configured in a paternalistic way that wouldn't allow them to do anything inappropriate. As a result, users often assume they're authorized to make any changes they believe are necessary when working on a piece of data they know they're authorized to access.

Administrative Access

Every operating system enables you to create user accounts and grant those accounts a certain level of access to files and folders in that computer. As an administrator, supervisor, or root user, you have full control over just about every aspect of the computer. This increased control means these accounts can do vastly more damage when compromised, amplifying the danger of several other threats. The idea is to minimize both the number of accounts with full control and the time they spend logged in.

Even if a user absolutely needs this access, uses strong passwords, and practices good physical security, malware installed by a convincing spear phishing attack could leverage that control to access files, install software, and change settings a typical account couldn't touch.

System Crash/Hardware Failure

As with any technology, computers can and will fail---usually when you can least afford for it to happen. Hard drives crash, the power fails . . . it's all part of the joy of working in the computing business. You need to create redundancy in areas prone to failure (such as installing backup power in case of electrical failure) and perform those all-important data backups. A security-specific example would be having redundant firewalls to protect the network in the event that one of them fails. Chapter 14 goes into detail about using backups and other issues involved in creating a stable and reliable system.

Physical Theft

A fellow network geek once challenged me to try to bring down his newly installed network. He had just installed a powerful and expensive firewall router and was convinced that I couldn't get to a test server he added to his network just for me to try to access. After a few attempts to hack in over the Internet, I saw that I wasn't going to get anywhere that way.

So, I jumped in my car and drove to his office, having first outfitted myself in a techy-looking jumpsuit and an ancient ID badge I just happened to have in my sock drawer. I smiled sweetly at the receptionist and walked right by my friend's office (I noticed he was smugly monitoring incoming IP traffic by using some neato packet-sniffing program) to his new server.

I quickly pulled the wires out of the back of his precious server, picked it up, and walked out the door. The receptionist was too busy trying to figure out why her e-mail wasn't working to notice me as I whisked by her carrying the 65-pound server box. I stopped in the hall and called him from my cell phone.

Me (cheerily): "Dude, I got all your data!"

Him (not cheerily): "You rebooted my server! How did you do it?"

Me (smiling): "I didn't reboot it---go over and look at it!"

Him (really mad now): "YOU <EXPLETIVE> THIEF! YOU STOLE MY SERVER!"

Me (cordially): "Why, yes. Yes, I did. Give me two days to hack your password in the comfort of my home, and I'll see everything! Bye!"

I immediately walked back in and handed him the test server. It was fun. The moral here is simple: Never forget that the best network software security measures can be rendered useless if you fail to protect your systems physically!

Protecting Laptops  Physical security for your systems extends beyond the confines of the office as well. The very thing that makes laptops portable also makes them tempting targets for thieves. One of the simplest ways to protect your laptop is to use a basic cable lock. The idea is to loop the cable around a solid object, such as a bed frame, and secure the lock to the small security hole on the side of the laptop.

Malware

Networks are without a doubt the fastest and most efficient vehicles for transferring computer viruses among systems. News reports focus attention on the many malicious software attacks from the Internet, but a huge number of such attacks still come from users who bring in programs on optical discs and USB drives. The "Network Security" section of this chapter describes the various methods of virus infection and other malware and what you need to do to prevent such attacks from damaging your networked systems.

Spam

If you have an e-mail address, there's a 100 percent chance that you've seen spam at some point in your life. Spam is the digital equivalent of junk mail; it's bulk e-mail sent out to as many people as possible in the hopes that at least some of them engage with it. Sometimes spam is just an annoyance, but it can also be a threat to your network. Phishing attempts, malicious links, and attachments that contain malware are just some of the dangers that spam can present. Spam management methods and tools were covered in detail back in Chapter 19.

Vulnerabilities

Threats to your computers and facilities can be scary, but they need some way to gain access before they can cause trouble. Threats compromise a system by exploiting vulnerabilities in a computer, network, company policy, or physical security to gain access. Once a vulnerability is exploited, whether by an outside hacker, a disgruntled employee, or even inadvertently by a well-meaning person just trying to make their job easier, chaos can ensue. Data deletion, data theft, extortion, and all sorts of other nasty things can happen if vulnerabilities aren't identified and addressed. As a CompTIA A+ technician, you likely won't be expected to know the nitty-gritty details of how to fix all vulnerabilities, but you should understand the fundamentals of different types of vulnerability, and how they can threaten an organization. Here are a few common vulnerabilities that you may run across while working as a technician.

Have you ever been working on your computer, playing a game, or having a Zoom meeting, and suddenly your operating system nags you to install updates that require a reboot? I know I have, and as disruptive as that can be, the disruptions that could result from ignoring those messages are even worse. That's because these warnings are telling you to patch your operating system, and oftentimes, those patches are intended to address a security risk. Unpatched systems are vulnerable to an ever-growing list of vulnerabilities that attackers know about and are actively exploiting. Leaving a system unpatched is like leaving a second-story window open while you go on vacation. Sure, you may get home and see that everything is fine, but you may also have been robbed blind. Patching systems is key and will be discussed in more detail later in this chapter when we address malware prevention.

If leaving your systems unpatched is like leaving a second-story window open when you go on vacation, an unprotected system is like leaving your front door open with a sign on the lawn inviting people to break in. An unprotected system lacks key security tools like anti-malware software and firewalls. Without these in place, there is nothing stopping a hacker from doing whatever they want in your network. They can send malware, try to connect directly to your internal network, and try to steal or destroy your sensitive information, and do all of this with a relatively low chance of being detected. An unprotected system is a serious vulnerability, whether it's at home, in a small business, or in a major corporation. If you must have unprotected systems, make sure to isolate and monitor them!

Operating systems also have lifespans. Over time, as new and sometimes improved operating systems launch, older ones are phased out. Once an old OS is phased out completely, it stops receiving security updates as new vulnerabilities are discovered. These operating systems are known as end-of-life (EOL) operating systems and can present a major vulnerability to a network if even one device is still using an EOL OS. It's a fairly common problem, because operating system upgrades can be expensive and disruptive to a business's operations. Regardless, making sure that operating systems are well supported and still receiving regular security updates is an important way to mitigate vulnerabilities.

While the concept of bring your own device (BYOD) was discussed in the context of securing mobile devices back in Chapter 25, the potential security risks extend past mobile devices to personal laptops as well. While BYOD may be popular with employees and more friendly to an organization's budget, BYOD can also be a security vulnerability. An external threat can use the fact that personal devices may not all be maintained with standard security features to gain access from the outside. Additionally, insider threats, whether malicious or accidental, can use personal devices to introduce malware, or remove privileged data from the security of the company's internal network.

In the best of all possible worlds, your organization will use a mix of policies, systems, and elbow grease to ensure the devices in your networks never have vulnerabilities like these. But in reality, a system may need to defer updates for weeks while it's busy rendering special effects. Users may need time to comply or need network access to do it. The accounting department might require software that only works on an EOL OS. A computer that serves as the interface to an old ICS system may not even have a software firewall (we'll look at these later in the chapter). Unless you check compliance continually, new violations will appear between checks. In short, compliance is an aspiration, and you'll often have to manage the vulnerabilities and risks that non-compliant systems represent (often by isolating them and monitoring them well).

Security Concepts and Technologies

Once you've assessed the threats to your computers and networks, you need to take steps to protect those valuable resources. Depending on the complexity of your organization, this can be a small job encompassing some basic security concepts and procedures, or it can be exceedingly complex. The security needs for a three-person desktop publishing firm, for example, would differ wildly from those of a defense contractor supplying top-secret toys to the Pentagon.

From a CompTIA A+ certified technician's perspective, you need to understand the big picture (that's the strategic side), knowing the concepts and available technologies for security. At the implementation level (that's the tactical side), you're expected to know where to find such things as security policies in Windows. A CompTIA Network+ or CompTIA Security+ tech will give you the specific options to implement. (The exception to this level of knowledge comes in dealing with malicious software such as viruses, but we'll tackle that subject in the second half of the chapter.)

Controlling access is the key. If you can control access to the data, programs, and other computing resources, you've secured your systems. Access control is composed of interlinked areas of physical and logical security that a good security-minded tech should think about: physical security, authentication, users and groups, and security policies. Much of this you know from previous chapters, but this section should help tie it all together as a security topic. The first step is understanding physical security, which includes methods of preventing physical access to facilities, systems, and information, and the second is understanding logical security to learn how to protect your network, authenticate users, and employ effective security policies.

Physical Security

For most people, when they hear the word security, the first thing they think of are things like guards, fences, security cameras, and the like. That's because they're thinking about physical security. Physical security is often the first line of defense for an organization. It includes the fences and gates that keep people off the property, the locks that keep people from entering a building or area they aren't supposed to, and the guards who use surveillance tools and alerts to keep an eye on things. Physical security is all about defending facilities and systems from---you guessed it---physical threats, both internal and external. There are layers to physical security that can and often do overlap with logical security tools to provide effective security coverage. Let's start our investigation by looking at some specific goals and methods of physical security.

Securing Facilities

The first order of security is limiting access to your physical hardware. The security market is huge, but the options basically boil down to fences, doors, locks, alarms, and keeping a close eye on things. The first step is understanding that all of these pieces can (and will) fail or be beaten; great security involves arranging and layering many pieces so that they can enhance each other's strengths and compensate for each other's weaknesses.

Think back to the access control vestibule introduced earlier in the chapter. A low-tech solution like a traditional door lock is just a speed-bump to someone with a lock-pick and a moment alone with the lock. Access control vestibules are great because they combine simple measures like doors, door locks, security guards, and an entry control roster in a way that is much harder to beat than one or two locked doors. Some facilities may enhance their entrance security further by adding a magnetometer, better known as a metal detector. As pointed out earlier in the chapter when we talked about different types of threats, some threats originate from inside the organization as well as outside. A metal detector is a good way to help prevent people from bringing in dangerous items that they could use to cause harm, and to prevent them from walking out with something that doesn't belong to them.

Sometimes access control needs to be extended past the door itself, out to the property. Many facilities have more than one entrance, or multiple buildings. As a result, organizations may add an additional line of defense to keep unauthorized people off company property altogether. Fences are often used to stop people from snooping around where they aren't supposed to. Bollards, those short concrete or metal posts that you'll sometimes see in areas with heavy foot traffic, can be used to prevent vehicles from getting too close for comfort (see Figure 27-1).

Figure 27-1  Example of a bollard

Security guards are great, but they can't be everywhere at once. They need some way to keep an eye on things. That's where the following tools come into play:

-   Video surveillance can be used by security personnel to monitor the facility from a centralized location.

-   Good lighting makes it harder for a would-be bad guy to avoid detection, with the added benefit of decreasing the likelihood of workplace accidents for staff.

-   Motion sensors can be used to let them know if someone or something is detected so they can take a closer look.

-   Alarm systems can serve a variety of functions, from warning the IT department of an attempted network breach, to informing staff of a security issue, to alerting security staff or law enforcement if a break-in happens after hours.

Any combination of these tools makes a great addition to a robust security plan, but it's also important to make sure that people inside the organization don't have access to things they aren't supposed to. This brings us to the next set of access control options.

Traditional door locks aren't terrible, but keys are easy to copy and the cost of frequently re-keying locks adds up fast. An organization ready to move beyond the basics can step up to a keyless lock system driven by employee ID badges---especially ones with authentication tools such as radio frequency identification (RFID) or smart cards (see "Authentication," later in this chapter)---to control building and room access. Figure 27-2 shows a typical badge.

Lock Down Systems

Once an attacker has physical access to the building, protecting your hardware gets a lot harder. There are some options here, but don't plan on them doing much more than slow someone down by a few minutes and make it obvious to anyone watching that they're up to no good:

-   Lock the doors to your workspaces. A fast, reliable keyless lock system can make it painless to lock them even when the user steps out for a moment.

-   Equipment locks can keep someone from quickly walking off with the hardware.

-   USB locks make it harder to plug in a USB drive to load malware for stealing data.

-   RJ45 locks limit an intruder's ability to gain access to the wired network.

-   Server locks limit access to a server's ports and drives. There are also locking rack doors to limit access to the front or back of an entire server rack.

These devices are meaningless if an intruder can walk in like they belong, sit down at an unattended, logged-in computer, and get to work. Don't leave a logged-in PC unattended, even if it's just a Standard or Guest user. May the gods help you if you walk away from a server still logged in as an administrator. You're tempting fate.

If you must step away for a moment, manually lock the computer (or screen) with a hotkey or the primary OS menu. On a Windows system, just press WINDOWS-L on the keyboard to lock it. It's also a good idea to set up a screensaver with a short wait time and configure it to show the logon screen on resume.

EXAM TIP   If you're in charge of multiple-user security best practices, using screensaver locks---configured to show the logon screen on resume---can help a lot with users who might forget to lock their systems when taking a break or going to lunch. Both Windows and macOS enable you to take this a step further and set automatic timeout and a screen lock, where the screen goes blank after a few minutes and a password is required for logon.

Protect Sensitive Information

Locking unattended systems is a great habit, but it won't help much if the intruder manages to watch the user enter their password or is able to read it off a sticky note on the monitor. Don't write down passwords and leave them in plain sight. Teach users to follow the strong password guidelines set forth in Chapter 13. Be aware of the risk of shoulder surfing. Ideally, the office layout should make it impossible for someone to watch the user without their knowledge.

If users need to work with sensitive information anywhere someone unauthorized could see the screen, they may need a privacy filter (also called a privacy screen)---a framed sheet or film that you apply to the front of your monitor. Privacy filters reduce the viewing angle, making it impossible to see the screen unless you're directly in front of it (see Figure 27-3). Lock up paper copies of critical, personal, or sensitive documents out of sight and shred any you don't need immediately.

Figure 27-3  Privacy filter

Logical Security

While physical security is focused on preventing unauthorized access to facilities and equipment, logical security is primarily focused on denying access to computers and data. Logical and physical security features are generally combined for maximum effectiveness. In some cases, like with biometrics, the security tool can be used for both logical and physical security applications. Let's dig deeper into some of the more commonly implemented logical security controls.

MAC Address Filtering

It's far from bulletproof, but if an attacker does gain physical access to your site, you may be able to throw up another hurdle to limit their ability to access your network with any of their own devices. Both wired and wireless networks can use MAC filtering to enable you to blacklist or whitelist devices based on their MAC address.

Use a blacklist to block specific computers, adding their MAC addresses to the ranks of the undesired. You can use a whitelist to pre-specify the only MAC addresses allowed access. I say this isn't bulletproof because a savvy attacker can spoof an address (they'll have a much easier time sniffing a valid Wi-Fi MAC address than a wired one, though) from another device accessing the network.

Keeping devices you don't control out of your network is a big win! If the attacker can't gain access to your network with one of their own devices (which they have probably preloaded with tools for attacking your systems or network), they'll have to resort to breaking into one of your devices to do the heavy lifting.

MAC addresses aren't the only way to filter traffic to and from your network. IP addresses can also be used to help keep unwanted traffic from entering or leaving your network. Like MAC filtering, IP filtering is a tool often available with routers and firewalls. IP filtering enables an administrator to set rules about whether packets should be sent or received based on the source or destination IP address. IP filtering isn't a surefire solution to security issues, but it can be an extra hurdle in the same way MAC filtering is.

Authentication

Security requires properly implemented authentication, which means in essence how the computer determines who can or should access it and, once accessed, what that user can do. A computer can authenticate users through software or hardware, or a combination of both.

You can categorize ways to authenticate into three broad areas: knowledge factors, ownership factors, and inherence factors. You read about multifactor authentication in detail in Chapter 25 in the context of mobile device security. It works the same way when securing a desktop computer, a laptop, a server, or a building. There's no reason to rehash it here. The only thing to add is that many organizations use two-factor authentication. An example is a key fob that generates a numeric key. A user authenticates by entering his or her username and password (something the user knows) and enters the key (something the user has) when prompted. Another popular method of authentication is to use an authenticator application. An authenticator application adds an additional layer of security similar to many multifactor authentication methods, by generating some form of key or password to be entered in conjunction with standard login credentials.

EXAM TIP   The CompTIA A+ 1102 exam will quiz you on multifactor and two-factor authentication. This applies to all computing devices.

Software Authentication: Proper Passwords  It's still rather shocking to me to power up a friend's computer and go straight to his or her desktop, or with my married-with-kids friends, to click one of the parents' user account icons and not be prompted for a password. This is just wrong! I'm always tempted to assign passwords right then and there---and not tell them the passwords, of course---so they'll see the error of their ways when they try to log on next. I don't do it but always try to explain gently the importance of good passwords.

You know about passwords from Chapter 13, so I won't belabor the point here. Suffice it to say that you must require that your users have proper passwords. Don't let them write passwords down or tape them to the underside of their mouse pads either!

It's not just access to Windows that you need to think about. There's always the temptation for people to do other mean things, such as change CMOS settings, open up the case, and even steal hard drives. Any of these actions renders the computer inoperable to the casual user until a tech can undo the damage or replace components. All modern CMOS setup utilities come with a number of tools to protect your computer, such as drive lock, intrusion detection, and of course system access BIOS/UEFI passwords such as the one shown in Figure 27-4. Refer to Chapter 5 to refresh yourself on what you can do at a BIOS level to protect your computer.

Figure 27-4  BIOS/UEFI access password request

Hardware Authentication  Gates, doors, and computers can make use of badge readers, smart card readers, and biometric scanners to authenticate users with more authority than mere passwords. Smart cards are credit card--sized cards with circuitry that can identify the bearer of the card. Smart cards are relatively common for tasks such as authenticating users for mass transit systems but are fairly uncommon in computers. Figure 27-5 shows a smart card and keyboard combination.

Figure 27-5  Keyboard-mounted smart card reader being used for a commercial application (photo courtesy of Cherry Corp.)

Security tokens are devices that store some unique information that the user carries on their person. They may be digital certificates, passwords, or biometric data. They may also store an RSA token. RSA tokens are random-number generators that are used with usernames and passwords to ensure extra security. Most security hard tokens come in the form of key fobs, as shown in Figure 27-6.

Figure 27-6  RSA key fob (photo courtesy of EMC Corp.)

Apps and services that use security codes usually prompt you to enter the code after you supply your username and password. Some offer to send you a code via e-mail, text message (via short message service [SMS]), or voice call. Figure 27-7 shows PayPal prompting me for a code from my authenticator app (left) and my bank offering to send me a security code (right).

Figure 27-7  Prompt for a security code (left) and offer to send a security code (right)

An authenticator application is a software security token (a soft token) that turns a mobile device into a security token. As shown in Figure 27-8, these apps can generate a security code like the one on the RSA key fob shown previously in Figure 27-6. Hardware tokens are more secure than soft tokens and send-a-code options.

Figure 27-8  Getting a security code from my authenticator app

People can guess or discover passwords, but it's a lot harder to forge someone's fingerprints. The Apple keyboard shown in Figure 27-9 authenticates users on a local machine by using a fingerprint scanner. Other devices that will do the trick are key fobs, retina scanners, and palmprint scanners. Devices that require some sort of physical, flesh-and-blood authentication are called biometric scanners or biometric locks. In some rare cases, an organization may decide that fingerprints just aren't enough authentication. In these cases, you may find the much newer palmprint reader. Palmprint is a bit of a misnomer, as what the scanner is actually doing is using infrared light to map the unique structure of veins in your palm. Advantages of a palmprint reader include being much more difficult, if not impossible, to fake, and the fact that it requires a person to have blood flow, which is a built-in guarantee that the person being authenticated is alive. The main disadvantage is cost, with palmprint readers often costing significantly more than their fingerprint scanning counterparts.

Figure 27-9  Apple TouchID fingerprint reader on a MacBook Air

Clever manufacturers have developed key fobs and smart cards that use RFID to transmit authentication information so users don't have to insert something into a computer or card reader. The Privaris plusID combines, for example, a biometric fingerprint fob with an RFID tag that makes security as easy as opening a garage door remotely!

Retina scanners loom large in media as a form of biometric security, where you place your eye up to a scanning device. While retina scanners do exist, I have been in hundreds of high-security facilities and have only seen one retina scanner in operation in almost 30 years as a tech. Figure 27-10 shows about the only image of a retina scanner in operation you'll ever encounter.

Figure 27-10  Retina scanner in Half-Life 2

Current smartphones and tablets use full facial recognition for identification and authentication, although they also use passcodes for when the recognition fails. Figure 27-11 shows a user logging in to an Apple iPhone via facial recognition. (Note the open lock. Hard to show the process in action because it happens so fast!)

Figure 27-11  Unlocking an iPhone via facial recognition

Users and Groups

Windows uses user accounts and groups as the bedrock of access control. A user account is assigned to a group, such as Users, Power Users, or Administrators, and by association gets certain permissions on the computer. Using NTFS enables the highest level of control over data resources.

Assigning users to groups is a great first step in controlling a local machine, but this feature really shines in a networked environment. Let's take a look.

NOTE   The file system on a hard drive matters a lot when it comes to security. On modern systems, the file system on the boot drive has support for an access control list (ACL), a rich form of user and groups permissions. But this security only extends to drives/cards formatted with modern file systems such as NTFS, APFS, HFS+, and ext3/4. If you copy a file to a drive/card formatted with exFAT or the older FAT32, such as many cameras and USB flash drives use, the OS will strip all permissions and the file will be available for anyone to read!

Access to user accounts should be restricted to the assigned individuals, and those who configure the permissions to those accounts must follow the principle of least privilege: accounts should have permission to access only the resources they need and no more. Tight control of user accounts is critical to preventing unauthorized access. Disabling unused accounts is an important part of this strategy, but good user account management goes far deeper than that.

Groups are a great way to achieve increased complexity without increasing the administrative burden on network administrators, because all operating systems combine permissions. When a user is a member of more than one group, which permissions does that user have with respect to any particular resource? In all operating systems, the permissions of the groups are combined, and the result is what you call the effective permissions the user has to access a resource. As an example, if Rita is a member of the Sales group, which has List Folder Contents permission to a folder, and she is also a member of the Managers group, which has Read and Execute permissions to the same folder, Rita will have both List Folder Contents and Read and Execute permissions to that folder.

Watch out for default user accounts and groups---they can become secret backdoors to your network! All network operating systems have a default Everyone group that can be used to sneak into shared resources easily. This Everyone group, as its name implies, literally includes anyone who connects to that resource. Windows gives full control to the Everyone group by default, for example, so make sure you know to lock this down! The other scary one is the Guest account. The Guest account is the only way to access a system without a username and password. Unless you have a compelling reason to provide guest access, you should always make sure the Guest account is disabled.

All of the default groups---Everyone, Guest, Users---define broad groups of users. Never use them unless you intend to permit all of those folks access to a resource. If you use one of the default groups, remember to configure it with the proper permissions to prevent users from doing things you don't want them to do with a shared resource!

NOTE   You can use directory permissions to limit access to sensitive information on a shared file server, protect user-specific files from snooping by other users on a multiuser system, and protect the system's own software from being compromised by any scripts or programs the user runs. The job doesn't end here, though! Anyone with physical access to a drive can ignore your controls. Use full-disk data-at-rest encryption to protect data (data in storage, not in use or moving around the network).

Security Policies

We've already discussed policies in Chapters 13 and 19, but let's do a quick review and then see how we put it all together to help secure a network. Although permissions control how users access shared resources, there are other functions you should control that are outside the scope of resources. For example, do you want users to be able to access a command prompt on their Windows system? Do you want users to be able to install software? Would you like to control what systems a user can log on to or at what time of day a user can log on? All network operating systems provide you with some capability to control these and literally hundreds of other security parameters, under what Windows calls policies. I like to think of policies as permissions for activities, as opposed to true permissions, which control access to resources.

A policy is usually applied to a user account, a computer, or a group. Let's use the example of a network composed of Windows systems with a Windows Server. Every Windows client has its own local policies program, which enables policies to be placed on that system only. Figure 27-12 shows the tool you use to set local policies on an individual system, called Local Security Policy, being used to deny the Guest account the capability to log on locally.

Figure 27-12  Local Security Policy

Local policies work great for individual systems, but they can be a pain to configure if you want to apply the same settings to more than one PC on your network. If you want to apply policy settings en masse, you need to step up to features of domain-based Windows Active Directory. You can use organizational units (OUs) that organize users and devices logically into a folder-like hierarchy; then exercise deity-like (Microsoft prefers the term granular) control to apply a different group policy to the network clients in each unit.

One important thing to keep in mind about Active Directory group policies is that they supersede local policies. For example, if you have a local policy in place that allows a specific user to install third-party software, then set a group policy for the domain that prevents all users from doing so, the user won't be able to install the software. If you run into a situation like this, you'll find that the gpupdate and gpresult commands we discussed back in Chapter 15 are helpful. They're a quick way to double-check which group policies are applied to which users and make changes if there's a conflict. Now let me explain group policy a little more and show you some examples of what it can do.

EXAM TIP   Group policy changes may not immediately apply to all systems. Windows will fetch the group policy when the system boots or someone logs in. It will also refresh the policy from time to time while running, though some policy changes won't apply without a reboot anyways. You can run gpupdate/force from the command line to update group policy for a specific computer immediately.

Want to set the default wallpaper for every PC in your domain? Group policy can do that. Want to make certain tools inaccessible to everyone but authorized users? Group policy can do that, too. Want to control access to the Internet, redirect home folders, run scripts, deploy software, or just remind folks that unauthorized access to the network will get them nowhere fast? Group policy is the answer. Figure 27-13 shows group policy; I'm about to change the default title on every instance of Internet Explorer on every computer in my domain!

Figure 27-13  Using group policy to make IE title say "Provided by Mike!"

That's just one simple example of the settings you can configure by using group policy. You can apply literally hundreds of tweaks through group policy, from the great to the small, but don't worry too much about familiarizing yourself with each and every one. Group policy settings are a big topic on most of the Microsoft certification tracks, but for the purposes of the CompTIA A+ exams, you simply have to be comfortable with the concept behind group policy.

Although I could never list every possible policy you can enable on a Windows system, here's a list of some commonly used ones:

-   Prevent Registry Edits If you try to edit the Registry, you get a failure message.

-   Prevent Access to the Command Prompt Keeps users from getting to the command prompt by turning off the Run command and the Command Prompt shortcut.

-   Log On Locally Defines who may log on to the system locally.

-   Shut Down System Defines who may shut down the system.

-   Minimum Password Length Forces a minimum password length.

-   Account Lockout Threshold Sets the maximum number of logon attempts a person can make before being locked out of the account.

-   Disable Windows Installer Prevents users from installing software.

-   Printer Browsing Enables users to browse for printers on the network, as opposed to using only assigned printers.

Although the CompTIA A+ exams don't expect you to know how to implement policies on any type of network, you are expected to understand that policies exist, especially on Windows networks, and that they can do amazing things to control what users can do on their systems. If you ever try to get to a command prompt on a Windows system only to discover the Run command is dimmed, blame it on a policy, not the computer!

EXAM TIP   Account management security policy best practices dictate that you should implement restrictive user permissions, login time restrictions, account lockout based on failed attempts, disable guest accounts, and disable the operating system's built-in AutoRun or AutoPlay features. Finally, you should always change default system usernames and passwords where possible.

Network Security

Networks are under threat from the outside as well, so this section looks at issues involving Internet-borne attacks, firewalls, and wireless networking. This content is the security bread and butter for a CompTIA A+ technician, so you need to understand the concepts and procedures and be able to implement them properly.

Malicious Software

The beauty of the Internet is the ease of accessing resources just about anywhere on the globe, all from the comfort of your favorite chair. This connection, however, runs both ways, and people from all over the world can potentially access your computer from the comfort of their evil lairs. The Internet is awash with malicious software that is, even at this moment, trying to infect your systems.

The term malware defines any program or code that's designed to do something on a system or network that you don't want done. Malware comes in quite a variety of guises, such as viruses, worms, ransomware, spyware, Trojan horses, keyloggers, cryptojacking, and rootkits. Let's examine all these forms of malware, look at what they do to infected systems, and then examine how these nasties get onto your machines in the first place.

Forms of Malware

Malware has been pestering PC users since the 1980s and has evolved into many forms over the years. From the classic boot sector viruses of the '90s to the more recent threats of ransomware and attacks on critical infrastructure, malware is an ever-changing threat to your users and data. To better understand these threats, you need to understand the different forms that malware can take.

Virus  A virus is a program that has two jobs: to replicate and to activate. Replication means it makes copies of itself, by injecting itself as extra code added to the end of executable programs, or by hiding out in a drive's boot sector. Boot sector viruses can be particularly nasty because they live inside your system's boot partition and activate their malicious code before the security software is able to start up and prevent it. Activation is when a virus does something like corrupting data or stealing private information. A virus only replicates to other drives, such as thumb drives or optical media. It does not self-replicate across networks. A virus needs human action to spread.

Worm  A worm functions similarly to a virus, except it does not need to attach itself to other programs to replicate. It can replicate on its own through networks, or even hardware like Thunderbolt accessories. If the infected computer is on a network, a worm will start scanning the network for other vulnerable systems to infect.

Trojan  A Trojan (named for the Trojan Horse) is a piece of malware that appears or pretends to do one thing while, at the same time, it does something evil. A Trojan horse may be a game, like poker, or ironically, a fake security program. The sky is the limit. Once installed, a Trojan horse can have a hold on the system as tenacious as any virus or worm; a key difference is that installed Trojan horses do not replicate.

Keylogger  Keylogger malware does pretty much what you might imagine, recording the user's keystrokes and making that information available to the programmer. You'll find keylogging functions as part of other malware as well. Keyloggers are not solely evil; a lot of parental control tools use keyloggers.

Rootkit  For malware to succeed, it often needs to come up with some method to hide itself. As awareness of malware has grown, anti-malware programs make it harder to find new locations on a computer to hide malware. A rootkit is a program that takes advantage of very low-level operating system functions to hide itself from all but the most aggressive of anti-malware tools. Worse, a rootkit, by definition, gains privileged access to the computer. Rootkits can strike operating systems, hypervisors, and even firmware (including hard drives and accessories . . . yikes!).

The most infamous rootkit appeared a while back as an antipiracy attempt by Sony on its music CDs. Unfortunately for the media giant, the rootkit software installed when you played a music CD and opened a backdoor that could be used maliciously.

Cryptominers  Malicious actors are often motivated by financial gain, so sometimes, they try to kill two birds with one stone by installing malware that can mine cryptocurrency. These cryptominers take control of a computer's hardware resources and use them to mine cryptocurrency, which is then deposited into a crypto wallet belonging to the attacker. A telltale sign a system is infected with this kind of malware may be inexplicably high GPU or CPU utilization. There are other problems that can lead to excessive hardware utilization, but if you see it, it might be a good idea to check for cryptominer malware.

Behavior

Knowing what form the malware takes is all well and good, but what really matters is how "mal" the malware will be when it's running rampant on a system. To get things started, let's dive into an old favorite: spyware.

Spyware  Spyware---malicious software, generally installed without your knowledge---can use your computer's resources to run distributed computing applications, capture keystrokes to steal passwords, or worse. Classic spyware often sneaks onto systems by being bundled with legitimate software---software that functions correctly and provides some form of benefit to the user. What kind of benefit? Way back in 2005, Movieland (otherwise known as Movieland.com and Popcorn.net) released a "handy" movie download service. They didn't tell users, of course, that everyone who installed the software was "automatically enrolled" in a three-day trial. If you didn't cancel the "trial," a pop-up window filled your screen demanding you pay them for the service that you never signed up for. The worst part, however, was that you couldn't uninstall the application completely. The uninstaller redirected users to a Web page demanding money again. (Movieland was shut down in 2007.)

For another classic example, look at Figure 27-14: the dialog box asks the user if she trusts the Gator Corporation (a well-known spyware producer from ages ago). Because everyone eventually knew not to trust Gator, they would click No, and the company faded away.

Figure 27-14  Classic Gator Corporation's acknowledgment warning

If Movieland was a problem back in 2005, what are the big spyware applications today? Unfortunately, I can't tell you---not because it's a secret, but because we don't know about them yet. You'll probably only run into spyware these days on the CompTIA A+ 1102 exam.

Ransomware  As bad as spyware can be, at least you still have access to your data. Ransomware, on the other hand, encrypts all the data it can gain access to on a system. To top it off, many versions of ransomware can even encrypt data on mapped network drives!

EXAM TIP   Know the various types of malware, including viruses, worms, Trojan horses, keyloggers, rootkits, cryptominers, spyware, and ransomware.

Once it has locked up all your data, the ransomware application pops up a message asking for money (often bitcoins) to decrypt your data (see Figure 27-15). Also, to encourage a faster payment, this ransom is presented with a timer that, when it reaches 0, triggers deletion of the encryption keys, leaving you with a drive full of scrambled data. In some particularly dastardly cases, the ransomware doesn't actually have the ability to decrypt built in, and will just leave your drives encrypted or wipe the data altogether when that clock hits 0.

Figure 27-15  Clean computer (top) and same computer (bottom) encrypted by Black Basta group malware (Courtesy of National Cyber Labs)

A Bot on the Net Full of Zombies  Another type of malware I want to talk about is the botnet ("bot" as in robot, get it!). As we touched on when we discussed Denial of Service attacks, a botnet, as "net" in its name implies, isn't a single type of malware, but rather, a network of infected computers (zombies) under the control of a single person or group. Botnets can be massive, easily growing into the millions of zombies for the largest networks.

With that many machines under their control, botnet operators have command of massive computing and network resources. Some of the most common uses of botnets are sending spam or launching distributed denial of service attacks. If you've ever wondered how spammers and hackers pay for all that bandwidth, they don't! They use the bandwidth of millions of zombie machines spread all around the world, from grandma's e-mail machine to hacked Web servers.

Spam is but one use of a botnet. The criminals who run these networks also use all that collective power to launch a DDoS attack against companies and governments and demand a ransom to call off the attack.

Malware Signs and Symptoms

If your PC has been infected by malware, you'll bump into some strange things before you can even run an anti-malware scan. Like a medical condition, malware causes unusual symptoms that should stand out from your everyday computer use. You need to become a PC physician and understand what each of these symptoms means.

Malware's biggest strength is its flexibility: it can look like anything. In fact, a lot of malware attacks can feel like normal PC "wonkiness"---momentary slowdowns, random one-time crashes, and so on. Knowing when a weird application crash is actually a malware attack is half the battle.

Slow performance in a PC can mean you're running too many applications at once, or that you've been hit with malware. Applications can crash at random, even if you don't have too many loaded. How do you tell the difference? In this case, it's the frequency. If it's happening a lot, even when all of your applications are closed, you've got a problem. This goes for frequent lockups, too---whether it seems to be PC- or OS-based lockups. If Windows starts misbehaving (more than usual), run your anti-malware application right away.

Malware, however, doesn't always jump out at you with big system crashes. Some malware tries to rename system files, change file permissions, or hide files completely. You might start getting e-mail messages from colleagues or friends questioning a message "you" sent to them that seemed spammy. You might get automated replies from unknown sent e-mail that you know you didn't send. An increase in desktop alerts that don't seem to have a legitimate cause, or unwanted notifications within the OS may also be signs that it's time to check for malware. You may even get false alerts regarding your computer's antivirus protection. Most of these issues are easily caught by a regular anti-malware scan, so as long as you remain vigilant, you'll be okay.

NOTE   While it's not necessarily a malware attack, watch out for hijacked e-mail accounts belonging either to you or to someone you know. Hackers can hit both e-mail clients and Webmail users. If you start receiving some fishy (or phishy) e-mail messages, change your Webmail username and password and scan your PC for malware.

Some malware even fights back, defending itself from your many attempts to remove it. If your Windows Update feature stops working, preventing you from patching your PC, you've got malware. (CompTIA speak: OS update failures.) If other tools and utilities throw up an "Access Denied" road block, you've got malware. If you lose all Internet connectivity, either the malware is stopping you or the process of removing the malware broke your connection. (CompTIA refers to this as being unable to access the network, which seems very polite.) In this case, you might need to reconfigure your Internet connection: reinstall your NIC and its drivers, reboot your router, and so on.

Even your browser and anti-malware applications can turn against you. If you type in one Web address and end up at a different site than you anticipated, this is known as a browser redirection and it means that a malware infection might have overwritten your hosts file. The hosts file overrules any DNS settings and can redirect your browser to whatever site the malware adds to the file. Most browser redirections point you to phishing scams or Web sites full of free downloads (that are, of course, covered in even more malware). In fact, some free anti-malware applications are actually malware---what techs call rogue anti-malware programs. You can avoid these rogue applications by sticking to the recommended lists of anti-malware software found online at reputable tech sites, like Ars Technica, Tom's Hardware, Anandtech, and others. Random/frequent pop-ups can be another annoying sign that your system is infected with some form of malware. Pop-up blocking has become fairly effective over the years, so if you've already ruled out the possibility that the browser isn't up to date or that the pop-up blocker is off, it may be time to start looking for malware.

Watch for security alerts in Windows, either from Windows' built-in security tools or from your third-party anti-malware program. Windows built-in tools alert you via the Action Center or the Windows Defender Security Center (Windows 10/11). The notification in Figure 27-16 is prompting us to activate Defender Antivirus. You don't configure much here; it just tells you whether or not you are protected. The Action Center or Security Center will pop up a notification in the notification area whenever Windows detects a problem.

Figure 27-16  Notification to activate Defender Antivirus in Windows 11

Malware Prevention and Recovery

The only way to permanently protect your PC from malware is to disconnect it from the Internet and never permit any potentially infected software to touch your precious computer. Because neither scenario is likely these days, you need to use specialized anti-malware programs to help stave off the inevitable assaults. Even with the best anti-malware tools, there are times when malware still manages to strike your computer. When you discover infected systems, you need to know how to stop the spread of the malware to other computers, how to fix infected computers, and how to remediate (restore) the system as close to its original state as possible.

Dealing with Malware

You can deal with malware in several ways: anti-malware programs, training and awareness, patch/update management, and remediation.

At the very least, every computer should run an anti-malware program. If possible, add an appliance that runs anti-malware programs against incoming data from your network. Also remember that an anti-malware program is only as good as its updates---keep everyone's definition file (explained a bit later) up to date with, literally, nightly updates! Users must be trained to look for suspicious ads, programs, and pop-ups, and understand that they must not click these things. The more you teach users about malware, the more aware they'll be of potential threats. Your organization should have policies and procedures in place so everyone knows what to do if they encounter malware. Finally, a good tech maintains proper incident response records to see if any pattern to attacks emerges. He or she can then adjust policies and procedures to mitigate these attacks.

NOTE   One of the most important malware mitigation procedures is to keep systems under your control patched and up to date through proper patch management. Microsoft, Apple, and the Linux maintainers do a very good job of putting out bug fixes and patches as soon as problems occur. If your systems aren't set up to update automatically, then perform manual updates regularly.

Anti-Malware Programs

An anti-malware program such as a classic antivirus program protects your PC in two ways. It can be both sword and shield, working in an active seek-and-destroy mode and in a passive sentry mode. When ordered to seek and destroy, the program scans the computer's boot sector and files for viruses and, if it finds any, presents you with the available options for removing or disabling them. Antivirus programs can also operate as virus shields that passively monitor a computer's activity, checking for viruses only when certain events occur, such as a program execution or file download.

NOTE   The term antivirus (and antispyware, or anti-anything) is becoming obsolete. Viruses are only a small component of the many types of malware. Many people continue to use the term as a synonym for anti-malware.

Antivirus programs use different techniques to combat different types of viruses. They detect boot sector viruses simply by comparing the drive's boot sector to a standard boot sector. This works because most boot sectors are basically the same. Some antivirus programs make a backup copy of the boot sector. If they detect a virus, the programs use that backup copy to replace the infected boot sector. Executable viruses are a little more difficult to find because they can be on any file in the drive. To detect executable viruses, the antivirus program uses a library of signatures. A signature is the code pattern of a known virus. The antivirus program compares an executable file to its library of signatures. There have been instances where a perfectly clean program coincidentally held a virus signature. Usually, the antivirus program's creator provides a patch to prevent further alarms.

Windows comes with Windows Defender (simply called Virus & threat protection in Windows 10/11, as shown in Figure 27-17), a fine tool for catching most malware, but it's not perfect. You can also supplement Windows Defender with a second malware removal program. My personal favorite is Malwarebytes.

Figure 27-17  Windows 11 Virus & threat protection

These applications work exactly as advertised. They detect and delete malware of all sorts---hidden files and folders, cookies, Registry keys and values, you name it. Malwarebytes is free for personal use. Figure 27-18 shows Malwarebytes in action.

Now that you understand the types of viruses and how antivirus programs try to protect against them, let's review a few terms that are often used to describe virus traits.

SIM   Check out the excellent Challenge! sim, "Fixing Viruses," in the Chapter 27 sims over at https://www.totalsem.com/110X.

Polymorphic/Polymorphs  A polymorphic virus, often shortened to a polymorph, attempts to change its signature to prevent detection by antivirus programs, usually by continually scrambling a bit of useless code. Fortunately, the scrambling code itself can be identified and used as the signature---once the antivirus makers become aware of the virus. One technique used to combat unknown polymorphs is to have the antivirus program create a checksum on every file in the drive. A checksum in this context is a number generated by the software based on the contents of the file rather than the name, date, or size of that file. The algorithms for creating these checksums vary among different antivirus programs (they are also usually kept secret to help prevent virus makers from coming up with ways to beat them). Every time a program is run, the antivirus program calculates a new checksum and compares it with the earlier calculation. If the checksums are different, it is a sure sign of a virus.

Stealth  The term "stealth" is more of a concept than an actual virus function. Most stealth virus programs are boot sector viruses that use various methods to hide from antivirus software. The AntiEXE stealth virus hooks on to a little-known but often-used software interrupt, for example, running only when that interrupt runs. Others make copies of innocent-looking files.

User Education Regarding Common Threats

A powerful tool to prevent malware attacks and to reduce the impact of malware attacks when they happen is to educate your end users. Teach users to be cautious of incoming e-mail they don't clearly recognize and to never click on an attachment or URL in an e-mail unless they are 100 percent certain of the source. With the rise in ransomware attacks over time, good anti-phishing training has become an absolutely essential tool in the IT security toolbox. Anti-phishing training involves teaching users how to recognize and critically examine incoming e-mails to better avoid falling prey to phishing attempts. Anti-phishing training has benefits that extend beyond the confines of the organization, as phishing attacks happen in SOHO environments as well. Regardless of where or why a person is using their device, this is some very useful education.

Explain the dangers of going to questionable Web sites to your users and teach them how to react when they see questionable actions take place. All Web browsers have built-in attack site warnings like the one shown in Figure 27-19.

Figure 27-19  Attack site warning

Nobody wants their systems infected with malware. Users are motivated and happy when you give them the skills necessary to protect themselves. The bottom line is that educated and aware users will make your life a lot easier.

Malware Prevention Tips

The secret to preventing damage from a malicious software attack is to keep from getting malware on your system in the first place. One way to do this is with a variation on traditional DNS---secure DNS. Secure DNS can describe software or a remote DNS provider that implements some additional filtering to block your devices from visiting all kinds of malicious Web sites.

If you can't keep the malware from reaching your system, a good next step is catching it on the way in the door. All good antivirus/anti-malware programs (like the built-in Windows Defender Antivirus) include a virus shield that scans e-mail, downloads, running programs, and so on automatically (see Figure 27-20).

Figure 27-20  A Windows 10 virus shield (Defender Antivirus) in action

Use your antivirus shield. It is also a good idea to scan PCs daily for possible virus attacks. Last but not least, know the source of any software before you load it. Only install apps from trusted sources, such as the manufacturer's Web site, or well-known app stores like Valve's Steam service. Avoid untrusted software sources, like free registry cleaners from some support domain, at all costs.

Keep your antivirus and anti-malware programs (including Defender Antivirus) updated. New viruses and other malware appear daily, and your programs need to know about them. The list of virus signatures your antivirus program can recognize, for example, is called the definition file, and updated definitions play a critical role in keeping the latest malware out of your system. Fortunately, most antivirus programs update themselves automatically. Further, you should periodically update the core anti-malware software programming---called the engine---to employ the latest refinements the developers have included.

Boot Media Anti-Malware Tools

If you run anti-malware software and your computer still gets infected, especially after a reboot, you need a more serious anti-malware tool. Many anti-malware companies provide a bootable optical disc or USB flash drive (or show you how to make one) that enables you to boot from a known-clean OS and run the same anti-malware software, but this time not corrupted by the malware on your system.

Malware Recovery Tips

When the inevitable happens and either your computer or one of your user's computers gets infected by malware such as a computer virus, you need to follow certain steps to stop the problem from spreading and get the computer back up safely into service. The CompTIA A+ 1102 exam outlines the following multistep process as the best practice procedures for malware removal:

1\.   Investigate and verify malware symptoms.

2\.   Quarantine infected systems.

3\.   Disable System Restore in Windows.

4\.   Remediate infected systems.

A.   Update anti-malware software.

B.   Scanning and removal techniques (e.g., Safe Mode, Preinstallation Environment).

5\.   Schedule scans and run updates.

6\.   Enable System Restore and create a restore point in Windows.

7\.   Educate the end user.

EXAM TIP   In addition to this malware removal process, the CompTIA A+ 1102 objectives also mention OS reinstallation as another way to make sure your system is malware-free---just restore a full system backup (in Windows, you can take or restore one with the Backup and Restore utility). There are hurdles to using this approach.

You must have space to store one or more full backups, plan far enough ahead to have one or more recent backup available, know at least one is malware-free, and be prepared to either back up user files/data separately or lose any created/modified since the last backup. You won't always have this option, but a good way to get started is to back up user files and data separately and take a full backup of the system itself once you have all of the software you need installed and configured. If you attempt to reinstall your OS from a backup and you find that your system is still infected, it may be time to try what is known as a clean install, which means just starting from a fresh copy of Windows and treating it like a new device. This has disadvantages as well, since it means starting from scratch with your system's apps and data. In some cases, this may be your only choice, but it isn't always ideal.

Recognize and Quarantine  The first step is to identify and recognize that a potential malware outbreak has occurred. If you're monitoring network traffic and one computer starts spewing e-mail, that's a good indicator of malware. Or users might complain that a computer that was running snappily the day before seems very sluggish.

Many networks employ software such as the open source PacketFence that automatically monitors network traffic and can cut a machine off the network if that machine starts sending suspicious packets. You can also quarantine a computer manually by disconnecting the network cable. Once you're sure the machine isn't capable of infecting others, you're ready to find the virus or other malware and get rid of it.

At this point, you should disable System Restore. If you make any changes going forward, you don't want the virus to be included in any saved restore points. To turn off System Restore in Windows, open the Control Panel and then the System applet. Click the System protection link to open the System Properties window with the System Protection tab displayed. In the Protection Settings section, select a drive and click Configure. In the System Protection dialog box that opens, select Turn off system protection. Repeat the procedure for each hard drive on the system.

Search and Destroy  Once you've isolated the infected computer (or computers), you need to get to a safe boot environment and run anti-malware software. You can try the Windows Recovery Environment in Windows 10/11, because it doesn't require anything but a reboot. If that doesn't work, or you suspect a boot sector virus, you need to turn to an external bootable source, such as a bootable optical disc or USB flash drive.

Get into the habit of keeping around a bootable anti-malware flash drive or optical media. If you suspect a virus or other malware, use the boot media, even if your anti-malware program claims to have eliminated the problem. Turn off the PC and reboot it from the anti-malware disc or flash drive (you might have to change CMOS settings to boot to optical or USB media). This will put you in a clean boot environment that you know is free from any boot sector viruses. If you only support fairly recent computers, you will likely be booting to a USB flash drive, so you can put a boot environment on a thumb drive for even faster start-up speeds.

You have several options for creating the bootable optical disc or flash drive. First, some antivirus software comes in a bootable version. Second, you can download a copy of Linux that offers a live USB or DVD option such as Ubuntu. With a live bootable device, you boot to the device and install a complete working copy of the operating system into RAM, never touching or accessing the hard drive, to give you full Internet-ready access so you can reach the many online anti-malware sites you'll need for access to anti-malware tools.

Finally, you can download and burn a copy of the Ultimate Boot CD. Don't worry, you can use it with a USB drive. It comes stocked with several antivirus and anti-malware programs, so you won't need any other tool. Find it at https://www.ultimatebootcd.com. The only downside is that the anti-malware engines will quickly be out of date, as will their malware libraries.

Once you get to a boot environment, update your anti-malware software and then run its most comprehensive scan. Then check all removable media that were exposed to the system, and any other machine that might have received data from the system or that is networked to the cleaned machine. A virus or other malicious program can often lie dormant for months before anyone knows of its presence.

E-mail is still a common source of viruses, and opening infected e-mails is a common way to get infected. Viewing an e-mail in a preview window opens the e-mail message and exposes your computer to some viruses. Download files only from sites you know to be safe and avoid the less reputable corners of the Internet, the most likely places to pick up computer infections.

EXAM TIP   CompTIA considers the process of removing a virus part of the remediation step. Since you can't remediate a PC until after a virus is gone, I've laid out the steps as you see here.

Remediate  Malware infections can do a lot of damage to a system, especially to sensitive files needed to load Windows, so you might need to remediate formerly infected systems after cleaning off the drive or drives. Remediation simply means that you fix things the virus or other malware harmed. This can mean replacing corrupted Windows Registry files or even startup files.

If you can't start Windows after the malware scan is finished, you need to boot to the Windows Preinstallation Environment and use the Windows Recovery Environment/System Recovery Options.

With the Windows Recovery Environment (covered in detail in Chapter 16), you have access to more repair tools, such as Startup Repair, System Restore, System Image Recovery, Refresh, and Command Prompt (see Figure 27-21). Run the appropriate option for the situation and you should have the machine properly remediated in a jiffy.

Figure 27-21  System Recovery Options

EXAM TIP   Remember to re-enable System Restore and create a new restore point once the system has been repaired. Be aware that you may see recovery environment referred to as recovery mode on the exam, so don't let that throw you off.

Educate End Users  The best way to keep from having to deal with malware is education. It's your job as the IT person to talk to your users, especially the ones whose systems you've just spent an hour ridding of nasties, about how to avoid these programs. Show them samples of dangerous e-mails they should not open, Web sites to avoid, and the types of programs they should not install and use on the network. Any user who understands the risks of questionable actions on their computers will usually do the right thing and stay away from malware.

Finally, have your users run antivirus and antispyware programs regularly. Schedule them while interfacing with the user so you know it will happen.

1101

Firewalls

Much as anti-malware programs are essential tools in the fight against malicious programs on the Internet, firewalls are devices or software that protect an internal network from unauthorized access to and from the Internet at large. Firewalls use a number of methods to protect networks, such as hiding IP addresses and blocking TCP/IP ports.

A typical network uses one of two types of firewalls: hardware firewalls, often built into routers, and software firewalls that run on your computers. Both types of firewall protect your computer and your network. You also run them at the same time. Let's look at both a typical SOHO router's firewall features and your computer's software firewall to see how they protect your network and your computers.

Hardware Firewall Settings

Most SOHO networks use a hardware firewall, often as a feature built into a router like the ASUS model shown in Figure 27-22. A hardware firewall protects a LAN from outside threats by filtering the packets before they reach your internal machines, which you learned about back in Chapter 21. Routers, however, have a few other tricks up their sleeves. From the router's browser-based settings screen (see Figure 27-23), you can configure a hardware firewall. Let's walk through a few of the available settings.

Figure 27-22  ASUS router as a firewall

Figure 27-23  Default Web interface

A hardware firewall watches for and stops many common threats---all you have to do is turn it on (see Figure 27-24). Hardware firewalls use Stateful Packet Inspection (SPI) to inspect each incoming packet individually. SPI also blocks any incoming traffic that isn't in response to your outgoing traffic. You can even disable unused ports entirely, blocking all traffic in or out. But what if you want to allow outside users access to a Web server on the LAN? Because Network Address Translation (NAT) hides the true IP address of that system (as described in Chapter 21), you'll need a way to allow incoming traffic past the router/firewall and a way to redirect that traffic to the right PC.

Figure 27-24  SPI firewall settings with firewalls enabled

Port forwarding/mapping enables you to open a port in the firewall and direct incoming traffic on that port to a specific IP address on your LAN. In the case of the Web server referenced in the previous paragraph, you would open port 80 (for HTTP packets) and instruct the router to send all incoming traffic to the server machine. Figure 27-25 shows port forwarding configured to send all HTTP packets to an internal Web server.

Figure 27-25  Port forwarding

Port forwarding isn't the only way to open ports on a firewall. Port triggering enables you to open an incoming connection to one computer automatically based on a specific outgoing connection. The trigger port defines the outgoing connection, and the destination port defines the incoming connection. If you set the trigger port to 3434 and the destination port to 1234, for example, any outgoing traffic on port 3434 will trigger the router to open port 1234 and send any received data back to the system that sent the original outgoing traffic. Figure 27-26 shows a router set up with port triggering for an Internet Relay Chat (IRC) server.

Figure 27-26  Port triggering

If you want to go beyond port forwarding and port triggering and open every port on a machine, you need a screened subnet. A screened subnet puts systems with the specified IP addresses outside the protection of the firewall, opening all ports and enabling all incoming traffic (see Figure 27-27). If you think this sounds incredibly dangerous, you are right! Any PC inside the screened subnet will be completely exposed to outside attacks. Don't use it!

Figure 27-27  Screened subnet (DMZ) set up on a SOHO router

EXAM TIP   CompTIA uses the term screened subnet in the A+ 1102 exam objectives, so be ready in case you see it on the exam, but on the job, you'll more likely encounter the term demilitarized zone or DMZ (as shown in Figure 27-27).

Software Firewalls

While a hardware firewall does a lot to protect you from outside intruders, you should also use a software firewall, such as the firewalls built into each version of Windows, called (appropriately) Windows Defender Firewall or Windows Defender Firewall with Advanced Security. (Earlier versions of Windows just called the tool(s) Windows Firewall.) Windows Defender Firewall (see Figure 27-28) handles the heavy lifting of port blocking, security logging, and more.

Figure 27-28  Windows 10 Firewall settings

You can configure Windows Defender Firewall via the Windows Defender Firewall applet in Control Panel. Here you can fine-tune port security by setting up exceptions to open individual ports, or adjust application security by adding exceptions to let specific programs and services pass through the firewall. If you wanted to run a Minecraft server (a game that requires an Internet connection), for example, it would need to be on the list of exceptions for your firewall. Most programs you install add themselves to this list automatically, otherwise Windows Defender Firewall prompts you the first time you run it and asks if you want to add the program as an exception.

EXAM TIP   You can also manage Windows Defender Firewall through the Windows Security app. To activate or deactivate the firewall, visit the Firewall & network protection section. To activate, click the Turn on button under each network type you use. To deactivate, click the network name and then toggle Defender Firewall off.

When Microsoft first introduced Windows Firewall, way back in Windows XP, its biggest shortcoming was that it failed to consider that a single PC, especially a portable, might connect to multiple networks. You don't necessarily want the same firewall settings used for both public and private networks. Microsoft developed a way for you to separate trustworthy networks (like the one in your house or at the office) from non-trustworthy networks (like a public Wi-Fi Internet connection at the airport) by including three network types: Domain, Private, and Guest or Public.

-   A Domain network is a Windows network controlled by a Windows domain controller that runs Active Directory Domain Services. In this case, the domain controller itself tells your machine what it can and cannot share. You don't need to do anything when your computer joins a domain.

-   A Private network enables you to share resources, discover other devices, and allow other devices to discover your computer safely.

-   A Guest or Public network prevents your computer from sharing and disables all discovery protocols.

When your computer connects to a network for the first time, Windows will prompt you to choose the network type. Windows 10/11 asks if you want to allow other devices on the network to discover your PC (see Figure 27-29). It will mark the network Private if you answer yes; Public if you answer no. In either case, Windows uses your answer to decide whether to share files and resources or lock them down tight.

Figure 27-29  Windows 10 network options, public or private?

When your computer joins a domain, Windows automatically sets your network location to Domain (unless your domain controller chooses something different, which is unlikely).

When running on a Private (Home or Work) network, Windows enables Network Discovery and File and Printer Sharing as exceptions. When running on a Guest or Public network, Windows disables these exceptions.

EXAM TIP   The Network Discovery setting dictates whether a computer can find other computers or devices on a network, and vice versa. Even with Network Discovery activated, several firewall settings can overrule certain connections.

That's the end of the story if your Windows machine never changes networks, but what about machines (mainly laptops) that hop from one network to another (see Figure 27-30)? In that case, you need different firewall settings for each network the system might encounter.

Figure 27-30  Many machines need more than one network setting.

EXAM TIP   Expect a scenario question on home vs. work vs. public network options on the CompTIA A+ 1102 exam. Just remember that you trust home and work networks, but don't trust public ones.

Once you've picked a network type, you might want to customize the firewall settings further. If you click the Advanced settings option in the Windows Defender Firewall applet, you'll discover a much deeper level of firewall configuration. In fact, it's an entirely different tool called Windows Defender Firewall with Advanced Security (see Figure 27-31). You can also access it directly through the Administrative Tools in Control Panel.

Figure 27-31  Windows Defender Firewall with Advanced Security

From the Windows Defender Firewall with Advanced Security snap-in, you have much more control over how Windows treats exceptions. In the standard Windows Defender Firewall applet, you can only choose a program and make it an exception, giving it permission to pass through the firewall. But programs both send and receive network data, and the basic applet doesn't give you much control over the "inbound" and "outbound" aspect of firewalls. The Windows Defender Firewall with Advanced Security snap-in takes the exceptions concept and expands it to include custom rules for both inbound and outbound data. Figure 27-32 shows the outbound rules for a typical Windows system.

Figure 27-32  Outbound Rules list

A rule always includes at least the following:

-   The name of the program

-   Group: an organizational group that helps sort all the rules

-   The associated profile (All, Domain, Public, Private)

-   Enabled/disabled status

-   Remote and local address

-   Remote and local port number

You can add, remove, and customize any rule to your liking. It quickly gets complicated, so unless you need to set a lot of custom rules, stick to the standard Windows Defender Firewall applet.

Internet Appliances

The discussion of firewalls barely scratches the surface of tools used to secure a large network. While enterprise networking is generally beyond the scope of a CompTIA A+ tech's duties, the CompTIA A+ 1101 objectives cover a few devices critical to modern network security---IDS, IPS, and network taps---plus the concept of unified threat management. Let's take a look.

An intrusion detection system (IDS) is an Internet application that inspects packets, looking for active intrusions. An IDS functions inside the network, watching for threats that a firewall might miss, such as viruses, illegal logon attempts, and other well-known attacks. Plus, because it inspects traffic inside the network, the IDS can discover internal threats, like the activity of a vulnerability scanner smuggled in on a flash drive by a disgruntled worker planning an attack on an internal database server.

An IDS always has some way to let the network administrators know if an attack is taking place: at the very least the attack is logged, but some IDSs offer a pop-up message, an e-mail, or even a text message to an administrator's phone. An IDS can also respond to detected intrusions with action. The IDS can't stop the attack directly, but can request assistance from other devices---like a firewall---that can.

An intrusion prevention system (IPS) is very similar to an IDS, but an IPS sits directly in the flow of network traffic. This active monitoring has a trio of consequences. First, an IPS can stop an attack while it is happening. There's no need to request help from any other devices. Second, the network bandwidth and latency take a hit. Third, if the IPS goes down, the network link might go down too. Depending on the IPS, it can block incoming packets on-the-fly based on IP address, port number, or application type. An IPS might go even further, literally fixing certain packets on-the-fly.

A network tap is a piece of network monitoring hardware (although there are also smaller-scale software options) that sits between devices on the network and copies the traffic between them for later analysis. This comes in handy because, rather than directly interacting with the traffic and potentially interfering with it, a network tap allows the traffic to flow normally. The copied network traffic can then be inspected without the risk of network disruptions. Network taps can also be part of a virtual network, with a lot of additional flexibility in how they are used. Figure 27-33 shows an example of how a network tap might be used.

Figure 27-33  One potential configuration of a network tap

All these network Internet appliances, no matter how advanced and aware they become, are still singular tools in the box used to protect networks. That is why modern dedicated firewall/Internet appliances are built around providing unified threat management (UTM). UTM takes the traditional firewall and packages it with many other security services such as IPS, VPN, load balancing, antivirus, and many other features depending on the make and model. The UTM approach to building network gear helps build robust security deep into the network, protecting what really matters: our data.

1102

Authentication and Encryption

You know that the first step in securing data is authentication, through a username and password. But when you throw in networking, you're suddenly not just a single user sitting in front of a computer and typing. You're accessing a remote resource and sending login information over the Internet. What's to stop someone from intercepting your username and password?

Firewalls do a great job of controlling traffic coming into a network from the Internet and going out of a network to the Internet, but they do nothing to stop interceptor hackers who monitor traffic on the public Internet looking for vulnerabilities. Worse, once a packet is on the Internet itself, anyone with the right equipment can intercept and inspect it. Inspected packets are a cornucopia of passwords, account names, and other tidbits that hackers can use to intrude into your network. Because we can't stop hackers from inspecting these packets, we must turn to encryption to make them unreadable.

Network encryption occurs at many levels and is in no way limited to Internet-based activities. Not only are there many levels of network encryption, but each encryption level also provides multiple standards and options, making encryption one of the most complicated of all networking issues. You need to understand where encryption comes into play, what options are available, and what you can use to protect your network.

Network Authentication

Have you ever considered the process that takes place each time a person types in a username and password to access a network, rather than just a local machine? What happens when this network authentication is requested? If you're thinking that information is sent to a server of some sort to be authenticated, you're right---but do you know how the username and password get to the serving system? That's where encryption becomes important in authentication.

In a local network, authentication and encryption are usually handled by the OS. In today's increasingly interconnected and diverse networking environment, there is a motivation to enable different operating systems to authenticate any client system from any other OS. Modern operating systems such as Windows and macOS use standard authentication encryptions such as MIT's Kerberos, enabling multiple brands of servers to authenticate multiple brands of clients. These LAN authentication methods are usually transparent and work quite nicely, even in mixed networks.

Data Encryption

Encryption methods don't stop at the authentication level. There are a number of ways to encrypt network data as well. The encryption method is dictated to a large degree by what method the communicating systems will connect with. Many networks consist of multiple networks linked together by some sort of private connection, usually some kind of WAN connection such as old T1s or Metro Ethernet. Microsoft's encryption method of choice for this type of network is called IPsec (derived from IP security). IPsec provides transparent encryption between the server and the client.

A virtual private network (VPN) can also use IPsec, but VPNs typically use other encryption methods. Speaking of VPNs, if you're on an untrusted network, you can also protect your network traffic by tunneling it all through a VPN connection. Security-conscious organizations may even require all of their portable devices access the Internet through a VPN connection to one of their home offices.

Application Encryption

When it comes to encryption, even TCP/IP applications can get into the swing of things. The most famous of all application encryptions is the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) security protocol, which was used to secure Web sites. Everyone uses Transport Layer Security (TLS) in HTTPS (HTTP over TLS) protocol these days. (SSL has been replaced by TLS, in other words.) These protocols make it possible to secure the Web sites people use to make purchases over the Internet. You can identify HTTPS Web sites by the https:// (rather than http://) included in the URL (see Figure 27-34).

Figure 27-34  A secure Web site

NOTE   HTTPS originally meant HTTP over SSL, so the "S" in HTTPS made sense. Most Web sites use the more robust TLS to encrypt connections. The Internet people just quietly switched TLS for SSL, but didn't make a new acronym such as "HTTPT." CompTIA refers to the "S" as standing for "secure," which is a great way to remember the main difference between HTTP and HTTPS.

To make a secure connection, your Web browser and the Web server must encrypt their data. That means there must be a way for both the Web server and your browser to encrypt and decrypt each other's data. To do this, the server sends a public key to your Web browser so the browser knows how to decrypt the incoming data. These public keys are sent in the form of a digital certificate. This certificate is signed by a trusted certificate authority (CA) that guarantees that the public key you are about to get is actually from the Web server and not from some evil person trying to pretend to be the Web server. A number of companies issue digital certificates, such as Verisign, Comodo, and many others.

Your Web browser has a built-in list of trusted certificate authorities, referred to as trusted root CAs. If a certificate comes in from a Web site that uses one of these highly respected companies, you won't see anything happen in your browser; you'll just go to the secure Web page, where a small lock icon will appear in the browser status bar or address bar. Figure 27-35 shows the list of trusted certificate authorities built into the Firefox Web browser.

Figure 27-35  Trusted certificate authorities

If you receive a certificate that your browser thinks is fishy, such as one that is expired or one for which the browser does not have a trusted root CA, the browser will warn you and usually give you some way to make an exception for the certificate, as shown in Figure 27-36.

Figure 27-36  Incoming certificate

We all have to make our own decisions here, but you should usually heed the browser's warning and advice. Most certificate warnings are invalid for boring reasons, like the site owner forgetting to update the certificate on time. But the certificate warnings could just as easily indicate that the site or your connection to it is compromised! Only add an exception if you know it's safe. You might, for example, need to add an exception to access a site on your organization's intranet.

Wireless Issues

Wireless networks add a whole level of additional security headaches for techs to face, as you know from Chapter 20. Here are a few points to consider:

-   Set up wireless encryption, at least WPA2 but preferably the more secure WPA3 if your device supports it, and configure clients to use it.

-   Disable DHCP and require your wireless clients to use a static IP address.

-   If you need to use DHCP, only allot enough DHCP addresses to meet the needs of your network, to avoid unused wireless connections.

-   Change the WAP's SSID from the default.

-   Filter by MAC or IP address to help limit network access to known clients only.

-   Change the default username and password. Even if the defaults are generated and look secure, knowledge of how they were generated might make them easier to guess.

-   Update the firmware as needed.

-   If available, make sure the WAP's firewall settings are turned on.

-   Configure SOHO router NAT/DNAT settings.

-   Use SOHO router content filtering/parental controls.

-   Consider physical security of SOHO router.

Chapter 27 Securing Computers

Chapter 28 Operational Procedures

Appendix A Mapping to the CompTIA A+ Objectives

42h 21m remaining

CHAPTER 28

Operational Procedures

In this chapter, you will learn how to

-   Implement best practices associated with documentation and support systems information management

-   Explain basic change-management best practices

-   Summarize environmental impacts and local environmental controls

-   Explain the importance of prohibited content/activity and privacy, licensing, and policy concepts

The term operational procedures encompasses a lot for any organization, from best practices for safety (Chapter 1) to dealing with security risks (Chapter 27); from organizational polices for limiting access to sensitive data (also Chapter 27) to proper communication techniques and professionalism all techs should employ (again, Chapter 1). The CompTIA A+ 1102 exam even throws in basics of scripting (Chapter 15) and remote access technologies (Chapter 21) as operational procedures (though labeling them as such feels like a reach to me).

This chapter explores another aspect of operational procedures---namely, business practices that enable continuity, a fancy way of saying that an organization should keep working more or less the same in the face of both mundane day-to-day change and sudden disasters. We'll focus here on four categories of business continuity and operational procedures: documentation and support systems management, basic change management, environmental impacts and controls, and prohibited content/activity, privacy, licensing, and policies.

1102

Implementing Best Practices Associated with Documentation and Support Systems Information Management

Organizations need documentation to provide continuity and structure. Documentation can take many forms, but the four categories of concern to a new tech are asset management, custom installation of software packages, ticketing systems, and knowledge base/articles.

Asset Management

Techs help organizations institute asset management practices to protect organizational assets. These include inventory lists, database systems, and barcodes, among other things.

EXAM TIP   Although the term "barcode" is not likely to appear on the CompTIA A+ 1102 exam, organizations still use this technology to track assets.

Inventory Lists

Have you ever worked for a company that issued you a piece of equipment that had a company-specific tag on it? This could be anything from a number engraved onto the handle of a shovel to an RFID tag attached to a computer. Regardless of the form, every organization has to track the physical and virtual assets that it has in its inventory at any given time. For a tech company, the inventory might include, for example, 32 Dell laptops, 32 USB-C power adapters, 32 copies of Microsoft Office, and so forth. Regardless of the form, inventory lists are found in every organization and document the assets that the organization has deployed and holds in reserve. Keeping track of these assets is an essential function. Inventory lists document the who, what, and where of each asset so that an organization can track all its assets.

Database System

For now, let's keep this really simple. In the context of asset management, database systems are used to track things like who has the asset (e.g., Melissa Layne), what type of asset this person has (e.g., a laptop), and where this asset is located (e.g., the research and innovation department). Sometimes database systems document why the person is using the asset (e.g., to analyze quantitative and qualitative data for her department). Asset management database systems can also be used for things like

-   Recording an asset's description: make, model, serial numbers, asset barcode, asset category, etc.

-   Recording an asset's acquisition and disposal information

-   Linking purchase receipts, manuals, and other digital documents to asset records

-   Tracking an asset's status and location

-   Obtaining a report listing assets assigned to a department or employee

-   Recording asset maintenance and repair histories (date, details, costs, etc.)

Some of the listed items will be discussed further in the "New User Set-Up Checklist" and "End-User Termination Checklist" sections later in the chapter. As you progress through more advanced topics and courses, there will be much more to learn about database systems.

NOTE   The difference between an inventory list and a database system is that an inventory list keeps track of the assets that the organization has given out to people and that it has as "extras." A database system tracks more detailed information about the assets.

Barcodes

Many inventory items have simple stickers or printed labels with barcodes---unique symbols/numbers that track specific items. Figure 28-1 shows a typical barcode. A barcode acts as a fingerprint for an item, binary code that can be readily scanned. One drawback to barcodes is that they're read-only. You can't add data or information to them at all.

Figure 28-1  Barcode on an SSD encoding its serial number

Asset Tags and IDs

Asset tags can use the radio frequency identification (RFID) wireless networking protocol to also keep track of inventory (see Figure 28-2). The asset tag includes an RFID tag (consisting of a microchip and antenna), which an RFID scanner or reader can electronically read and identify even without line of sight to the item. Most RFID tags are passive, meaning that the tag receives all the power it needs from the scanner's signal! An active RFID tag, on the other hand, uses a battery or external power source to send out and receive signals. Both types of RFID tags enable asset management. Unlike barcodes, the information stored in an RFID tag can be updated with new details.

Figure 28-2  RFID tag

Procurement Life Cycle

This is one of those topics that is a pain to talk about because every organization has its own process. For small companies, the procurement life cycle can be as simple as picking up the phone, making a few calls, and getting what they need. For highly bureaucratic organizations, the procurement life cycle can be a years-long process involving thousands of pages of rules. At its core, the procurement life cycle is the process involved in buying assets that your project needs. However, we are going to try to keep this simple and break down the procurement life cycle into six simple phases.

Identify Needs  Develop an understanding of what you need and why you need it. This can involve simple statements of work or complex documents detailing very specific objectives. This phase will vary from organization to organization and across use cases.

Evaluate Suppliers  Once you know what you need and why you need it, you need to scope out who provides the product or service you require. Sometimes this can be completed with a simple Web search. Other times it may require you to conduct a lengthy series of interviews. Typically, the cost of an implementation is directly proportional to the amount of time you spend evaluating the best supplier.

Negotiate Terms and Finalize the Purchase Order  When you have decided on the best supplier, you need to contact that supplier and enter into a negotiation of terms. Think of this as buying a car, but at a much larger scale. Everyone is willing to make concessions. In the world of business, it is how many concessions you can get, while maintaining quality, that matters in the end.

So, now you have bargained your way down to the very best terms that you can extract from the supplier. This is known as their best and final offer. You agree that this works for your organization, which then sends to the supplier a purchase order (PO) with relevant payment information. The supplier in turn sends an invoice to your organization to initiate the billing process.

Receive Invoice and Process Payment  Your organization receives an invoice, aligned with the purchase order, and sends the supplier the funds to facilitate payment. Are you finished? Not just yet.

Delivery and Audit  After the supplier has been paid, they deliver the service or product as promised. Upon implementation, you begin to monitor how effective the new service or product is compared to your previous state. This is called the audit.

Maintain Records for Future Audits  Everything is up and running. You are happy. The supplier is happy. Now you must continue to track effectiveness versus the return on investment (ROI), to assess periodically whether this solution is still effective or, if you need a new approach.

Warranty and Licensing

In the role of an asset manager, you will also need to keep track of warranty and licensing documentation. Although this may seem like an overwhelming task, as long as you have established solid security measures and adhere to licensing compliance requirements, you will be able to easily manage and update this important documentation. This in no way means that this job is easy. It's not. In terms of licensing compliance, the stakes are high. If, for example, a company has 50 unlicensed copies of a software application running on 400 of its computers, the company could face fines as high as $500,000!

Unlicensed assets are also linked to potential data loss. Data loss leads to privacy violations, and the snowball continues to get bigger and bigger. There are, however, software applications that can make the tracking job easier, such as various Software as a Service (SaaS) products that make maintaining compliance a little easier.

Assigned Users

Your organization may receive a set number of licenses for a particular product, such as software. This represents how many people in your organization can use the product. Sometimes suppliers are flexible, and they will say, "As long as you don't have more than ten people accessing our product, then everything is fine." Other times, suppliers want to know specifically who is using their product, and if this changes they will want to know who the replacement is. In this case the users are known as assigned users.

Individual organizations may also have their own rules about assigning user roles to individuals, even if the supplier does not require the organization to provide identities for individual users. When this is the case, it is often related to audits that determine if the right people are receiving access to the right products or services to ensure optimal performance of the organization as a whole.

Documentation for Policies, Procedures, Industry Standards, and Compliance

Organizations of every size should have a library of documents that cover the organization's policies and procedures and any industry standards and compliance regulations that apply to the organization. New employees should be given a package of these documents the first week on the job and instructed to review them. The onus, however, is on the employer to have these documents ready for new employees and to instill the need to apply the core principles contained within them to the organizational culture. Doing so will prevent issues, avoid inefficiencies, and create a sense of ownership.

Standard Operating Procedures

From a technician's point of view, the most common operating issue revolves around software, such as what sort of software users are allowed to install on their computers or, conversely, why you have to tell a user that he can't install the latest application that may help him do his job more effectively because that software isn't on the approved list. This can lead to some uncomfortable confrontations, but it's part of a tech's job.

EXAM TIP   The CompTIA A+ 1102 exam objectives call out procedures for custom installations of software packages. If your organization has rules about what software you can and can't install, it probably also has processes that lay out what to do when users request job-related software that isn't on the approved list. For example, folks who work out at NASA's Johnson Space Center here in Houston have to open a support ticket with the IT department if they need a program that isn't on the approved list. From there, the process governs how to decide if the software's license is acceptable, whether it will cause security or compatibility problems, and so on.

The concepts behind standard operating procedures (SOPs) are not meant to make a tech's life difficult and mundane. They are meant, for example, to stop users with insufficient technical skill or knowledge from installing malicious programs or applications that will destabilize their systems, thus keeping technical support calls down, which in turn enables techs to focus on more serious problems.

Organizations largely develop standard operating procedures for employees for two reasons: to enhance the success of the organization, and to meet government-related compliance requirements. Organizational policies include regulatory compliance policies, acceptable use polices, and password policies, among others. Because security is growing to include SOPs associated with regulatory compliance, risk management, end-user training, and so forth, those who have service desk responsibilities will likely have to eventually incorporate these SOPs to keep the organization secure.

Acceptable Use (AUP)

An acceptable use policy (AUP) describes what employees can and cannot do with the organization's property. An example of a common AUP provision is that a company laptop can be used only for company business. Another common AUP provision bars employees from accessing illegal Web sites from the organization's computers. AUPs are often very detailed and specific documents that employees must read, agree to, and sign as a step in the employment process.

Network Topology Diagrams

Network documentation provides a road map for current and future techs who need to make changes or repairs over time. For the most part, CompTIA Network+ techs and system administrators handle the oversight of the network, but CompTIA A+ techs do a lot of the implementation of fixes. A network topology diagram provides a map for how everything connects in an organization's network. These diagrams include switches, routers, WAPs, servers, and workstations (see Figure 28-3). More complex diagrams identify connection types and speeds, and the technologies in use (listing a WAP as an 802.11ax or Wi-Fi 6, for example). Many organizations rely on the Cisco icon set as a universal visual aid for creating these diagrams (see Figure 28-4).

Figure 28-3  Typical network topology diagram

Figure 28-4  A sampling of Cisco network diagram icons

Regulatory Compliance Requirements

Part of a government's job is to ensure safe work environments and minimize exploitation of workers. To this end, governments develop rules and regulations that specify how organizations are supposed to manage their workplaces, workers, and materials. Properly run organizations enforce regulatory compliance requirements---following the laws and regulations---to maintain a healthy workforce. Compliance means, in a nutshell, that members of an organization must abide by or comply with all of the rules that apply to the organization. Statutes with funny names such as Sarbanes-Oxley impose certain behaviors or prohibitions on what people can and cannot do in the workplace.

It has become commonplace for Web sites and applications to collect useful and informative data about their visitors and users. In this age of information overload, it's equally important that visitors and users understand that their usage data is being collected. To ensure there is understanding and agreement from both parties, many organizations have integrated a splash screen prior to using the application or Web site requiring users to agree to things such as data privacy, terms and conditions, or other compliance measures.

New-User Setup Checklist

To make the first day of work easier for new employees, most employers have developed documentation to make sure that they are not overwhelmed and, more importantly, that they have everything they need to start working.

One of these documents is a new-user setup checklist, which is a best practice associated with the documentation and support systems information management that techs use to ensure that a new user is set up with the proper equipment, network credentials, company policies and procedures, and so forth. New-user setup checklists are flexible, meaning that predefined items can be listed in a set order (1, 2, 3, etc.). Although the items may vary based on the employee's position and role in the company, here are some common items you might need to provide to a new employee:

-   Technology: PC, laptop, mouse/mouse pad, keyboard, phone, webcam, external storage

-   Software: product/project development, analytical, statistical, etc.

-   E-mail/messaging setup (e.g., Microsoft Outlook, Teams, Zoom, Teams, etc.)

-   Password security

-   Documentation for hardware or software for further reference on functionality provided

-   Documentation on data privacy policies for new employee to read and sign

-   Contact information provided if new employees have questions, issues, concerns, etc.

Good onboarding gets users to the point where they have everything they need to perform their job functions, they understand how to use it, and they understand and agree to any related security policies that could have a significant negative impact on them and the organization should they not practice them.

End-User Termination Checklist

For any number of reasons, voluntary or involuntary, an employee may leave an organization. Regardless of the reason, the IT department should complete an end-user termination checklist to ensure that the departing employee returns all equipment issued by the organization, that their network access has been removed, and, where applicable, that knowledge transfer is facilitated, such as requesting documents the user has created that could help their successor. If you are given this responsibility in your organization, you need to follow your organization's checklist carefully to make sure that the former employee cannot engage in malicious behavior.

Ticketing Systems

Ticketing systems help handle requests for technical assistance. Many companies use ticketing software internally to provide employees with technical support. Some companies also offer consumer ticketing services. For example, if a user encounters a problem with software, the system might allow them to submit a ticket to the software vendor to resolve the problem.

A ticketing system for internal use usually involves requests to an IT department. It streamlines the process for submitting problems and getting them resolved. Ticketing software for consumers might be assigned to a support person who is familiar with typical technical issues. According to CompTIA, some of the information needed to resolve an issue using a ticketing system might include:

-   User information (name, location, job position, etc.)

-   Date

-   Device information (type of device, model, serial, etc.)

-   Categories

-   Severity

-   Escalation levels

-   Problem description (clarity here is very important)

-   Progress notes

-   Problem resolution (never forget this, always document your findings)

Clear, concise writing is critical when it comes to the problem description, notes, and resolution. You probably won't be the only tech responding to every ticket, so it's important that your coworkers can understand what the problem is and how it is being addressed. Figure 28-5 shows how this information might be presented on a trouble ticket.

Figure 28-5  A typical interface for a ticketing system

Here is an example of how a ticketing system process might play out. Jamie's company computer is not starting. She contacts the IT department by submitting a helpdesk "ticket" in which she provides necessary information (name, date, device information, description of problem, etc.) that helps the responding tech, Jamal, get an initial idea of what the issue is and how to help resolve the issue.

Next, depending on the type of ticketing system, Jamal the tech contacts user Jamie and asks her to explain in further detail what is wrong with the computer. Jamal starts troubleshooting by asking questions such as "Is the computer plugged in?" and "Is the power source completely plugged into the PC?" He also takes notes, documenting his questions and her responses, and any information about their interaction regarding the issue. Jamie responds to Jamal's questions until they have pinpointed the issue with the computer. Depending on the severity of the issue, the issue either will be resolved and the ticket will be closed or, if the issue cannot be resolved, the ticket will be escalated to another tech who might have more in-depth experience and guidance to help solve Jamie's PC issue.

Knowledge Base/Articles

Organizations use documentation to enable cooperation among employees and coordination among departments. From a tech's perspective, documentation helps in troubleshooting various issues. Creating and maintaining a company knowledge base---a set of documents that tell the tale of equipment used, problems encountered, and solutions to those problems---provides an essential tool for current and future techs. The articles could be, for example, articles from third-party tech sources that apply to the organization's equipment, such as Cisco articles about the routers the organization uses.

Change-Management Best Practices

CompTIA A+ techs are well positioned to offer valuable change management insights. You see what works, what doesn't, and what needs to change. The old laser printers in the accounting department, for example, can't keep up with user needs and you're spending way too much time each week keeping them running. And you're tired of users complaining to you. Change is needed.

Change isn't only grass-roots driven, but often comes from the top. Every organization has formal and informal change-management processes and a designated individual to oversee these processes. You can't just buy a new laser printer, for example, without considering the cost and impact. You can't upgrade the operating systems for 100 users without thorough testing and analysis of the OS. Let's take a closer look at change-management best practices, which include documented business processes and the change-management process.

Documented Business Processes

Every step of a change needs documented business processes. Documented business processes include a plan to return an infrastructure to its pre-change environment, the steps to create an operational environment for development and/or testing, as well as appointing an individual who is responsible for these types of processes. Let's take a look at these three documented business processes, which the CompTIA A+ 1102 objectives identify, respectively, as rollback plan, sandbox testing, and responsible staff member.

Rollback Plan

What if an executed change is a failure? This happens more than you think. Therefore, before a change occurs, a rollback plan must be in place that defines the steps needed to return the infrastructure to its pre-change environment. OS rollbacks, uninstallation, or return to old equipment are all possible parts of a good rollback plan.

For example, Jamie at Bayland Widgets Corp. (BWC) wants to upgrade 16 systems in the design lab from Windows 7 to Windows 11. She obtains approval from management and subsequently implements the upgrade. After a few days, several users have complained that an important CAD application BWC uses is having issues, such as software freezes.

Jamie looks at the rollback plan documentation that lays out the steps for undoing the upgrades. She follows through with the undo process, making notes about the steps, then awaits further instructions for how to get the design lab computers upgraded without failures.

Sandbox Testing

Simply put, a sandbox is a place where you can experiment without messing up the primary system. A sandbox usually is a virtualized environment (refer to Chapter 22) that isolates the test machine from the host machine to avoid causing additional problems. The ability to restore a VM or container from a snapshot makes each of them an ideal choice for sandbox testing, which entails checking out new and updated applications without putting the systems and data you depend on at risk.

Responsible Staff Member

Activities like rollback plans and sandbox testing (and change management, discussed in the next section) are typically led by a responsible staff member (RSM). This individual leads projects like these by following policies, processes, and procedures that have been developed (and likely refined over time) toward facilitating, coordinating, and implementing projects.

For example, Janice, the director of the accounting department, needs 20 of her employees' computers upgraded to Windows 11. Who does she contact to initiate this change? The responsible staff member, of course! This person is appointed by IT department leadership and will assist Janice from the beginning of the upgrade all the way to the end. Depending on the size of your organization, the RSM may be the person who addresses the problem themselves or a manager who coordinates with others to get it fixed.

Change-Management Process

A change-management process enables organizations to implement changes to IT infrastructure in a safe and cost-effective manner. Any organization with a change-management process should have documents that lay out the steps, who performs them, and how they go about it.

One of your first jobs as a tech is to consult these documents so that---when change comes your way (either from you or from on high)---you'll already understand the process. When it's time for a change, start by reviewing this process to avoid being embarrassed about (and possibly disciplined for) missing some important step.

There's no single guide to change management, though most organizations follow common-sense guidelines. This section provides an outline of the change-management best practices CompTIA recommends. A package created by a CompTIA A+ tech should include all the documentation just discussed, plus receipts, overtime records, an inventory of changed systems, lists of new users created, signed end-user acceptance forms, and so on.

Request Forms

A request form kicks off the change-management process. At some point, someone (maybe you or maybe the CIO of the company you work for) identifies a problem that needs to be fixed and submits a basic request form to IT. Depending on your organization, this form may range from a simple one-pager to an extremely complex set of documents. However, regardless of the level of complexity, all request forms have three things in common. They state the problem, what needs to be fixed, and what the desired outcome is.

Beyond these essentials, other information may be needed, such as why this change is important, who it will benefit, how soon it needs to be implemented, and a host of other factors. Again, these requirements all vary depending on the organization you work for and the procedures and requirements it has put in place. The key thing to remember here is that if you submit a change request form, you should be ready to explain why the change is needed. If you can do that, the rest is all a matter of following processes, which you will pick up quickly.

Determine the Purpose of the Change

No organization is ever going to give you new equipment or allow you to make upgrades without knowing why they are needed. To propose a change, you'll almost certainly need to document the purpose of the change. Returning to the scenario from the earlier "Rollback Plan" section in which Jamie at BWC wanted to upgrade 16 systems in the design lab from Windows 7 to Windows 11, users have demanded the latest OS from Microsoft to better serve customers who have (all) jumped to Windows 11. The purpose of the change, therefore, is improved performance and support for clients.

Determine the Scope of the Change

Usually included as part of the purpose of the change, the scope of the change defines who and what this change will affect. This includes an inventory of all systems involved, the number of people involved in making the change, how long the change will take, and often the estimated cost of the change.

In our design lab scenario, Jamie estimates that in order to upgrade 16 computing devices to Windows 11, she will need approximately three people to help with the upgrade, and it should be completed in three days. With this information, in addition to a determination of which edition of Windows 11 will be installed, Jamie now has a pretty good idea of what her overall budget will be.

Document the Date and Time of the Change

Knowing when changes will be deployed is essential. Depending on the application and your organization, anywhere from a few people to literally thousands of people may be impacted. Thus, a clearcut date and time needs to be established for when any system changes will occur. You don't want to be "that guy" who pushes the big red button and sends their company into complete chaos. Imagine that your alarm clock has been set to play heavy metal music at maximum volume and you have no idea what time it will go off. If the music starts to blare before you want to get up, you would very likely wake up extremely grumpy and the day that followed would be far from optimal. This is exactly what your colleagues will be like if you don't adequately document the date and time associated with system changes.

Determine Impact

This phase of change management can be a little tricky, depending on the existing level of documentation related to your systems. Your goal here is to identify which systems the change will impact (both the system the change is made to and its interconnected systems) and to what extent they will be impacted (e.g., unavailable to users for two hours). In a perfect world, every organization should have a complete architectural mapping of all systems and the interrelationships that exist between components. When this is the case, you can reference the documentation and trace where connections exist and deduce where the change will likely impact other systems. This enables you to give everyone a heads-up as to what to expect, when it will happen, and what steps they might need to take. However, you aren't always going to be in a situation where you have access to a complete overview of how systems are connected.

There is an old joke in the IT world that goes like this, "There is only one guy who knows how this all works and he died three years ago." Yea, it's rather gallows humor, but unfortunately it is frequently applicable in a general sense. As organizations grow, they have the tendency to stack systems upon systems, with little or no documentation explaining what happened, when it happened, or why it happened. If this describes your organization, you are in the unenviable spot of basically flying with one eye covered. However, by acquainting yourself with the systems that you will be working with, you will quickly learn how things are connected, and when asked to perform this type of assessment, you can make assumptions as to where interrelationships exist. The key here is to remember the old adage "Better safe than sorry." So, if anything, be overly cautious and prepare others for the worst-case scenario.

Analyze the Level of Risk

All changes to infrastructure come with risk. A proper change-management request will certainly require a risk analysis, a detailed assessment of possible problems that could result from the change to determine the risk level of the change. Determining the risk level will include the development of a non-exhaustive list of questions covering as many possible things that could go wrong during the change. What if the upgrade fails? Has the new application been tested on a sample system? Will the new computers have adequate firewalls? Don't panic (well, not too much), as any risk analysis will almost certainly be passed off to a security person in your organization---but that person might have great interest in your opinions and concerns!

Change Board Approvals

So, Jamie has all this documentation to back up her request to upgrade 16 design lab computers to Windows 11. She has documented the purpose and scope of the change, the proposed date and time of the change, the affected systems and corresponding impact, and the level of risk the changes poses. Now she needs to submit this documentation to the change board to obtain their approval. The change board consists of techs and representatives from management, IT security, and administration who meet on a regular basis (quarterly is common). They review the change documentation and either approve or deny the change, but more often than not they first ask for more information or details, making a "proposal--rejection--fix--back to change board" cycle that repeats itself until everyone is satisfied.

Plan for the Change

If you receive approval from the change board, you'll need to plan for the change. What needs to be done before the change starts? What needs to be purchased? Where will new, uninstalled equipment be stored? On which days will you implement this change? During what time period? Who will cover your other duties while you're otherwise engaged? Anything that needs to be ready before you start is covered in the plan for the change.

End-User Acceptance

Part of successful change management is educating the end users in both the need for the change and how to adapt to changed systems. End-user acceptance is vital for successful change. More than anything else this means training. Do the users know how to use the new features on your super printer? What new features in this OS upgrade do end users need to learn? Are the end users versed in the new application (and know not to use the old one)?

Now let's shift gears and discuss how you and end users need to be aware of environmental impacts and how to control them so that your organization's existing technology is protected, as well as technology you may have proposed to implement in a potential change-management plan.

Environmental Impacts and Local Environmental Controls

Computers are surrounded by a host of dangers all just waiting to wreak havoc. In addition to power surges, brownouts, and blackouts, discussed in Chapter 7, there are other factors that could negatively affect your computer. Environmental factors such as chemicals stored near your computer, dust, heat, cold, wet...it's a jungle out there!

Managing environmental controls requires a person who can multitask. They must make sure the equipment is working properly and is maintained and monitored, and they must also be ready for any unexpected variables to pop up in the interim. A person in this type of position undoubtedly needs clear processes and procedures in place to make sure that a certain level of protection has been met.

EXAM TIP   Expect questions on environmental threats, impacts, and how to control them on the CompTIA A+ 220-1102 exam.

Temperature, Humidity, and Ventilation

Proper local environmental controls help secure servers and workstations from the environmental impact of excessive heat, dust, and humidity. Such environmental controls include air conditioning, proper ventilation, air filtration, and monitors for temperature and humidity. A CompTIA A+ technician maintains an awareness of temperature, humidity level, and ventilation, so that he or she can tell very quickly when levels or settings are out of whack.

A computer works best in an environment where the air is clean, dry, and room temperature. CompTIA doesn't expect you to become an environmental engineer, but it does expect you to explain and deal with how dirty or humid or hot air can affect a computer. We've covered all of these topics to some extent throughout the book, so let's just do a quick overview with security in mind.

Ventilation Patrol

Most computers are designed to operate at room temperature, which is somewhere in the area of 22°C (72°F) with the relative humidity in the 30--40 percent range. Colder and dryer is better for computers (but not for people), so the real challenge is when the temperature and the humidity go higher.

A modern office will usually have a good heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) system, so your job as a tech is to make sure that nothing interferes with the proper functioning of your HVAC system. That means you're pretty much always on ventilation patrol. Watch for the following to make sure air is flowing:

-   Make sure ducts are always clear of obstructions.

-   Make sure duct dampers are adjusted for proper airflow (not too hot or too cold).

-   Make sure equipment is located in an area with proper ventilation.

Dirty Air

Dust and debris aren't good for any electronic components. Your typical office air conditioning does a pretty good job of eliminating the worst offenders, but not all computers are in nice offices. No matter where the computers reside, you need to monitor your systems for dirt. The best way to do this is observation as part of your regular work. Dust and debris will show up all over the systems, but the best place to look are the fans. Fans will collect dust and dirt quickly (see Figure 28-6).

Figure 28-6  Dirty fan

Dust Cleanup  All electronic components get dirty over time. To clean them, you need to use either compressed air or a nonstatic vacuum. So which one do you use? The rule is simple: If you don't mind dust blowing all over the place, use compressed air. If you don't want dust blowing all over the place, use a vacuum.

Airborne Particle Protection  Computers and the individuals operating them are typically in enclosed, indoor environments. Just as you would in your own home, changing the air filters on a regular basis reduces the amount of airborne particles coming through the filters. Dedicate a certain date to change all of the filters and make sure to always keep an inventory of the correct size filters ready for the next filter change. Another option to protect against airborne particles is to wear a mask such as the N95 masks sold in many home improvement and hardware stores.

Location/Equipment Placement  Equipment closets filled with racks of servers need proper airflow to keep things cool and to control dusty air. Make sure that the room is ventilated and air-conditioned (see Figure 28-7) and that the air filters are changed regularly.

Figure 28-7  Air-conditioning vent in a small server closet

If things are really bad, you can enclose a system in a dust shield. Dust shields come complete with their own filters to keep a computer clean and happy even in the worst of environments.

EXAM TIP   Always use proper ventilation, air filters, and enclosures. To protect against airborne particles, consider wearing a protective mask.

Hazardous Materials

Offices are filled with chemicals and substances that pose health risks. Some of these risks are immediate---hazardous materials can burst into flames or damage your skin, lungs, and eyes. Others may cause cancer or other health conditions through regular exposure over many years. The CompTIA A+ 1102 objectives want you to know about compliance to government regulations that apply to working with these substances.

Regulations may sound intimidating, but the goal here is simple: people who work with or around dangerous substances deserve to know what the risks are, what precautions they should take, and what to do if there's an accident. You'll need to consult and comply with local regulations, but you should at least be familiar with the material safety data sheet (MSDS)---a document that details the risks, precautions, and clean-up/disposal procedures---for any substances you work with regularly and know how to find the MSDS if something you aren't familiar with spills. For specific information on proper battery and toner disposal, and other device and asset disposal, take a look at Chapters 11 and 26.

Recycling E-Waste

Most U.S. cities have one or more environmental services centers that you can use to recycle electronic components. For your city, try a Google (or other search engine) search on the term "environmental services" and you'll almost certainly find a convenient place for e-waste disposal.

Prohibited Content/Activity and Privacy, Licensing, and Policies

Organizations need policies and procedures in place to deal with negative events that affect their networks and systems---an incidence response. The larger the organization, the more detailed the incidence response, ranging from the team involved to the planning and steps in every contingency. This is a gigantic topic that is covered in more advanced certifications, such as CompTIA Security+. From a CompTIA A+ tech's standpoint, you need to understand your role and what you should (and definitely should not) do when responding to an incident involving prohibited content or activity. This section explains how prohibited content, computer-related activity, and licensing can trigger negative events and also outlines the important steps to take in the unfortunate instance that such a negative event happens.

Try to stay away from any personal information on a PC. If you find something private (that isn't illegal), ignore it and forget about it. If you find something illegal, you must follow the proper procedures. If a device you work on becomes evidence in legal proceedings, isolate the system and document everything that happens going forward. Pay special attention to the chain of custody or whoever is currently in control of the machine.

Data Classification

Larger organizations, such as government entities, benefit greatly from organizing their data according to its sensitivity---what's called data classification---and making certain that computer hardware and software stay as uniform as possible. In addition, many government and internal regulations apply fairly rigorously to these organizations.

Data classification systems vary by the organization, but a common scheme classifies documents as public, internal use only, highly confidential, top secret, and so on. Using a classification scheme enables employees such as techs to know very quickly what to do with documents, the drives containing documents, and more. Your strategy for recycling a computer system left from a migrated user, for example, will differ a lot if the data on the drive was classified as internal use only or top secret.

Data classification goes hand in hand with data retention requirements, which dictate how long data needs to be kept by an organization, and is often related to how it has been classified. Customer data, security logs, and employee data, all can be covered under a company's data retention requirements. After the pre-determined period of retention, data can be disposed of, but until then, it needs to be kept just as safely as data that is currently still in use.

Regulated Data

Regulated data is data that requires specific privacy and security safeguards as mandated by federal, state, or local laws or regulations or by industry standards or regulations. An organization's technology policies must clearly address these privacy and security safeguards. There are four types of regulated data that IT departments must protect. Let's look at each.

Credit Card Transactions

The Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS) is a rigorous set of rules for securing systems that accept, transmit, process, or store credit/debit card payments.

Personally Identifiable Information

Personally identifiable information (PII) is a big umbrella term for any data that can lead back to a specific individual. Regulating and protecting PII will continue to be an issue for industries and government organizations for a long, long time. The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) is a fairly new law that defines a broad set of rights and protections for the personal information of citizens living in countries in the European Union. Consult your superiors about your organization's policies for working with regulated data.

Laws protecting data have been developed so that organizations can create their own PII documentation for their employees to follow. The main premise behind these laws is that some information collected from individuals contains sensitive information that could easily identify who they are. Also, these regulatory laws specify that any PII data should be permanently deleted if there is no use for it. Never, in any circumstance, should PII be shared with anyone.

A sub-category of PII is personal government-issued information. Personal government-issued information consists of things like social security numbers, driver's license or passport numbers, a birth certificate, all of which, unsurprisingly, are issued by the government. These documents and the information they contain are sensitive and can leave someone vulnerable to serious identity theft if they fall into the wrong hands, and special care must be taken to protect them.

Protected Healthcare Data

Protected health information (PHI), or simply healthcare data, is basically any data that involves a person's health status, medical records, and healthcare services they have received. Like PII, PHI should never be shared unless given permission by the owner of that information.

Compliance

Compliance means that members of an organization must abide by or comply with all of the rules that apply to the organization. As we discussed earlier when we talked about standard operating procedures, the most common compliance issue revolves around software, such as what sort of software users are allowed to install on their computers. Compliance keeps technical support calls down and enables techs to focus on more serious problems---like an incident response.

Licensing, End-User License Agreement, and Digital Rights Management

Software licensing has many twists that can easily lead a user or a tech out of compliance. Like other creative acts, programmers are granted copyright to the software they create. The copyright owner then decides how he or she or it (the corporation) will license that software for others to use. Licenses can be for personal use or corporate use. They can also be valid licenses or non-expired licenses. Licenses can be closed source or open source. Each of these options has variations as well, so this gets complex. Let's start at the top and work through the variations.

Personal Use License Versus Corporate Use License

For moral or philosophical reasons, some developers want their software to be free for some or all purposes. When Linus Torvalds created the Linux operating system, for example, he made it freely available for everyone. GIMP image-editing software likewise is available to download and use for free.

Personal use licenses have variations. Many personal use programs are "free" only for personal use. If you want to use the excellent TeamViewer remote access program at your office, for example, you need to buy a corporate license. But if you want to log in to your home machine from your personal laptop, you can use TeamViewer for free. When software is released under a corporate use license, you have a legal obligation to pay money for access to it---but a lot of variations apply. Traditionally, you bought a copy of a program and could use it forever, sell it to someone else, or give it away. You bought copies for each user with a personal use license, or multiple users with an enterprise license.

Today, the picture is muddier. You can buy the use of Microsoft Office, for example, as long as you pay a monthly or yearly fee. The personal use license enables you to share the software with several other people or accounts and use it on several of your personal machines.

License Validity and Expiration

Many software licenses come with strings attached, and as techs we must pay careful attention to them. For example, a license might say how many systems you can install it on, how many human users it can have, how many CPUs you can run it on, whether you're allowed to use it for commercial purposes, whether someone who owns a valid license can transfer it to anyone else, which version(s) of the software the license is valid for, or even how long the license will remain valid.

A license is valid when your organization complies completely with these stipulations. Some programs that demand a license key may straight-up tell you if the license key itself is no longer valid---but confirmation that the license key is valid doesn't mean you're off the hook when it comes to complying with every last clause in the license. Some licenses stipulate that you can only use the software with a non-expired license. Other licenses permit you to keep using the installed version after the license has expired but cut off your access to updates and security patches until you renew the license.

EXAM TIP   At first glance, valid licenses and non-expired licenses seem to mean the same thing; however, it's important to know the distinctions between the two for the 1102 exam, objective 4.6.

Open Source Licenses

Another huge variation in software use and licensing is what you can do with the source code of an application. Open source licenses generally allow you to take the original code and modify it. Some open source licenses require you to make the modified code available for free download; others don't require that at all. Closed source licenses stipulate that you can't modify the source code or make it part of some other software suite.

End-User License Agreements

The end-user license agreement (EULA) that you must accept to be able to proceed when opening or installing new software obligates you to abide by the use and sharing guidelines stipulated by the software copyright holder. When you agree to the EULA, in other words, you're agreeing not to do things like make illegal copies of the software or attempt to reverse-engineer how it works. The EULA may also give the copyright holder permission to collect data on you and how you use the software and limit whether (or for how much) you can sue the copyright holder if it mangles your files or causes other problems.

Digital Rights Management

Software and media companies use various forms of digital rights management (DRM) technology to try to enforce their policies regarding when, where, and how we can use the software or access media such as video, music, and books. In short, DRM is one way the industry has tried to fight software and media piracy over the years. Many programs require activation over the Internet, for example, or a special account with the copyright holder. Some media files can only be opened by the provider's official app.

NOTE   The key for a tech is to know the specific licenses paid for by the tech's organization and ensure that the organization abides by those licenses. Using pirated software, exceeding the use limits set by a EULA, and using programs that aren't licensed for commercial use in a corporate setting all expose your organization to lawsuits.

Incident Response

Organizations have incident response policies and procedures to deal with negative events. CompTIA A+ techs might be members of the incident response team. As such they need to understand first response actions, identification and reporting of incidents, and chain of custody. Let's start by looking at first response actions.

First Response

First response means securing the area, determining the scope of the incident, and analyzing the impact the incident might have on the organization. If you're part of the incident response team, your first response duties will be spelled out in detail in the incident response plan. Most likely, your team's first action when something bad happens is to secure the area. Securing the area can mean physical lockdown---no one in or out---or other lockdown---no network traffic in or out of the affected section.

Incident Reporting

An incident report means telling your supervisor about the data you've gathered regarding a computer or network incident. This provides a record of what you've done and accomplished. It also provides information that, when combined with other information you may or may not know, could reveal a pattern or bigger problem to someone higher up the chain.

This can be accomplished with a documentation of incident. Many companies have pre-made forms that you simply fill out and submit. Other places are less formal. Regardless, you need to do this!

Tracking specific problems through incident reports documentation helps current and future techs deal with problematic hardware and individuals. If you have five identical color laser printers in five departments, for example, and one starts jamming regularly after 10,000 pages, documenting the problem---the incident---and the solution will point very clearly to the potential problems with the other four printers when they reach that same usage level.

Once you've gathered data about a particular system or dealt with a computer or network problem, what's next?

Inform Management/Law Enforcement as Necessary

So, you have documented all of the necessary information needed about the incident. Now it's time for you to make a decision. Is the incident at a low risk level and can be resolved at your level? Or, is it something that has escalated to a higher risk level where you need to inform your supervisor? Determine the scope of the incident (single system, whole group of users, and so on) and explore its seriousness and potential impact on the organization. Determining the scope of the incident can be accomplished by questioning users, reviewing log files, and so on. Your network and security people will handle possible impact scenarios and determine if the impact is serious enough to include law enforcement in the investigation.

Chain of Custody

When responding to an incident involving prohibited content or activity, there must be an end-to-end process for identifying who owns what, where it is, and who is liable for it. It asks and answers, "Whose responsibility is this?" when assets, digital or physical, transfer hands in an organization. For example, who is in charge and liable for data integrity (ensuring that the data is in its original and uncorrupted form) and data preservation (ensuring that the data is backed up and kept available)? Where is the data stored (i.e., drive, server)? This process, called the chain of custody, begins when the evidence is initially seized or collected and establishes a continuous accounting of where the evidence is at all times, who has possessed it, what activities were performed on it, and the details of its storage, use, and transfer. This process helps to ensure the integrity of evidence and minimizes the possibility that it has been altered or tampered with. Chain of custody contributes to the admissibility and value of evidence in court.

Beyond A+

Whew! You've just finished a book that covers everything you need to know to take and pass the CompTIA A+ 1101/1102 exams. Congratulations! What's next?

First, go back to the Introduction and review the study chart and guidelines. Review, review, review! Take the practice exams and look for exam sources online to get even more scoop on the types of questions you'll see.

Second, schedule your exams if you haven't already done so (pressure and diamonds and all that). Having that endpoint in sight helps focus.

Go back to my original question once you've taken and passed both CompTIA A+ exams: What's next? The two logical steps are to start studying for CompTIA Network+ and CompTIA Security+. These complete CompTIA's Core curriculum and round out tech skills needed for today's interconnected and security-heightened world. There are a lot of great writers and videographers out there who have excellent materials on CompTIA Network+ and Security+ (including me), so you won't find it hard to get study materials.

Good luck, my friend, and keep in touch!
