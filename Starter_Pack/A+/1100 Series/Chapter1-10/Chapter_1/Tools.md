Electrostatic Discharge (ESD)

All computing devices use electricity. As long as the electricity runs properly through the circuits and wires as designed, all is good. There are times when electricity improperly jumps from one place to another in ways that cause damage, an electromagnetic pulse (EMP). An EMP shows up in many ways. Lightning is a form of EMP. Lightning hitting your electrical equipment certainly makes for a bad day! Nuclear detonations also create a massive EMP burst (yikes!), but the EMP of most concern to techs is electrostatic discharge (ESD).

ESD simply means the passage of a static electrical charge from one item to another. Have you ever rubbed a balloon against your shirt, making the balloon stick to you? That's a classic example of static electricity. When that static charge discharges, you may not notice it happening---although on a cool, dry day, I've been shocked so hard by touching a doorknob that I could see a big, blue spark! I've never heard of a human being getting anything worse than a rather nasty shock from ESD, but I can't say the same thing about computers. ESD will destroy the sensitive parts of any computing device, so it is essential that you take steps to avoid ESD when working on a PC or other computing device.

NOTE   All computing devices are well protected against ESD on the outside. Unless you take a screwdriver or pry tool and open up a PC or other computing device, you don't need to concern yourself with ESD.

Antistatic Tools

ESD only takes place when two objects that store different amounts (the hip electrical term to use is potential ) of static electricity come in contact. The secret to avoiding ESD is to keep you and the parts of the computer you touch at the same electrical potential, otherwise known as grounding yourself to the computing device. You can accomplish this by connecting yourself to the computer via a handy little device called an electrostatic discharge (ESD) strap. This simple device consists of a wire that connects on one end to an alligator clip and on the other end to a small metal plate that secures to your wrist with an elastic strap. You snap the alligator clip onto any handy metal part of the computer and place the ESD strap on either wrist. Figure 1-6 shows a typical electrostatic discharge (ESD) strap in use.

EXAM TIP   Static electricity, and therefore the risk of ESD, is much more prevalent in dry, cool environments.

NOTE   Make sure the metal plate on the ESD strap touches the skin of your wrist. Don't put it on over the sleeve of a long-sleeved shirt.

Electrostatic discharge (ESD) straps are standard equipment for anyone working on a computing device, but other tools might also come in handy. One of the big issues when working with a computer occurs if you find yourself pulling out parts from the computer and setting them aside. The moment you take a piece out of the computer, it no longer has contact with the systems and may pick up static from other sources. Techs use antistatic mats to eliminate this risk. An electrostatic discharge mat---or ESD mat---acts as a point of common potential; it's typical to purchase a combination ESD strap and mat that all connect to keep you, the computer, and any loose components at the same electrical potential (see Figure 1-7).

Figure 1-7  Electrostatic discharge (ESD) strap and mat combination

EXAM TIP   Always put components in an antistatic bag, not on the bag.

ESD straps and mats use tiny resistors---devices that stop or resist the flow of electricity---to prevent a static charge from racing through the device. These resistors can fail over time, so it's always a good idea to read the documentation that comes with your antistatic tools to see how to test those small resistors properly.

Any electrical component not in a computer case needs to be stored in an antistatic bag, a specially designed bag that sheds whatever static electricity you have when you touch it, thus preventing any damage to components stored within (see Figure 1-8). Almost all components come in an antistatic bag when purchased. Experienced techs never throw these bags away, as you never know when you'll want to pull a part out and place it on a shelf for a while.

Figure 1-8  Antistatic bag

Although having an ESD strap with you at all times would be ideal, the reality is that from time to time you'll find yourself in a situation where you lack the proper antistatic tools. This shouldn't keep you from working on the computer---if you're careful! Before working on a computer in such a situation, take a moment to touch the power supply---I'll show you where it is in Chapter 2---to make sure you are at the same electrical potential as the computer. Repeat every once in a while as you work. Although this isn't as good as a wrist strap, this equipment grounding is better than nothing at all.

Use these tools for proper component handling and storage: ESD straps, ESD mats, antistatic bags, and equipment grounding.

Antistatic Protection Devices

In some circumstances, an antistatic protection device such as an ESD strap could get in the way. Manufacturers have developed some alternatives to the wrist strap, so try this:

1\.   Take a field trip to a local computer or electronics store.

2\.   Check out their selection of antistatic devices. Can you find anything other than wrist straps or mats?

3\.   Do a Web search for "static control products." Can you find anything other than wrist straps or mats?

4\.   Report what options you can find for protecting your equipment from ESD. Weigh the pros and cons and decide what you would use in various situations.

The last issue regarding ESD is that never-ending question---should you work with the computing device plugged in or unplugged? The answer is simple: Do you really want to be physically connected to a computer that is plugged into an electrical outlet? Granted, the chances of electrocution are slim, but why take the risk?

EXAM TIP   Always disconnect power before repairing a personal computing device.

Removing the power applies also when working on portable computers. Disconnect both the battery and the power cord from the wall outlet and remove the battery. With mobile devices such as tablets and smartphones, this creates an issue because the battery is inside the case. Chapter 25 covers the special skills needed for working on mobile devices.

Electromagnetic Interference (EMI)

A magnetic field interfering with electronics is electromagnetic interference (EMI). EMI isn't nearly as dangerous as ESD, but it can cause permanent damage to some components and erase data on some storage devices. You can prevent EMI by keeping magnets away from computer equipment. Certain components are particularly susceptible to EMI, especially storage devices like hard drives.

The biggest problem with EMI is that we often use magnets without even knowing we are doing so. Any device with an electrical motor has a magnet. Many telephones have magnets. Power bricks for laptops and speakers also have magnets. Even a lowly screwdriver might have a magnet. Keep them away!

Radio Frequency Interference (RFI)

Do you ever hear strange noises on your speakers even though you aren't playing any sounds? Do you ever get strange noises on your cell phone? If so, you've probably run into radio frequency interference (RFI). Many devices emit radio waves:

-   Cell phones

-   Wireless network cards/access points

-   Cordless phones

-   Baby monitors

-   Microwave ovens

In general, the radio waves that these devices emit are very weak, and almost all electronic devices are shielded to prevent RFI. A few devices, speakers in particular, are susceptible to RFI. RFI will never cause any damage, but it can be incredibly irritating. The best way to prevent RFI is to keep radio-emitting devices as far away as possible from other electronics.

RFI becomes a big problem when two devices share the same frequencies. Baby monitors, Internet of things (IoT) devices (like wireless surveillance cameras), and many wireless networks share the same range of frequencies. They sometimes interfere with each other, causing poor signals or even blocking signals completely. These devices need to be tuned to avoid stomping on each other's frequencies. In Chapter 20 you'll see how to tune a wireless network to prevent RFI.

NOTE   Computer gear manufacturers package their products in a variety of ways to shield against accidental damage, whether that's physical damage, ESD, EMI, or RFI. The typical pink translucent computer bag is coated with a film that prevents the bag from producing static electricity and mildly protects the contents against physical contact (and thus damage). Two types of metal bags offer shielding against EMI and RFI as well as ESD. These are the silvery bags (such as shown previously in Figure 1-8) you'll see hard drives packed in, for example, and the black-and-silver woven bags you'll sometimes see. These bags are easy to purchase online and are a cheap insurance policy to protect your expensive components.

Physical Tools

The basic tech toolkit consists of a Phillips-head screwdriver and not much else---seriously---but a half-dozen tools round out a fully functional toolkit. Most kits have a star-headed Torx wrench, a nut driver or two, a pair of plastic tweezers, a little grabber tool (the technical term is parts retriever), a hemostat, and both Phillips-head and flat-head screwdrivers (see Figure 1-9).

Figure 1-9  Typical technician toolkit

I'll add a few more tools to this toolkit as the book progresses that you'll want for a not-so-basic toolkit. Those more advanced tools will be introduced as your knowledge grows.

You already own another great tool, the camera in your smartphone or tablet. It's amazing how handy it is to photograph screw locations, cable connections, or other conditions so that you can later retrieve those images when you reinstall something.

A lot of techs throw in an extension magnet to grab hard-to-reach bits that drop into cases (an exception to the "no magnets" rule). Many also add a magnifying glass and a flashlight for those hard-to-read numbers and text on the printed circuit boards (PCBs) that make up a large percentage of devices inside the system unit. Contrary to what you might think, techs rarely need a hammer.

Mobile devices such as tablets and smartphones require more complex kits that include specialized tools, such as prying tools (called spudgers---isn't that a great word?). There are many excellent toolkits available for purchase; I recommend the toolkits sold by iFixit (https://www.ifixit.com) and use one myself (Figure 1-10). These kits are inexpensive and reliable, plus iFixit has hundreds of free videos that walk you through many scenarios using the kits.

Personal Safety

IT techs live in a dangerous world. We're in constant danger of tripping, hurting our backs, and getting burned by hot components. You also need to keep in mind what you wear (in a safety sense). Let's take a moment to discuss these personal safety issues and what to do about them.

CAUTION   When thinking about safety, maintain compliance with government regulations. You may be required to wear certain protective gear or take extra precautions while in the workplace. Make sure you also follow any environmental rules for the disposal of old parts, especially with things like batteries and toner cartridges, which may contain hazardous or toxic materials. Check with your employer or your local government's Web site for more information.

If you don't stay organized, hardware technology will take over your life. Figure 1-11 shows a corner of my office, a painful example of cable "kludge."

Figure 1-11  Mike's cable kludge

Cable messes such as these are dangerous tripping hazards. While I may allow a mess like this in my home office, all cables in a business environment are carefully tucked away behind computer cases, run into walls, or placed under cable runners. If you see a cable that is an obvious tripping hazard, contact the person in charge of the building to take care of it immediately. The results of ignoring such hazards can be catastrophic (see Figure 1-12). Use proper cable management to avoid these dangers.

Figure 1-12  What a strange, bad trip it's been.

Another personal safety issue is heavy boxes. Computers, printers, monitors---everything we use---all seem to come to us in heavy boxes. Use proper lifting techniques. Remember never to lift with your back; lift with your legs, and always use a hand truck if available. Pay attention to weight limitations on the devices you use to move anything heavy. You are never paid enough to risk your own health.

You also need to watch out for hot components. It's hard to burn yourself unless you open up a computer, printer, or monitor. First, watch for anything with a cooling fan like the one shown in Figure 1-13. If you see a cooling fan, odds are good that something is hot enough to burn you---such as the metal cooling fins below the fan. Also look for labels or stickers warning about hot components. Last, when in doubt, move your hand over components as if you were checking the heat on a stove.

Figure 1-13  Checking for hot cooling fins

NOTE   A non-contact thermometer is another useful tool to have on hand. Not only is it more precise than your hand, it can read the temperature of components deep in hard-to-reach corners of a device.

Disconnect a computer from its electrical source before you work on it, if possible. In the rare event where you need to work on a live system, take caution. Provide electrical fire safety equipment in rooms or locations that have a fire risk, such as server rooms. All those electronics and all that juice make a dangerous combination in those rare circumstances in which bad things happen. Keep properly rated (Class C) fire extinguishers handy.

EXAM TIP   When you build out a computer space, such as a server closet (the room that has a lot of important computers in it), use standard carpentry safety techniques. Wear an air filter mask, when cutting drywall, for example. Wear safety goggles when using power tools.

Finally, remove any jewelry or loose-hanging clothing before working on a computer. If you have long hair, you might consider tying it back in a ponytail. You don't want anything getting caught in a fan or stuck on a component. This can save you and your components a lot of pain.
