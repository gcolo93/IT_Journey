Effective Communication

When you deal with users, managers, and owners who are frustrated and upset because a computer or network is down and they can't work, your job requires you to take on the roles of detective and psychologist. Talking with frazzled and confused people and getting answers to questions about how the personal computing device got into the state it's in takes skill. Communicating clearly and effectively is important.

This section explores techniques for effective communication. It starts with assertive communication and then looks at issues involving respect. We'll examine methods for eliciting useful answers in a timely fashion. The section finishes with a discussion about managing expectations and professional follow-up actions.

Assertive Communication

In many cases, a computer problem results from user error or neglect. As a technician, you must show users the error of their ways without creating anger or conflict. You do this by using assertive communication. Assertive communication isn't pushy or bossy, but it's also not the language of a pushover. Assertive communication first requires you to show the other person that you understand and appreciate the importance of his feelings. Use statements such as "I know how frustrating it feels to lose data," or "I understand how infuriating it is when the network goes down and you can't get your job done." Statements like these cool off the situation and let customers know you are on their side. Avoid using the word "you," as it can sound accusatory.

The second part of assertive communication is making sure you state the problem clearly without accusing the user directly. Here's an example: "Help me understand how the network cable keeps getting unplugged during your lunch hour." Last, tell the user what you need to prevent this error in the future. "Please call me whenever you hear that buzzing sound," or "Please check the company's approved software list before installing anything." Always use "I" and "me," and never make judgments. "I can't promise the keyboard will work well if it's always getting dirty" is much better than "Stop eating cookies over the keyboard, you slob!"

Respectful Communication

Generally, IT folks support the people doing a company's main business. You are there to serve their needs and, all things being equal, to do so at their convenience, not yours.

You don't do the user's job, but you should respect that job and person as an essential cog in the organization. Communicate with users the way you would like them to communicate with you, were the roles reversed. Again, this follows the Ethic of Reciprocity.

Don't assume the world stops the moment you walk in the door and that you may immediately interrupt a customer's work to do yours. Although most customers are thrilled and motivated to help you the moment you arrive, this may not always be the case. Ask the magic question, "May I start working on the problem now?" Give customers a chance to wrap up, shut down, or do anything else necessary to finish their business and make it safe for you to do yours.

Engage the user with the standard rules of civil conversation. Actively listen. Avoid interrupting the customer as he or she describes a problem; just listen and take notes. You might hear something that leads to resolving the problem. Rephrase and repeat the problem back to the customer to verify you understand the issue ("So the computer is locking up three times a day?"). Use an even, nonaccusatory tone, and although it's okay to try to explain a problem if the user asks, never condescend and do not argue with a customer.

Maintain a positive attitude in the face of adversity. Don't get defensive if you can't figure something out quickly and the user starts hassling you. Remember that an angry customer isn't really angry with you---he's just frustrated---so don't take his anger personally. Instead, take it in stride; smile, project confidence, and assure him that computer troubleshooting sometimes takes a while.

Avoid distractions that take your focus away from the user and his or her computer problem. Things that break your concentration slow down the troubleshooting process immensely. Plus, customers will feel insulted if you start texting or talking to coworkers while interacting with the customer. You're not being paid to socialize, so turn those cell phones to vibrate. That's why the technogods created voicemail. Avoid personal interruptions or personal calls. Never take any call except one that is potentially urgent. If a call is potentially urgent, explain the urgency to the customer, step away, and deal with the call as quickly as possible.

Also, avoid texting and accessing social media sites while on the job. Checking Facebook or tweeting while your customer waits for his computer to get fixed is rude. And definitely never disclose experiences with customers via social media outlets.

Apply the Ethic of Reciprocity

The Ethic of Reciprocity appears in almost every religion on the planet, with versions attributed to Confucius, Jesus, Moses, and Mohammed, among others. Just for practice, try the Ethic of Reciprocity out in nontechnical situations, such as when buying something from the corner store or grocery. Consciously analyze how the clerk behind the counter would want a customer to interact with him or her. Now put yourself in the clerk's shoes. How would you want a customer to communicate with you? Act accordingly!

If you discover that the user caused the problem, either through ignorance or by accident, don't dismiss the customer's problem, but avoid being judgmental or insulting about the cause. We all screw up sometimes, and these kinds of mistakes are your job security. You get paid because people make mistakes and machines break. Chances are you'll be back at that workstation six months or a year later, fixing something else. By becoming the user's advocate and go-to person, you create a better work environment. If a mistaken action caused the problem, explain in a positive and supportive way how to do the task correctly, and then have the user go through the process while you are there to reinforce what you said.

Getting Answers

Your job as a tech is to get the computer fixed, and the best way to start that process is to determine what the computer is doing or not doing. You must start by talking to the customer. Allow the customer to explain the problem fully while you record the information.

Although each person is different, most users with a malfunctioning computer or peripheral will be distraught and perhaps defensive about the problem. There are methods for dealing with difficult customers or situations. You need to ask the right questions and listen to the customer's answers. Then ask the proper follow-up questions with the goal of getting answers that will help you troubleshoot the problem.

Always avoid accusatory questions because they won't help you in the least (see Figure 1-4). "What did you do?" generally gets a confused or defensive "Nothing" in reply, which doesn't get you closer to solving the problem. First, ask questions that help clarify customer statements. Repeat what you think is the problem after you've listened all the way through the user's story.

Figure 1-4  Never accuse!

Follow up with fact-seeking questions. "When did it last work?" "Has it ever worked in this way?" "Has any software changed recently?" "Has any new hardware been added?" Ask open-ended questions to narrow the scope of the problem ("Which applications are running when the computer locks up?").

By keeping your questions friendly and factual, you show users that you won't accuse them or judge their actions (see Figure 1-5). You also show them that you're there to help them. After the initial tension drops away, you'll often get more information: for instance, a recitation of something the user might have tried or changed. These clues can help lead to a quick resolution of the problem.

Figure 1-5  Keeping it friendly

Remember that you may know all about computer technology, but the user probably does not. This means a user will often use vague and/or incorrect terms to describe a particular computer component or function. That's just the way it works, so don't bother to correct the user. Wherever possible, use proper language and avoid jargon, acronyms, and slang when applicable. They simply confuse the already upset user and can make you sound like you're talking down to the user. Just ask direct, factual questions in a friendly tone, using simple, non-jargon language to zero in on what the user was trying to accomplish and what happened when things went wrong. Use visual aids when possible. Point at the machine or go to a working computer to have the user show what went wrong or what she did or tried to do.

People do usually want to get a handle on what you are doing---in a simplified way. You don't want to overwhelm them, but don't be afraid to use simple analogies or concepts to give them an idea of what is happening. If you have the time (and the skills), use drawings, equipment, and other visual aids to make technical concepts clearer. If a customer is a closet tech and is really digging for answers---to the point that it's affecting your ability to do your job---compliment her initiative, and then direct her to outside training opportunities. Better yet, tell her where she can get a copy of this book!

Beyond basic manners, never assume just because you are comfortable with friendly or casual behavior that the customer will be too. Even a casual user will expect you to behave with professional decorum. On the flip side, don't allow a user to put you in an awkward or even potentially dangerous or illegal situation. Never do work outside the scope of your assigned duties without the prior approval of your supervisor (when possible, in such cases, try to direct users to someone who can help them). You are not a babysitter. Never volunteer to "watch the kids" while the customer leaves the job site or tolerate a potentially unsafe situation if a customer isn't properly supervising a child. Concentrate on doing your job safely and efficiently, and maintain professional integrity.

Expectations and Follow-Up

Users are terrified when their computers and networks go down so hard that they need to call in a professional. Odds are good that they've left critical, or at least important, data on the computer. Odds are equally good they need this computer to work to do their job. When they're ready to lay down money for a professional, they're expecting you to make their system exactly the way it was before it broke. Hopefully you can do exactly that for them, but you also must deal with their expectations and let them know what to expect.

Equally, you should give your customers some follow-up after the job is finished. We've already covered data backups and Authorization of Work forms (and those are very important), but you need to keep the customers' needs in mind. You also want to keep the customer satisfied, should they need more help in the future. Here are a few items you should consider.

Timeline

If you can give the customer a best guess as to how long the repair will take, you'll be a hero. Don't be afraid to hold off on your time frame prediction until you've diagnosed the machine. If you truly don't have a feel for the time involved, tell the customer that and then tell him or her what you'll need to know before you can make the prediction.

Set and meet expectations, establish the timeline, and communicate status with the customer. Stick to the timeline. If you finish more quickly, great! People love a job that goes faster than predicted. If you're moving past the predicted time frame, contact the customer and tell him or her as soon as possible. Let him or her know what's happened, explain why you need more time, and give the customer a new time frame. The biggest secret here is to keep in communication with the customer on any change in status. People understand delays---they take place in our lives daily. People resent not knowing why a delay is occurring, especially when a precious computer is at stake.

Options

Many times with a computer issue, you can fix the problem and avoid a similar problem in the future in several ways. These options boil down to money. Offer repair/replacement options, as needed, and let the customer decide which route to take.

Route A might replace a faulty component with an upgraded component and a backup in case the new component fails in the future. Route B might replace the faulty device with an upgraded device. Route C might do an even device swap. Provide options and let the customer decide.

Documentation

At the completion of work, provide proper documentation of the services provided. Describe the problem, including the time and day you started work, the solution (again including the time and day the work ended), the number of hours you worked, and a list of all parts you replaced. If the customer owns the replaced parts, offer them to the customer (this is especially true if you replace any storage media). This documentation may or may not include your charges.

Follow-Up

Follow up with the customer/user at a later date to verify satisfaction. This can be simple follow-up, usually just a phone call, to confirm that the customer is happy with your work. This gives the customer a chance to detail any special issues that may have arisen, and it also adds that final extra touch that ensures he or she will call you again when encountering a technical problem.

Be Prepared!

Effective communication with your customer enables you to start the troubleshooting process, getting details about the problem and clues about things that happened around the same time. To continue troubleshooting, though, you need to be adept at handling computing devices. That starts with knowing how to handle computer components safely and how to use the tools of a tech. You also need a very clear troubleshooting methodology to guide your efforts. Let's look at these issues.
