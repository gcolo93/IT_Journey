Troubleshooting Methodology

An effective troubleshooting methodology follows a set of steps to diagnose and fix a computer. Troubleshooting methodology includes talking to users to determine how and when the problem took place, determining a cause, testing, verification, and documentation. Techs use a number of good troubleshooting methodologies. Luckily for those taking the CompTIA A+ 220-1101 certification exam, CompTIA clearly defines their vision of troubleshooting methodology:

5.1 Given a scenario, apply the best practice methodology to resolve problems.

1\.   Identify the problem

-   Gather information from the user, identify user changes, and, if applicable, perform backups before making changes

-   Inquire regarding environmental or infrastructure changes

2\.   Establish a theory of probable cause (question the obvious)

-   If necessary, conduct external or internal research based on symptoms

3\.   Test the theory to determine the cause

-   Once the theory is confirmed, determine the next steps to resolve the problem

-   If the theory is not confirmed, re-establish a new theory or escalate

4\.   Establish a plan of action to resolve the problem and implement the solution

-   Refer to the vendor's instruction for guidance

5\.   Verify full system functionality and, if applicable, implement preventive measures

6\.   Document the findings, actions, and outcomes

Identify the Problem

There's a reason you're standing in front of a computer to repair it: something happened that the user of the computer has identified as "not good." First, you need to identify the problem by talking to the user. Get the user to show you what's not good. Is it an error code? Is something not accessible? Is a device not responding?

Then ask the user that classic tech question (remember your communication skills here!): "Has anything recently changed on the computer that might have made this problem appear?" What you're really saying is: "Have you messed with the computer? Did you install some evil program? Did you shove a USB drive in so hard that you broke the connection?" Of course, you never say these things; simply ask nicely without accusing so the user can help you troubleshoot the problem (see Figure 1-14).

Ask also if any changes have happened in the environment around the workstation. Check for any infrastructure changes that might cause problems.

In most troubleshooting situations, it's important to back up critical files before making changes to a system. To some extent, this is a matter of proper ongoing maintenance, but if some important bit of data disappears and you don't have a backup, you know who the user will blame, don't you? (We cover backup options in detail in Chapter 14.)

EXAM TIP   The CompTIA A+ certification exams assume that all techs should back up systems every time before working on them, even though that's not how it works in the real world.

Establish a Theory of Probable Cause (Question the Obvious)

Now it's time to analyze the issue and come up with a theory as to what is wrong, a theory of probable cause. Personally, I prefer the word "guess" at this point because very few errors are so obvious that you'll know what to do. Fall back on your knowledge of the computing process to localize the issue based on the symptoms. Keep your guesses...err...theories...simple. One of the great problems for techs is their desire to overlook the obvious problems in their desire to dig into the system (see Figure 1-15).

Figure 1-15  Ford the Tech misses the obvious.

NOTE   Chapter 2 walks you through the computing process in some detail, showing how all the parts interact to "make the magic happen." The combination of a solid troubleshooting methodology and a fundamental understanding of the computing process is the core knowledge for techs for fixing things.

Research  In many situations, you'll need to access other resources to root out the most probable cause of the problem. Therefore, if necessary, you should conduct external or internal research based on the symptoms.

Use the Internet for external research. With the Internet quite literally at the fingertips of anyone with access to a smartphone or tablet, a short search online can result in swift answers to tech problems. If the customer's computer displays an error message, for example, put the whole error message into a search engine.

Internal research means asking other techs on-site for help. It means checking company records regarding a particular machine (for example, checking a problem-tracking database where previous issues have been recorded). This kind of search will reveal any known problems with the machine or with the user's actions.

Outside the Case  Take a moment to look for clues before you open up the case. Most importantly, use all your senses in the process.

What do you see? Is a connector mangled or a plastic part clearly damaged? Even if that connector or part works fine, the physical abuse could provide extra information. If the user can't connect to a network, check the cable. Did something roll over it to break the thin internal wires? Is that a jelly smear near the jammed optical drive door? (No pun intended, really!) A visual examination of the external computer is important.

When you put your hand on the system unit (that's the case that houses all the computer parts), does it feel hot? Can you feel or hear the vibrations of the fans? If not, that would be a clue to an overheating or overheated computer. Modern computers can run when overly hot, but generally run very sluggishly.

If you spend a moment listening to the computer, you might get some clues to problem sources. A properly running computer doesn't make a lot of sound, just a regular hum from the spinning fans. If you hear clicking or grinding sounds, that's a very bad sign and a very important clue! We'll cover data storage devices---a classic cause of clicking and grinding sounds---in detail in Chapters 8 and 9.

Finally, don't forget your nose. If you smell the unmistakable odor of ozone, you know that's the smell electronic components give off when they cook or are simply running much too hot.

Test the Theory to Determine the Cause

Okay, so you've decided on a theory that makes sense. It's time to test the theory to see if it fixes the problem. A challenge to fixing a computer is that the theory and the fix pretty much prove themselves at the same time. In many cases, testing your theory does nothing more than verify that something is broken. If that's the case, then replace the broken part.

If your theory doesn't pan out, you should come up with a new theory and test it. (In CompTIA speak, if the theory is not confirmed, you need to re-establish a new theory.) If you verify and the fix lies within your skill set, excellent.

At this point, you need to check in with management to make certain you have permission to make necessary changes. Always consider corporate policies, procedures, and impacts before implementing changes. Having the boss walk in frowning while you're elbows-deep in a machine with the question "Who gave you permission?" can make for a bad day!

If you don't have the skills---or the permissions---to fix the issue, you need to escalate the problem.

Escalation is the process your company (or sometimes just you) goes through when you---the person assigned to repair a problem---are not able to get the job done. It's okay to escalate a problem because no one can fix every problem. All companies should have some form of escalation policy. It might mean calling your boss. It might mean filling out and sending some in-house form to another department. Escalation is sometimes a more casual process. You might want to start researching the problem online; you might want to refer to in-house documentation to see if this problem has appeared in the past. (See "Document Findings, Actions, and Outcomes" later in this chapter.) You may want to call a coworker to come check it out (see Figure 1-16).

Figure 1-16  Ford the Tech asks for help from Scott.

Establish a Plan of Action to Resolve the Problem

At this point, you should have a good sense of the problem, including the scope and necessary permissions to do the job. You need to establish a plan of action to resolve the problem and implement the solution. Sometimes the plan requires a few steps before you can implement the solution. You might need additional resources such as known-good replacement parts. A backup of user data should be part of establishing a plan of action.

When working on vendor-specific equipment, refer to the vendor's instructions for guidance on how to troubleshoot. Often the vendor knows the quirks or possible failure points in their gear because many of their customers have broken things in the same place or same fashion.

Verify and Prevent

Fantastic! Through either your careful work or escalation, you've solved the problem, or so you think. Remember two items here. First, even though you think the problem is fixed, you need to verify with the customer/user that it's fixed. Second, try to do something to prevent the problem from happening again in the future, if possible.

Verify Full System Functionality  You need to verify full system functionality to make sure the user is happy. Let's say a user can't print. You determine that the Print Spooler service is stalled due to a locked-up laser printer. You reset the printer and all of the jobs start printing. Job done, right?

The best way to verify full system functionality is to have the user do whatever she needs to do on the repaired system for a few minutes while you watch. Any minor errors will quickly become apparent, and you might learn some interesting aspects of how the user does her job. Knowing what your users do is critical for good techs to help them do their jobs better (see Figure 1-17).

Figure 1-17  Ford the Tech sticks around and watches.

If Applicable, Implement Preventive Measures  A very smart tech once told me, "A truly good support tech's work goal should be to never have to get out of his chair." That's a pretty tall order, but it makes sense to me. Do whatever you can to prevent this problem from repeating. For some problems, there are obvious actions to take, such as making sure anti-malware is installed so a computer doesn't get infected again. Sometimes there's no action to take at all: nothing can prevent a hard drive that decides to die. But you can take one more critical action in almost every case: education. Take advantage of the time with the user to informally train him about the problem. Show him the dangers of malware or tell him that sometimes hard drives just die. The more your users know, the less time you'll spend out of your chair.

Document Findings, Actions, and Outcomes

Based on his famous quote, "Those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it," I think the philosopher George Santayana would have made a great technician. As a tech, the last step of every troubleshooting job should be to document your findings, actions, and outcomes. This documentation might be highly formalized in some organizations, or it might just be a few notes you jot down for your own use, but you must document! What was the problem? What did you do to fix it? What worked? What didn't? The best guide to use for documentation is: "What would I have liked to have known about this problem before I walked up to it?" Good documentation is the strongest sign of a good tech (see Figure 1-18).

Figure 1-18  Ford documents a successful fix.

Documenting problems helps you track the troubleshooting history of a computing device over time, enabling you to make longer-term determinations about retiring it or changing out more parts. If you and fellow techs fix a specific problem with Mary's laptop several times, for example, you might decide to swap out her whole system rather than fix it a fourth time.

Documenting helps fellow techs if they have to follow up on a task you didn't finish or troubleshoot a machine you've worked on previously. The reverse is also true. If you get a call about Frank's computer, for example, and check the records to find other service calls on his computer, you might find that the fix for a particular problem is already documented. This is especially true for user-generated problems. Having documentation of what you did also means you don't have to rely on your memory when your coworker asks what you did to fix the weird problem with Jane's computer a year ago!

Documenting also comes into play when you or a user has an accident on-site. If your colleague Joe drops a monitor on his foot and breaks both the monitor and his foot, for example, you need to fill out an incident report, just as you would with any kind of accident: electrical, chemical, or physical. An incident report should detail what happened and where it happened. This helps your supervisors take the appropriate actions quickly and efficiently.
