**Section 16: Monitoring and Controlling Project Constraints**

**Project Inspection**

- Comparing baselines, including approved changes, to actual results
- Determining probability project will be completed as planned
- Identifying actions to ensure that accurate work results in project
- Scope validation
- Quality control

**Inspection Report Components**

- Project baseline and status comparison
  - Completeness of actual project results
  - Overall project status
  - Project on track or deviating from project plans
- Change recommendations
  - Recommended changes for scope, schedule, and costs
- Scope and methodology
  - Audit purpose and approach
  - Measurements utilized
  - Assumptions or constraints of audit

**Control Scope**

- Are changes agreed upon?
- Has the change already happened?
- How to manage the existing change?
- How to incorporate changes?
- What baselines are affected?

**Variance Analysis**

- Performance measurements
- Magnitude of variation
- Determine cause and degree of variance
- Corrective or preventive action

**Trend Analysis**

- Project performance over time
- Earned value management
- Performance improving or deteriorating
- Degree of variance
- Corrective or preventive actions

**Scheduling Techniques**

- Gathering resources
- Schedules of people who will be working on the project, including outsourced vendors
- Vacation time for staff on the project
- Other projects that team members are involved in that may conflict with this project
- Schedules for materials and resources

**Deadlines are constraints**

- Project deadline
- Phase deadlines
- Business cycles
- Holidays

**Gantt Chart**

- Green is completed work
- Red is work to-do
- Length of bar shows duration
- No resources - progress only

**Burn down chart**

- Burning down the number of tasks per iteration or per project
- Shows ideal and actual effort by project team
- Usually in Agile projects

**Earned Value Management (EVM) Foundation**

- EV = %Complete x BAC
  - EV = 40% x 250,000
  - EV = 100,000
- PV = %Planned x BAC
  - PV = 55% x 250,000
  - PV = 137,500







**Finding the Variances**

- Cost Variance:
  - EV - AC
  - 100,000 - 112,000 = -12,000
- Schedule Variance
  - EV - PV
  - 100,000 - 137,500 = -37,500

**Measuring Performance**

- Cost Performance Index (CPI)
  - EV / AC
  - 100k/112k = .89
- Schedule Performance Index (SPI)
  - EV / PV
  - 100k/137,500 = .73

**Predicting the Future**

- Estimate at Completion (EAC)
  - BAC / CPI
  - 250k / .89 = 280k
- Estimate to Complete
  - EAC - AC
  - 280k - 112k = 168k

**Implementing Problem-Solving Techniques**

- Define the problem
- Define the problemâ€™s root cause
- Generate solution
- Select best solution
- Implement the solution
- Verify solution effectiveness

**Random and Special Variance**

- Random causes are everyday occurrences
  - Common causes
  - Always present
  - Insignificant or dramatic effect
- Special causes
  - Assignable, causes are unusual, sporadic occurrences
  - Some unexpected circumstance
  - Not caused by a flaw in the overall production process
